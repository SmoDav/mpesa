Banks head lower following rate hike
The major averages, bonds, and gold have all turned higher after the Fed lifted the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, but satiated bank bulls might be lightening up just a hair.After all, the "dots" showed the Fed as being no more hawkish than a couple of meetings back when it surprised the world by predicting three rate hikes this year. Inflation and growth expectations were essentially unchanged as well.So while the Fed may have been faster with a rate hike than many expected just a couple of weeks back, it appears the timetable past today remains the same.KBE -0.15%, KRE -0.1%, XLF flatJanet Yellen's press conference is just getting underway.Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), Citigroup (C -0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.1%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.3%), PNC Financial (PNC -0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY +0.2%), Regions Financial (RF), SunTrust (STI -1%), Fifth Third (FITB -0.7%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

Bureaucracy 1, Dodd-Frank reformers 0
For now, Washington D.C. is winning the battle against those in favor of quickly rolling back swaths of Dodd-Frank. For now, the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee are working on other things, while Republicans instead spend political capital on things like Obamacare repeal and tax reform.Barney Frank is taking a victory lap, telling Bloomberg nothing substantial will get through Congress. He does expect the possibility of relief for smaller banks, but the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and others probably shouldn't be holding their breath for big changes.KBW's Brian Gardner: “Changes to the Dodd-Frank Act are second-tier agenda items and are unlikely to pass Congress in the near term ... Improvement in the regulatory regime is likely to be subtle and not seen by the public."

Banks move to overhaul money laundering rules - Reuters
The Clearing House - a trade association representing the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) - for some time has questioned the effectiveness of current rules, but now may find a friendlier reception in D.C.Source: Reuters"Now we tell banks to file a (report) on everything that might be criminal," says the head of a compliance software maker, summing up the problem with the current rules. The number of suspicious activity reports rose to nearly 1M last year vs. 669K in 2013.Compliance with the rules is costing U.S. companies up to $8B per year, according to the Heritage Foundation.The new system to be proposed by The Clearing House envisions banks not investigating and reporting every red flag transaction, but instead looking into specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement. Lenders in different parts of the country may, for instance, be on the lookout for different sorts of activity.

Party continues for big banks: BofA leads with 2% gain
There's nothing too new in Janet Yellen's 2nd day on Capital Hill. As with yesterday, she's giving off a more hawkish vibe than at least some may have expected. The 10-year Treasury yield is higher by three basis points to 2.50%, and Fed Funds futures are now pricing in nearly a 50% chance of a March rate hike (up from less than 25% a few days back).The Fed boss is naturally offering a defense of the current regulatory regime, including the Volcker Rule and the CCAR, but the Trump administration, its now-confirmed Treasury Secretary and the leaders of key congressional committees are working to roll back much of Dodd-Frank.XLF (XLF +0.6%), KBE (KBE +0.4%), KRE (KRE +0.2%)Bank of America (BAC +2.2%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.8%), Citigroup (C +1.2%), Morgan Stanley (MS +1.1%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.9%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.9%)

Dollar, banks on the move as Yellen leans hawkish
Testifying before the Senate this morning, Fed Chair Janet Yellen says it would be "unwise" to delay on rate hikes, thus suggesting a move in March could be more likely than previously thought.The 10-year Treasury yield is higher by 6.7 basis points to 2.50%, and Fed Funds futures are pricing in slightly more hawkish Fed policy for the remainder of the year.Also notable was lack of much mention of regulation in Yellen's opening remarks. There had been thought that Yellen would use the opportunity to push back against Trump administration and congressional calls for a sizable rollback of Dodd-Frank and the stress test regime.Welcoming news of higher rates (and no news yet on regulations) is the financial sector: (XLF +0.7%), (KBE +1.2%), (KRE +1.3%)Bank of America (BAC +2%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.2%), Citigroup (C +1.5%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.2%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2%), Regionsl Financial (RF +1.8%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.2%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.5%), PNC Financial (PNC +0.8%), Fifth Third (FITB +1.6%), Lincoln National (LNC +1.7%) MetLife (MET +0.8%), AIG (AIG +0.8%)The dollar (UUP +0.4%) has also moved higher since Yellen took the stage.

Lenders lead advance as House's Hensarling lays out his plans
Writing in the WSJ last night, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau a rogue agency, purposely created to be insulated from Congressional, presidential, or voter oversight."The regulatory web spun by the CFPB can make every provider of financial services guilty until proven innocent, inviting selective enforcement and financial shakedowns."He notes Dodd-Frank specifically excluded auto lenders from CFPB jurisdiction, but that hasn't stopped Richard Cordray (CFPB chief) and company, as the likes of Santander Consumer (SC +1.2%), Ally Financial (ALLY +1%), and Credit Acceptance Corp. (CACC +1.9%) have found out. The House two years ago voted overwhelmingly voted to stop the CFPB's efforts in this area, but Elizabeth Warren was able to halt the bill in the Senate.The president, says Hensarling, should fire Richard Cordray yesterday, put in place a new director to undo all harmful actions taken by the agency, and then get to work putting policies to work that actually protect consumers.Even with better leadership, though, the CFPB would still be unconstitutional, he continues, so the agency must be "functionally terminated" through a simple majority vote to cut off funding (which comes from the Fed, not Congress).In other Hensarling news, Bloomberg has seen a memo outlining other Dodd-Frank reforms, including reducing stress tests to just every other year.XLF +1.3%, KRE +1.5%, KBE +1.3%OneMain (OMF +4.4%), BofA (BAC +1.6%), Citigroup (C +1.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2.2%), Regions (RF +2.7%), KeyCorp (KEY +1%), SunTrust (STI +1.6%), BB&T (BBT +1.1%), M&T (MTB +1.2%), Zions (ZION +2%)

Fiduciary rule still in focus
A Dallas federal judge has upheld the Labor Department's fiduciary rule, dealing a setback to the financial industry's attempts to kill the measure.But the legal move may not mean much for the regulation's fate.Last Friday, President Trump issued a memorandum to study the rule's impact and rescind or revise it if it isn't consistent with his administration's regulatory principles.

Banks and asset managers higher as Trump takes aim at Dodd-Frank, DOL rule
The president later today is expected to sign executive orders to scale back Dodd-Frank and to postpone implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary role."We’re not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year,” White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn tells the WSJ. “The banks are going to be able to price product more efficiently and more effectively to consumers ... This is a table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming."The moves are sure to upset consumer groups and the opposition party, not to mention the ambitious CFPB and its director Richard Cordray (of whom, Cohn implies his days heading that agency are numbered).KRE +1.45%, KBE +1.6%Bank of America (BAC +2.1%), Citigroup (C +2%), Goldman (GS +3%), Morgan Stanley (MS +3.3%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.9%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.5%), PNC (PNC +1.5%), Invesco (IVZ +3.6%), T.

Banks lead decline on Wall Street
The KBE and KRE are each down more than 2% vs. the S&P 500's 1% retreat.Pick your excuse, but the best explanation is probably seen in the sharp upward and to the right price charts of the banking sector names, and the occasional need to take a breath.There's also politics, and Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin over the weekend provided more evidence that the Trump administration intends to tweak, but not gut Dodd-Frank. At issue is the Volcker Rule which prohibits lenders from taking risky bets with federally-insured deposits.Mnuchin in a letter to lawmakers: "A legal distinction between the insured and non-insured entity is an important factor ... I do not believe that the uninsured entity should be able to perform proprietary trading."Bank of America (BAC -2.4%), Citigroup (C -1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.4%), Morgan Stanley (MS -2.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -0.9%), Regions Financial (RF -1.5%), KeyCorp (KEY -2.3%), Fifth Third (FITB -2.3%).

Opportunity for other card companies as CapOne exits Cabela's deal
Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) had a rough session yesterday after Capital One (NYSE:COF) said it doesn't expect regulatory approval for the two's card deal.This could present opportunity for others, says the team at Stephens, which suggests Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and TD Bank (NYSE:TD) may have interest in the portfolio.In Synchrony's case, says Stephens, a purchase at a 10% premium to assets would be 5-10% accretive to earnings.For now, Bass Pro is likely to manage the portfolio in-house and put it up for sale yesterday.Source: BloombergPreviously: Capital One down 1.8% following earnings miss (Jan. 24)

Wall Street moves south
Known as "nearshoring," the trend - in which banks move operations away from expensive financial centers like New York to places like Salt Lake City, or North Carolina, or Jacksonville (the focus of this particular article in Bloomberg) - isn't a new one.It's a way to lower costs without heading out of the country - of particular import given the new leadership in D.C. In the case of Jacksonville, high-end corporate office space can be had for about $22 per square foot - roughly 25% of the rate in NYC. Bank employees in Jacksonville earn about 30% less than those in The Big Apple.For workers, the cost of living is appreciably lower, commute times shorter, and a walk on the beach is possible at lunch. They do have to give up things like round-the-clock delivery of any imaginable food, though.Among those with operations in Jacksonville: Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), BofA (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).

Rejection of Aetna/Humana deal could cast pall over M&A - Compass Point
Yesterday's court ruling against the $37B merger of Humana and Aetna alone could cost investment banks more than $100M, according to Compass Point's Charles Peabody, including $41M for Goldman (NYSE:GS), $45M for Citi (NYSE:C), and $15M for Lazard (NYSE:LAZ).Then there's other pending deals like Anthem/Cigna, AT&T/Time Warner, Monsanto/Bayer, and their key advisors like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citi.In addition to what regulators might say, M&A animal spirits may retreat to the sidelines until potential corporate tax changes become clearer.Bottom line: Q1 estimates at the money center banks are assuming improvement in capital markets results, not the lull that might instead be coming (Compass Point is expecting a 15% rise in announced M&A volumes this year to $4.2T).Source: BloombergETFs: KCE

Breakups may still be on agenda for big banks
After the big rally in the banks since roughly this time last year, the clamor for breaking them up has died down. Return on equity, however, remains historically low, and the chiefs of the Too Big To Fail lenders may again find themselves facing calls to break up or sell off assets, write Lionel Laurent and Gillian Tan at Bloomberg.Citigroup (NYSE:C) makes for an obvious case - its price to tangible book value ratio is less than 1x, a sizable discount to peers (WFC and JPM are approaching 2x, and BAC, MS, GS are all around 1.3x). At least part of that is due to Citi's lower returns and sizable overseas exposure, they write.Should an activist get involved, it could come alongside the appointment of, say, Thomas Hoenig - a supporter of bringing back Glass-Steagall - as vice chair of the Fed (though word is Hoenig has moved to #2 on the depth chart for that spot).

Investors give 'thumbs up' to bank earnings; KBE +2.3%
There was a bit of caution among bank investors in the past couple of days, but they're back to buying low and selling high this morning as the initial results from Q4 begin to pour in. Among those reporting today: Bank of America (BAC +1.8%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.9%), Wells Fargo (WFC +2.8%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.4%), First Horizon (FHN -0.3%).KBE +2.3%, KRE +2.5%; the S&P 500 is ahead 0.3%.An early take from KBW's Bose George: Mortgage banking trends are weakening in line with expectations - with stronger volumes being offset by lower gain-on-sale margins. Higher rates are still filtering through though, and industry sources and recent data suggest volumes falling 10-15% this quarter.Piper's Kevin Barker calls Wells Fargo's operating numbers "decent," but notes rising auto loan net charge-offs - 1.05% in Q4  vs. 0.87% in Q3, and 0.59% a year earlier.Bloomberg's Alison Williams takes note of the positive signal of boosted buybacks at Bank of America, and calls cost cuts "key." It's hard to get too excited about any particular metric given the bank's near-50% run higher in the past few months.Other players: Goldman (GS +1.1%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2%), Citigroup (C +1.6%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.3%), Regions Financial (RF +3.2%), New York Community (NYCB +1.3%), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN +2.2%), KeyCorp (KEY +2.3%)

Banks lead S&P 500 lower as bulls lighten up ahead of earnings

It's lower by 1.9% on today's session vs. the S&P 500's 0.5% decline.Giving well-fed financial sector bulls another reason to take some profits is the continued decline in interest rates over the past few weeks, with the 10-year yield lower by another six basis points today to 2.32% - it topped at about 2.60% in mid-December.KeyCorp (KEY -2%), Regions Financial (RF -1.5%), Fifth Third (FITB -1.5%), State Street (STT -1.7%), MetLife (MET -1.9%), Prudential (PRU -2.9%), E*Trade (ETFC -1.5%), Schwab (SCHW -1.2%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

Free speech in explaining credit card fees
There is a lively argument going on at the Supreme Court - with justices considering how the First Amendment applies to credit card fees.At issue is a dispute over the "freedom of speech" for merchants, who want to avoid charges by steering customers toward cash, and payment companies, which seek to make the fees invisible.But New York law, similar to ones in nine other states, bars credit card "surcharges," while permitting "cash discounts."Related tickers: AXP, BAC, C, COF, DFS, JPM, MA, V

Financials sink alongside rates and retail
The S&P 500 is lower by just 0.3%, but the financial sector (XLF -1.9%) is taking a sizable breather from its big post-election run.Those buying on hopes for the long-awaited sustained rise in interest rates might be pausing as the 10-year yield sinks seven basis points to 2.37%. Two weeks ago, it was at 2.60%.Bond bears have at least a couple of excuses to lighten up today. One might be softer-than-hoped jobs numbers from ADP. Or maybe economy bulls are mulling the carnage in retail (XRT -3.2%) - unless you happen to be Amazon (+2.3%) - following guidance, job, and store cuts at Macy's, and another 150 closings at Sears, as well as weak numbers from players like Kohl's.Bank of America (BAC -2.6%), Citigroup (C -2.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC -2.8%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.9%), Morgan Stanley (MS -3.1%), Regions Financial (RF -2.6%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -1.9%), KeyCorp (KEY -1.7%), Fifth Third (FITB -2.9%), Schwab (SCHW -1.5%), MetLife (MET -2.4%), AIG (AIG -1.4%)

Fed adopts bailout prevention rule, forcing big banks to issue more debt
The Fed votes to adopt a bailout prevention rule that will force big banks to issue substantial amounts of new long-term debt, largely upholding a draft issued early this year.Half of the eight largest U.S. banks would need to issue ~$70B in fresh debt or equity to satisfy the new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity standard, the Fed estimates.In all, the Fed says U.S. banks’ funding costs would increase by $680M-$2B annually, higher than the upper estimate of $1.5B in its October 2015 proposal.Fed officials do not identify the four banks that lack sufficient debt; Wells Fargo (WFC +1.6%) said in November it envisioned issuing at least an additional $29B in debt to satisfy the rule.Besides WFC, the banks expected to satisfy the new rule are JPMorgan Chase (JPM +1.9%), Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Citigroup (C +1.6%), State Street (STT +1.1%), BNY Mellon (BK +1.4%), Morgan Stanley (MS +0.9%) and Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%).

Janet Yellen's post-hike press conference - Live Coverage
3:22 ET The press conference ends with stocks at or about session lows, the S&P 500 down 0.8%, the Dow down 0.7%, and Nasdaq down 0.5%.3:14 ET Bill Gross chimes in ... Today's rate hike and hawkish expectations for 2017 may have marked the top of the bank rally, he says. Not all higher rates are created equal, and if Fed rate boosts flatten the yield curve, it wouldn't be good for bank margins, he says. Banks have reversed big post-hike gains, with losses now about inline with the S&P 500's 0.75% decline. Citigroup (C -0.6%), Wells Fargo (WFC -1.9%), JPMorgan (JPM -0.3%), New York Community Bank (NYCB -0.6%), PNC Financial (PNC -0.7%), BB&T (BBT -0.8%). Insurers give up their gains as well: Prudential (PRU -1.3%), MetLife (MET -0.8%), Lincoln National (LNC -1.8%).3:09 ET Asked about Dow 20K, Yellen first says she's not going to comment on the level of stock prices, but then says - given the low level of interest rates - stocks seem to be valued within normal ranges.3:06 ET "I do intend to serve out my four-year term (as Fed Chair)," she says, when asked if anything has changed on her immediate future given the election results. Whether she get another four-year term after that, or simply moves back to the Board of Governors is a question for another day.2:59 ET Asked how she feels about the president elect's views on easing big chunks of post-crisis financial regulation, Yellen says she's thinks D.C. (Fed included) has done a good job of insuring against a repeat, and wouldn't be a fan of a big rollback. She does think the burden on smaller institutions needs to be relieved. As for any contact with the Trump team, Yellen says it's only been at the staff level and only to help ensure a smooth transition.2:53 ET I'm not trying to give advice to the incoming administration, says Yellen, after opining that additional fiscal stimulus at this point is probably not necessary to get the economy back to full employment.2:50 ET Up sharply in the immediate aftermath of the Fed rate hike and more hawkish expectations for next year, the banks have given up those gains, and turned lower. The KBE is down 0.4%.2:46 ET Asked by CNBC's Steve Liesman if plans for big fiscal spending and tax cuts would alter the Fed's plans, Yellen says she won't speculate on their impact without more details. Some at the central bank, however, did incorporate greater fiscal stimulus in their forecasts, she says.2:43 ET First questioner wants to know if the Fed hiked rates because Trump was elected. Yellen isn't biting, and notes today's hike, along with the more hawkish "dots" are just modest adjustements.2:40 ET Continued moderate economic growth will warrant "gradual tightening," but the outlook is "highly uncertain" and the path of fiscal policy is unknown.2:34 ET The post-FOMC meeting press conference is getting underway. The Fed minutes ago hiked the Fed Funds target rate 25 basis points to a range of 0.5-0.75%, and somewhat surprisingly ratcheted higher its expectations for 2017 rate increases - now seeing three vs. two expected at the last forecast three months ago.The broad market indices have moved lower, with the S&P 500 down 0.4%.Webcast here

Morgan Stanley: Banks now growth stocks
The Republican sweep, with lower taxes, and deficit-led growth plans is a "major tailwind" for banks, says analyst Betsy Graseck in Morgan Stanley's 2017 outlook.The big banks should now be though of as "growth stocks," as they will outperform in a rising inflation environment.A "new age of bank EPS growth" is upon us, she says. noting favorites like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), SunTrust (NYSE:STI), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Bank of New York (NYSE:BK), Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS), State Street (NYSE:STT), AmEx (NYSE:AXP), Capital One (NYSE:COF), Discover (NYSE:DFS), and Synchrony (NYSE:SYF).Source: BloombergPreviously: BAML survey a warning sign for bank bull market (Dec. 13)Previously: Don't ring the register on bank stocks yet - Oppenheimer (Dec. 12)

Don't ring the register on bank stocks yet - Oppenheimer
Some numbers to start: From the bottom of the great credit scare at the start of the year, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rose 33% up to the election, topping the S&P 500 by a big 12% during that period. Since the election, bank stocks have outperformed by another 12%, lifting their relative P/E to 77% of the S&P 500 (from 60% at the Feb. bottom).Though it probably doesn't make sense to be as bullish today at fancier valuations, Oppenheimer's Chris Kotwoski would still "let the bet ride.""Goldilocks" is a phrase that hasn't been mentioned much since The Maestro ran the Fed, but Kotowski drags it out, and says it could be applicable in 2017-18, with credit costs staying low, expenses tamped down, and revenues set to get a lift.His favorites names: Bank of America (BAC -2.2%), Citigroup (C -1.9%), CIT Group (CIT -1.6%), and Goldman Sachs (GS -2.2%)ETFs: KBE, KRE

Citi's CFO: Buybacks still make sense
Trading revenues should be up 20% Y/Y in Q4, says Citigroup (C +0.6%) CFO John Gerspach, speaking at the Goldman Sachs financial services conference. This compares to the 15% gains mentioned by BofA and JPMorgan at their presentations yesterday.The credit card business is a current bright spot, he says, with the Costco partnership working "extraordinarily well."As opposed to Jamie Dimon - who thinks the stock price of JPMorgan is high enough to maybe postpone buybacks in favor of a special dividend - Gerspach says there's enough room between Citi's share price and book value for repurchases to continue to make good sense.While Gerspach doesn't want to Citi to get back into prop trading, he says the Volcker rule's record-keeping requirements are a big burden and the prop trading ban has hurt liquidity.Source: Bloomberg

Buy any dip in bank stocks - Morgan Stanley
After a three standard deviation move in large-cap bank stocks, it seems logical to think about heading to the sidelines, says analyst Betsy Graseck. But should the names pull back, she recommends adding to positions as the bull case still outweighs the bear case next year.Using base case 2018 estimates and a target P/E of 12x implies 14% upside for Morgan's eight Overweight-rated stocks. The bull case on 2018 estimates with the same target P/E means upside of 41%.Top picks are Citigroup (NYSE:C), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) on stronger capital returns; Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on higher rates and lower expenses; Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on rising market volatility and improving VAR productivity; JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) on stronger loan growth and expense management; Capital One (NYSE:COF) and Discover (NYSE:DFS) on rising consumer leverage and higher capital return.

Financial sector midday report: Surge continues
The FRBNY's William Dudley isn't concerned about the post-election jump in rates at the long end of the curve, and says the Fed is about to start following suit at the short end.Even the dovish Charles Evans from the Chicago Fed admits inflation is getting closer to the central bank's target, and the labor market is close to full employment.The 10-year Treasury yield had moved as high as 2.45%, but has pulled back to 2.40%, still up 1.5 basis points on the session.On the regulatory front, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on Friday set himself up as the chief defender of the current bank regulatory regime, but whether his voice will be heard is a different story given the incoming administration, which looks to be staffed with those favoring a far lighter regulatory hand.Financial sector stocks today are about doubling the S&P 500's 0.5% advance.TBTF banks: Bank of America (BAC +2.3%), Citigroup (C +1.8%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.9%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +0.4%)Regional lenders: U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.7%), PNC Financial (PNC +0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY -0.8%), Fifth Third (FITB +0.5%)Insurers: MetLife (MET +0.3%), Lincoln National (LNC), AIG (AIG +0.2%)Brokerage: Schwab (SCHW +0.9%), E*Trade (ETFC +0.9%)Custodial banks: State Street (STT +0.5%), Northern Trust (NTRS +1%)Private equity: Blackstone (BX +0.9%), KKR (KKR +1%)Asset Management: BlackRock (BLK +0.1%), Franklin Resources (BEN +0.5%), Affiliated Managers (AMG +1.8%)

Banks continue surge on higher rates, lower regulation
There are multi-year highs again across the sector as interest rates continue to rise, but, maybe more importantly, bank investors begin to envision a far less heavy regulatory burden.In a speech Friday described by FBR's Ed Mills as "going out swinging," Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo set himself up as the chief defender of the status quo, saying he doesn't see a "sound economic case" for rolling back the post-crisis regulatory regime.Whether anyone hears him much going forward is a different story, given names like former BB&T boss John Allison or former FDIC chief Thomas Hoenig being thrown around as possible Fed vice chairmen for bank supervision. Both Allison and Hoenig are fans of following simple leverage ratios, but Tarullo says just focusing on those is "inadequate and dangerous."Tarullo's voice will also have to rise above that of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum led by Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman.XLF +1.15%, KRE +1.1%, KBE +1.25%Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.4%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.6%), Citigroup (C +2.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.5%), Synovus (SNV +1.1%), SunTrust (STI +1.4%), Primerica (PRI +2.1%), Bank of New York (BNY +1.4%), State Street (STT +1.1%)

Barron's searches for value in its top stock picks for 2017
Rather than chase surging stocks at fancy valuations, the team at Barron's looked for laggards when making its picks, writes Andrew Bary.The names, nevertheless, aren't exactly unfamiliar ones: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), Unilever (NYSE:UL), Disney (NYSE:DIS).Eight of these ten are trailing the S&P 500 this year, including the three European stocks (Deutsche Telekom, Novartis, and Unilever), and all of the names except Google sell for less than 20x 2017 estimates.At just 10x earnings, Toll Brothers, Citi, and Delta are better ways to play an improving economy than Caterpillar at nearly 30x.As for the "pricey" Google, it's an example of the Buffett maxim that he'd rather buy a wonderful business at a fair price rather than a fair business at a wonderful price.Barron's top picks for 2016 as a group are trailing the S&P 500 by more than 600 basis points.

Citigroup adds $1.75B to buyback
The bank has received a "non-objection" from the Fed to add $1.75B to its stock repurchase authorization. This would be in addition to the $10.4B of capital returns approved earlier this year (dividend of $0.16 per share and $8.6B buyback).At current prices, $1.75B would be enough to buy back another 31.5M shares against a float of 2.85B shares.C +0.7% premarket

Goldman upgraded at Macquarie; Citi cut
There aren't any details yet available, but the upgrade is worth noting on its own as it comes following a huge rally in bank stocks, and amid a wave of sell-side downgrades this week (as price target levels are breached).Macquarie upgrades Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to Outperform. The $245 price target suggests about 17% upside.Goldman is higher by 24% over the past month - with nearly all of the advance since the election. Shares are up just 10% YTD.Alongside, the team downgrades Citigroup (NYSE:C) to Neutral as the $56 price target is within pennies of being hit. Citi is higher by 14% over the past month and 7% YTD.

Donald Trump's victory throws into question the core assumption the Fed will raise interest rates soon and follow with further gradual hikes over coming years.Banks are struggling on the news.

China may finally open itself up to Wall Street banks - WSJ
China is considering allowing Wall Street banks to run their own investment-banking businesses on the mainland, dropping a requirement for U.S. banks to operate as minority partners in local joint ventures, WSJ says.Doing so would give them more access to Chinese domestic markets that have been hard to crack.Any deal would likely ultimately to extend to all foreign banks, not just U.S. firms.Foreign investment banks have less than a 5% market share in investment banking, trading and other securities businesses in China's $7.5T market.Stocks potentially affected: GS, JPM, MS, C

Bloomberg: Citi reaps $300M derivative profit
So much for the Volcker Rule? Citigroup's (NYSE:C) U.S. dollar interest-rate swaps desk pulled down about $300M this year serving clients making bets on the direction of short-term rates, according to a Bloomberg story.This report follows another from last week in which one trader earned more than $100M buying junk debt at the lows early this year.Part of Dodd-Frank financial reforms, the Volcker Rule was supposed to eliminate or at least limit banks from making these sorts of bets, and turn trading desks into little more than facilitators of client trades.In the case of Goldman, word is the trader was a buyer as clients were eager to sell amid the early market jitters this year. He later found other buyers at higher prices. Citi declined to comment on its desk's gains, though surely some of those profits simply came from volume amid a good deal of rate volatility this year.

Credit card wars could crimp banks
Customers of offerings like JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) Sapphire Reserve card can't believe their good fortune, but bank shareholders can't be faulted for wondering whether there's going to be any profits from the growing rewards war."You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," says Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski.It's the banking version of a loss leader. The upfront rewards are well above the annual fee, but if customers hold onto the card after the first year, and better yet hold a balance, they could become profitable."It has been a huge success," says the bank's card boss, Kevin Watters. Speaking on Friday's earnings call, CFO Marianne Lake declined to say how much card debt customers need to take on before a profit can be turned.Citigroup's (NYSE:C) spending on cards has also been aggressive, but personal finance gurus say its Prestige premium card needs to up its rewards game to compete with JPMorgan's offering.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) also naturally want to boost card business, but until now have mostly refrained from joining the war, and earlier this month, American Express (NYSE:AXP) boosted rewards on its Platinum card, though saying publicly the move wasn't in response to JPMorgan and Citi.

Citi hasn't found Wells-like abuses
Speaking to reporters ahead of the bank's 11:30 ET earnings call, CFO John Gerspach says Citigroup (NYSE:C) hasn't identified any sales abuses similar to those at Wells Fargo. Presentation slidesEarlier: JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said her bank found nothing systemic, but acknowledged "zero defects" isn't a reasonable expectation.In other comments from Gerspach, he says the woes of Deutsche Bank have helped boost Citi's market share, and sees Citi rising to fifth or sixth in equity trading ranking. In the bank's Q3 results, bond-trading revenue jumped a full 35% Y/Y, but equity revenue slumped 34%. "Not particularly pleased" with the results, Gerspach says Citi remains committed to growth at the unit. "This is a process." (Is he applying to be the 76ers GM?).Up sharply earlier, the banks are giving back some ground, with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo now red, and Citi higher by just 0.35%.

Latest stress test changes bad news for TBTFs, good news for smaller players
"Large banks are going to be forced to take on more capital," says Dick Bove. "It will make the cost of funding more, not less, expensive. It will reduce the appeal for investors to put money at risk in the banking system."Bove is commenting on a weekend announcement from Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo promising future stress tests will be geared to demanding even higher cash buffers for banks. Set to take effect next year, the new rule could raise capital requirements for the largest banks by 3 or 4 percentage points, writes Jeff Cox at CNBC.Interested parties: BAC, C, WFC, JPM, GS, MSThere's good news though, as those lenders with less than $250B in assets won't be subject to the same standards. FBR's Edward Mills calls it a "significant positive" for regionals, which now have more certainly on the process, reduced regulatory expenses, and thus the ability to return more capital to owners.Interested parties: RF, ZION, CMA, KEY, FITB, STI, NYCB, HBAN, PNC, BBT, MTBETFs: KRE, KBE, IAT, KBWB, QABA, KBWR, KRU, PSCF, KRS, WDRW, DPST

Either bank stocks are easy money or the market is set for a fall
"How can a market trading for 17-18x forward earnings be anchored to a financial system that only merits a 12-13x multiple," asks Convergex's Nicholas Colas. "Why should U.S. equities overall be up 5-12% and banks stocks only flat on the year?"Checking back to other times when broader markets diverged from the financial sector - 2000 and 2007 come to mind - Colas finds the resolution didn't work out too well. The bottom line, says Colas: Either bank stocks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of American (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) are a slam-dunk buy headed into the end of the year, or the markets are about to have a serious problem.

Citi returns to Saudi Arabia
The bank exited Saudi Arabia more than a decade ago, but of late has been winning more high-profile deals and is quietly planning on competing for more, according to Bloomberg.Citi (NYSE:C) according to the report, has set up a company-wide task force targeting opportunities in The Kingdom. The payoff: It was chosen as lead advisor on Saudi Arabia's first international bond sale next month which could be for up to $10B. The big prize though would be the fee bonanza coming from economic reforms, including plans to create the world's largest sovereign wealth fund and an IPO of Aramco."The bank now has a great deal of excess capital ... it is in the mood to invest," says Atlantic Equities' Christopher Wheeler.

Fed moves forward with bank commodity restrictions
The proposed rule would make it more difficult for banks to be involved with physical commodities by raising capital requirements. Further, banks would be prohibited from activities involving power plants, and owning or storing copper.The Fed today begins a 90-day period of accepting public comment.Banks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) have relied on grandfather clauses to engage in physical commodity businesses not allowed for other lenders, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) remain somewhat involved in commodity trading and energy tolling activities.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF Sep. 23, 2016, 12:05 PM | 11 Comments

Wells Fargo scam a problem for all the big banks - Cowen
The head of the CFPB was on the tape earlier saying the Wells Fargo (WFC -3.1%) account opening case isn't a signal of a broader problem in the industry, but Cowen's Jaret Seiberg says not to underestimate the political risk to the likes of Wells, Bank of America (BAC -1.8%), Citigroup (C -1.9%), and JPMorgan (JPM -1.2%). With extra ammunition given to the "break up the banks crowd," this is no longer a negligible risk.Wells Fargo has enjoyed special status compared to the other mega banks since the financial crisis, says Seiberg, but "life [is] about to get worse" for Warren Buffett's favorite. The bank, says Seiberg, will no longer get the benefit of the doubt. "[The] fall from golden child to problem child can be difficult and expensive."The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing on the Wells Fargo matter on Sept. 20.As for the industry as a whole, Treasury Sec. Jack Lew took to the Delivering Alpha conference this morning to wag a finger and say 'I told you so,' to those who complain about Dodd-Frank and over-regulation of banks, in general.

No evidence of WFC problems at other banks
Despite the penalties imposed on Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), there is probably no broader problem in the U.S. banking industry over abusive sales practices, according to the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Regulators fined the company a total of $185M last Thursday, while Moody's warned the episode would negatively affect the bank's debt. Wells paid another $5M to customers for creating more than 2M fake accounts.Related tickers: JPM, C, BAC, MS, USB, COF, FITB, TD, PNC, STI Sep. 13, 2016, 2:09 AM | 32 Comments
Wells Fargo penalty a warning for entire industry
Wells Fargo (WFC -0.7%) yesterday was fined $185M over its employees opening millions of fraudulent deposit and credit card accounts in order to meet sales targets and collect bonuses. The bank has fired 5.3K over improper practices.Over at Rafferty, Dick Bove downgrades Warren Buffett's ([BRK.A]], BRK.B) favorite bank, calling it a "very big problem," that's caused "significant" damage to Wells' business model.While "cross-selling" is something most lenders try to do, Wells Fargo has built its brand around this theme more than its peers. The charges, says Bove, reopens the question about whether customers can trust their banks and to whether another wave of regulation is needed.Compass Point's Isaac Boltansky says the news is "bigger than WFC" and should be viewed as "clear, undeniable warnings" to the entire industry on cross-selling. The bit firmly between its teeth now, look for more enforcement actions from the CFPB.Similar thoughts are hitting the tape from Sandler O'Neill, Evercore ISI, and RBC.Interested parties include: BAC, JPM, C ETFs: KBE, KRE Sep. 9, 2016, 10:37 AM | 135 Comments

WSJ: Banks mull legal challenge to stress tests
The Fed stress tests are the centerpiece of post-crisis bank regulatory reform, and that the banks would even consider challenging a bureaucracy that's not in the habit of being challenged is a shocker. The WSJ, however, reports bank trade groups and industry advisers are debating just that, but say talks are still in an early stage.Fans of Dodd-Frank will naturally argue the stress tests have made the banks far safer, but at what expense to investors? A main area of contention is the opacity of the tests, says the report, as well as the ability of regulators to block returns for subjective reasons (such as challenging them?).Perhaps lenders are feeling their oats following MetLife's successful challenge of its SIFI designation. If the insurer can take on Uncle Sam and win, why not the banks?Interested parties are too numerous to name, but include: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).ETFs: KBE, KRE

Citigroup wins appeal of $800M suit brought by billionaire
Citigroup (NYSE:C) has prevailed in an $800M court action filed by a billionaire accusing it of fraud tied to subprime and toxic mortgages.Arthur Williams -- founder of what would become Primerica Financial Services -- had sued the bank and two CEOs (Charles Prince and Vikram Pandit) because he says he had planned to sell his 17.6M shares in May 2007.When the bank assured investors it was in good shape, he says, he sold just 1M shares instead around the prevailing price of $51.59/share. Two years later he sold the rest of his stake at $3.09/share, and sued for the difference.An appeals court in Manhattan today upheld an October 2013 ruling and said the defendants weren't liable to entities overseen by Williams and his wife. A Citigroup spokeswoman says the bank is pleased with the decision, while Williams' lawyer says their team is considering appeal options. Aug. 5, 2016, 5:37 PM | 9 Comments

Speaking today in Rio de Janeiro, Helio Magalhães, head of Citi's (NYSE:C) Brazil unit. said a formal announcement of at least some sales should come in September.At least in Brazil, Citi has struggled to compete against the largest five banks, which together control nearly 70% of assets in the country's financial system.

Oppenheimer: Bank stock hatred hits new highs
Having covered bank stocks on and off since 1985, the team at Oppenheimer says portfolio managers have never been fans of the sector, but the hatred today is off the charts - even as the reasons for that hatred have gone away.Banks used to be opaque, they overpaid for acquisitions, and often had frothy growth that almost invariably backfired. It's hard to say that today. While banks will always be somewhat opaque, today they're returning capital rather than blowing it on acquisitions, and their "growth initiatives are the epitome of financial probity."Oppenheimer's six large bank composite has on average churned out quarterly pretax earnings of $31.4B per quarter since 2013 (including $30.5B in Q1 this year, and $33.4B in Q2). That's a lot of money, especially since most of it is being used to buy back stock at less than 10x earnings and below tangible book value.While lower-for-longer interest rates will continue to hamper earnings, banks are managing appropriately for the current environment, and the math of buying back stock below book will eventually win the day.Favorite picks are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).ETFs: KBE, KRE Jul. 27, 2016, 11:49 AM | 20 Comments
Citigroup jettisons 69M customers
"Banks are figuring out that providing every product and every service to every client in every country was just wrong," says former Citigroup (NYSE:C) CEO Vikram Pandit, who used to tout his bank's "globality." Prior to the financial crisis, Citi had 268M customers, and today - after selling or shutting down retail operations across the globe, cutting its U.S. branch network by two-thirds, exiting subprime lending, student loans, and life insurance - has lost about 25% of its customers (along with more than 40% of its workforce)."We're not close to being done," says Pandit.Similar changes have taken place at HSBC, which actually had an even larger global footprint than Citigroup. For its part, the bank's been using six "filters" to determine whether it needs to exit certain locations or businesses. Among them are profitability, efficiency, and risk of financial crime.So far, the cuts haven't manifested themselves in increased profitability. ROE at both lenders remains low (8% for C, 7% for HSBC; both were 16% pre-crisis). And it hasn't stifled calls to break up the big banks.Source: Bloomberg's Yalman Onaran Jul. 26, 2016, 1:37 PM | 9 Comments

Bank expense cuts: Only so much meat left on bone
With interest rates continuing to pressure revenues, banks - after years of slashing costs - are coming under renewed pressure to trim even more expenses. But what's left?Source: Dan Freed and Olivia Oran at Reuters The digital revolution has raised hopes for leaner operations, but Bank of America (BAC +0.7%) still spends $1B per year shuffling papers and transporting money in armored trucks. Other costs like mailing paper account statements, replacing lost credit cards, and repairing ATMs haven't gone anywhere either.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - which for years has bragged about technology allowing customers to bank with their smartphones - had to start hiring tellers again due to customer complaints (it's also hiking pay).Count Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) to the above two names as those reporting year-over-year profit declines thanks to the top-line challenges posed by low rates. On the conference call, management faced continued grilling about operating expenses. For its part, Bank of America promised another $3.3B in annual expense cuts.

Wall Street on edge as GOP backs Glass-Steagall
The Republican convention has left Wall Street banks on edge by embracing a proposal to reinstate Glass-Steagall, the banking separation rule which was dropped during the Clinton administration after a bipartisan effort to overturn it.The repeal is often cited as a cause of the financial crisis in 2008, even though two of the institutions at the core of the crisis, Lehman and Bear Stearns, were unaffected by the act's prohibition of combining investment and commercial banks.Related tickers: C, JPM, BAC, WFC, GS Jul. 19, 2016, 3:45 AM | 82 Comments
Citi's "beat" a result of low expectations
The bank earned $1.24 per share in Q2, topping estimates by $0.13, but one year ago, analysts were estimating Citi (NYSE:C) would earn $1.49, reminds John Carney. Just two months ago, consensus was a full $1.26.For full-year 2016, one year ago, analysts were forecasting $5.99, and today the average is $4.53 - a 24% decline which about matches the drop in the share price.Helping the quick cut in Street forecasts over the past few weeks, was CEO Michael Corbat in early June saying he thought Q2 trading revenue would be up only slightly vs. Q1. It ended up rising 12%, though this was likely due to a late-month, post-Brexit flurry of action, rather than Corbat low-balling.After an early rise, the stock has turned lower by 0.7% on today's session.Previously: Citi profit drops, but tops expectations (July 15) Jul. 15, 2016, 11:07 AM | 14 Comments

Banks and insurers cheap for a reason
While nearly all major U.S. banks cruised through the stress tests last month, writes David Schawel, those exams are about determining if lenders have enough capital to get through a crisis, not whether they can earn the sort of risk-adjusted returns of the past.On this front (for insurers as well as banks), there's plenty more for investors to worry about, he says, thanks to the vanishing spread between short rates (what the companies pay on their liabilities), and long rates (what they earn on their assets).A new Fed study finds the adverse effect of weaker net interest margins is materially larger when rates are low. The reason: The lower bound of funding costs is zero as institutions are reticent to charge negative rates.Investors interested in buying banks or insurers because of seemingly cheap valuations might want to look again. Bank multiples, says Schawel, typically move alongside ROE, and serious improvement in ROE is unlikely with rates remaining low.Interested parties include: BAC, C, JPM, WFC, MET, PRU, LNC, PNC, USB, RF, KEY, KRE, KBE Jul. 11, 2016, 3:40 PM | 135 Comments

Rocky credit-card rollout for Costco, Citi
At issue appear to be lengthy wait times and trouble activating accounts for the new Costco Anywhere Visa Card from Citigroup (NYSE:C). The cards became available for use on Monday as Citi took over the Costco (NASDAQ:COST) portfolio from American Express (NYSE:AXP).Costco's sales have slowed of late, with one reason possibly being "friction" from the credit-card switch, says Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.Citi says it's issued 11M cards and had received 1.5M customer calls by late Wednesday, but also says call volumes are returning to normal.Analysts are excited about the potential for lower costs at Costco. Morgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman figures 25% of Costco sales were made with AmEx, which carried a fee of 0.6%, costing the company $180M per year. With Visa, fees should fall to 0.1-0.4%, saving $60M-$150M annually. Jun. 23, 2016, 8:57 AM | 39 Comments

Jefferies' fiscal quarters end one month ahead of those for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), so investors in those banks like to keep an eye out in order to get a preview.What they'll get from Jefferies' FQ2 is that fixed-income trading has experienced a sharp reversal to the upside after a lame Q1. Bond-trading revenue at Jefferies was up 55%, the largest quarterly gain since 2014, and the best Mar-May quarter since 2012. Wall Street executives for a few weeks have touted a Q2 trading rebound, and the news from Jefferies backs that up.On the downside, stock and bond underwriting income continued to slump.

The two are trading at about 1x book and sport ROEs of roughly 10% - both gauges were about twice those amounts prior to the financial crisis.JPMorgan's Kian Abouhossein expects Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and SunTrust (NYSE:STI) to have outsized increases in capital return this year, driven mostly by buybacks.One wild card: This year's tests requires banks to model for negative interest rates.

Citi's sale of Brazilian unit to face tougher regulatory scrutiny
The already-concentrated nature of the local banking industry means any mergers should immediately be deemed "complex," says a member of Brazil's antitrust office.“I am really uncomfortable approving any transaction in the banking industry, especially one made by the nation’s four biggest banks," says Cristiane Alkmin Junqueira Schmidt.Citigroup (NYSE:C) earlier this year put its retail-banking and credit card operations in Brazil on the block, and the nation's top four lenders, including Itau Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB), and Banco Bradesco (NYSE:BBD) would be natural buyers.The antitrust agency yesterday approved Bradesco's purchase of HSBC's Brazilian operation, with the restriction that the bank refrain from additional purchases for 30 months. That deal also required more than the normal review. Jun. 9, 2016, 7:52 AM
Citi warns U.K. on voting for Brexit
The bank employs 9K in the U.K., but said it could look to spread some of that out across the EU in event of a Brexit, according to Reuters, citing an internal memo.Citi's (NYSE:C) attitude echoes that of JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon. who last week said up to 4K of his bank's 16K U.K. jobs could vanish following a Brexit.

Wells Fargo's growth machine sputters
"It's a machine, no doubt about it," says one getting disgruntled customer of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which is one of only two U.S. companies which have produced at least $5B of net income in each of the last 14 quarters (Apple is the other).Worrying analysts though is that customers like the one above - his family has nine Wells products - appear to have had their fill, writes Ben McLannahan in the FT. Wells' lauded cross-sell ratio has fallen from an average of 6.36 products per household in Dec. 2013 to 6.29 a the end of last year."While the bank trades at a premium to U.S. peers in terms of multiple of net assets, that premium has shrunk to half the level of two years ago, and Wells recently cut some financial targets.Without a big rise in interest rates, says Standard Life's Chris Haimendorf, "it is very difficult to see how things can get even better from here."CEO John Stumpf - though acknowledging the low-rate issue - says there are plenty of avenues for growth. He notes peers like BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) closing branches or even pulling out of certain cities. Wells, on the other hand, is keeping its footprint, but adjusting its format with smaller "bodega branches."Stumpf: “All of our new account acquisition happens at one of our branches. If you shut that down, at least today, you shut down your front engine." Jun. 6, 2016, 3:28 PM | 34 Comments
Analyst sees Citi doubling in four years
Massive capital builds (and returns) after 2017 for all of the money-center banks should add four or even five percentage points to EPS growth, says Portales Partners' Charles Peabody, figuring Citigroup (NYSE:C) for  $90 stock by 2020.In the short term, though, energy-related loan losses could be a headwind. Peabody sees reserve builds of up to 15% over the next two years vs. typical provisions of just 5% for the global banks. Jun. 6, 2016, 11:08 AM | 10 Comments

Bank capital requirements to get tougher
In separate public comments today, Fed governors Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell said the Fed will require the eight largest U.S. banks to hold even more capital if they want to pass stress tests.The goal, says Powell, is to make capital requirements so difficult that the largest lenders have to honestly assess whether it would be a better idea to break themselves up.For now, the Fed is going to make 2015's capital surcharges permanent, which alone makes things tougher. "Really quite significant, probably the most significant additional potential capital requirement on the horizon." says former OCC Director John Dugan.The eight: Bank of America (BAC -0.1%), Citigroup (C -0.3%), JPMorgan (JPM -0.4%), Morgan Stanley (MS -0.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC -0.5%), State Street (STT -0.7%), Goldman Sachs (GS -0.7%), BNY Mellon (BK -0.5%) Jun. 2, 2016, 11:24 AM | 107 Comments

Bernstein: CCAR could be incrementally positive
All banks in the team's coverage universe have plenty of room for capital return, says analyst John McDonald, expecting some to have sufficient cushions to be able to move payout ratios (dividends and buybacks) to close to 100% of earnings.Those most likely to have solid increases in payouts are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), PNC FInancial (NYSE:PNC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Those with the least cushion are U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and Regions Financial (NYSE:RF).

Banks up the risk with block trades
About half of all share sales by public companies this year have been block trades, writes Corrie Driebusch, versus an average of about one-third over the past five years, and just one-fifth over the past decade.To review, a block trade involves a bank buying a large chunk of stock from a company or its P-E backers at a discount, in the hopes of unloading it piece-by-piece later that day at a markup.The increase in block trades, of course, comes as business slows at any number of other bank profit centers, particularly fixed-income trading.For the most part, block deals have mostly proved profitable this year, with an average one-day return of 0.5%, according to Dealogic. The leaders in U.S. block trades this year are Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), with Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) also notable participants.

Credit card balances near all-time peak
U.S. credit card balances are on track to climb over $1T this year, closing in on the all-time high of $1.02T set just before things fell completely apart in 2008.Slow, but steady economic growth, an improving job market, and lenders returning to offering credit to millions of subprime consumers are behind the numbers.Lenders will take it where they can get it, as credit cards are one of the few areas working for banks right now, thanks to low margins on ordinary lending and a secular decline in trading profits. For now, delinquency rates are low, and profits are set to rise even more alongside Fed rate hikes.Capital One's (NYSE:COF) strategy to boost card usage by raising spending limits and giving out new cards is paying off: The bank's customers spent 20% more on cards in Q1 this year than last. For Citigroup (NYSE:C), average balances posted their first Y/Y increase since 2008. Balances grew at Discover (NYSE:DFS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) as well.Even American Express (NYSE:AXP), whose customers typically pay it all off every month, is now focusing on lending to those who will keep a balance.Source: The WSJ's Annamaria Andriotis and Robin Sidel May 20, 2016, 9:18 AM | 63 Comments

JPMorgan keeps risk appetite as rivals pull back
Value-at-risk at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) jumped 50% amid Q1's volatility, reports Bloomberg. It's a figure standing in sharp contrast to declines of 25% or more at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Deutshce Bank (NYSE:DB), and smaller falls at UBS, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).For Bank of America, it says the risk in its trading portfolio in Q1 was the lowest in any quarter since the Merrill Lynch merger in 2009.While cutting VaR reduces risk, it also limits profits, and in past times. notes a former Fed bank examiner turned college teacher, banks used episodes of higher volatility to step in and make money. In a Dodd-Frank world, making money in this fashion may not be received well by regulators. May 12, 2016, 12:33 PM | 5 Comments

With fixed-income dead, banks pile into equities
With sharp declines in fixed-income revenue looking less cyclical and more secular with each passing quarter, banks like Citigroup (NYSE:C), UBS, and Deutshce Bank (NYSE:DB) are among those trying to grow their equities business.It sounds like a good idea, but with everyone diving into the same low-margin pool at the same time, that business is likely to come under pressure as well. The newcomers are also fighting against more established players like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)."If everyone tries to grow equities, the economics aren't going to be that great," says analyst Guy Moszkowski. "It's also not going to be easy."Along with razor-thin margins, launching and growing an equities trading business takes a big up-front investment that could take years to bear fruit. Will investors already grappling with low ROEs stand for it?They may have to as it's where the money is.

Goldman team still bullish on big banks
Having had some time to digest weak, but better-than-hoped Q1 results for the nation's largest lenders, Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden remains bullish on the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).He notes NIMs expanded - meaning banks held onto most of the benefit from the Fed's December rate hike. Cost-cutting programs are beginning to bear fruit, with 9% Y/Y cuts in compensation costs, and 3% declines in non-comp expenses.As for energy, provisions made for a 9% drag on EPS, but reserves now stand at 6% of funded energy loans, or 11% of E&P oilfield service loans.Ramsden is looking for robust loan and deposit growth for the rest of this year.His favorite name is Bank of America with a $17 price target (vs. current $14.39). The stock trades at 10.5x 2016 earnings, but probably has the most sensitivity to higher rates, and the most core and non-core expense leverage. Apr. 19, 2016, 1:29 PM | 15 Comments
Citi call: "Sell the furniture and buy back stock"
Taking note of Citigroup's (C +0.8%) tangible book value per share of $62.58 against a stock price in the mid-$40s, and a capital ratio of 12.3%, CLSA's Mike Mayo advices bank management to "sell the furniture and buy back stock."The bank did return $1.5B of capital to shareholders in Q1, including the repurchase of 31M shares (vs. a float of nearly 3B shares). If the "living will" situation is any indicator - Citi was the only one of the large banks not to have its plan deemed unacceptable - Citi might have finally hit the sweet spot with its D.C. regulators and investors can look forward to an accepted CCAR plan this spring.Presentation slidesMore notes from the call: CFO John Gerspach says while March and April have been better than January and February, trading business can't yet be called "robust." He expects trading revenues in Q2 to be flat from Q1.The efficiency ratio went the wrong way - rising to 60% from 54% a year ago, as cost-cutting efforts were overpowered by revenue declines.

JPMorgan's revenues and profits both fell from a year ago, but the lame performance of the banks thus far this year has already priced in a weak quarter. JPMorgan is higher by 3.8%, with Citigroup (C +4.7%), Bank of America (BAC +3.5%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.9%), and Morgan Stanley (MS +4.4%) joining the party. The XLF is higher by 1.75% vs. the S&P 500's 0.7% advance.But what about all of these players (except for Citi) having their living wills rejected by the Fed, FDIC, or both? A sideshow, no doubt.

WSJ: Regulators to reject 'living wills' of some big banks
At least half of the eight U.S. banks labeled "systemically important" are expected to receive "harsh verdicts" regarding their so-called living wills, sending them scrambling to revise plans about how they would handle a potential bankruptcy, WSJ reports.The move, which could come as soon as this week, would raise the prospect of higher capital requirements or other regulatory sanctions for some of the institutions, and underscore fears that the firms remain "too big to fail" without a taxpayer bailout.Related tickers: BK, STT, BAC, JPM, C, GS, MS, WFC Apr. 13, 2016, 4:42 AM | 33 Comments
Banks will face questions on unfunded loans
“Let’s not sugarcoat it, this is not necessarily a loan a bank wants to make at this point,” says Evercore ISI's Glenn Schorr, talking about loans banks have committed to for energy companies, but upon which those firms have not yet drawn.In Q1, energy borrowers announced draws of more than $3B on these loans, saddling banks with maybe more exposure to the sector than they or their investors would like right now.Citigroup (NYSE:C), for example, has about $20B in funded energy loan exposure, but commitments for nearly another $40B. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has loans of just over $20B and commitments for another $20B-plus. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) are showing similar stories (though mostly smaller amounts). Add it up, and there's $147B of unfunded loans disclosed by the ten of the largest U.S. banks.

Big bank breakups ... Some, more than others
Focusing on "too big to fail" is too narrow a lens with which to analyze and make decisions about bank size and concentration, says the team at KBW, taking note of increased chatter of late about a forced breakup of the nation's largest lenders.Returns are part of the mix too, and if they're poor at the mega-banks, this limits credit creation in the economy - a signal, says KBW, that companies must "radically restructure" to get their stock prices above at least tangible book value.Looking at the stock prices of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) during the past five years, KBW says Wells has traded above TBV throughout the time period - suggesting the bank is consistently creating returns above its cost of capital. Citi, on the other hand, has not traded above TBV for the whole period - "a clear market signal that the company should consider much more radical restructuring to create profitable business that can grow."

Going back another ten years, the average tenure was 30 months.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) are among the banks altering age-old traditions for young bankers - crazy-long hours of drudgery, slow advancement - to better suit the attitudes of this particular generation of worker bees.“We’re focused on trying to understand what’s important to the folks we hire right out of school,” says John Waldron, co-head of investment banking at Goldman."Every day I can see the direct result of my action," says an ex-employee of Moelis (NYSE:MC), who gave up all-nighters preparing pitch books for the boutique investment bank to instead work for a mobile-gaming startup.

JP Morgan and Citi are Credit Suisse's 2 top big-bank picks
Credit Suisse switches its top big-bank picks, moving JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) to first spot, and Citigroup (NYSE:C) out of first into second.JPM: Target $75. Implied upside 28%. "2015 was no easy year; JPM maneuvered through just fine posting above average revenue growth and returns. Results were all the more impressive coupled with targeted and achieved G-SIB surcharge reductions. Sustained share price outperformance relies on continued above average ROE generation."C: Target $55. Implied upside 32%. "Citi is a value play in U.S. banks sector, trading at 0.7x TBV (vs 1.2x peers; vs Citi’s financial crisis trough of 0.4x – the latter being a unique time; a good bit of regulatory change ought to protect from a return to those scenarios) and has declined 18% YTD (vs -13%) on deteriorating EM and macro backdrop."Now read Sell The Banks: The Invisible Hand Is Broken » Apr. 8, 2016, 4:53 AM | 4 Comments
Higher rates? Wait 'till next year
The 10-year Treasury yield at 1.69% has returned back to levels not seen since the panicky action in mid-February. And while the Fed has marked down its expectation of rate hikes this year to just two, short-term interest rate markets haven't even priced in one.This leaves those whose business model depends on riding the yield curve having to contend with not only a middling macro picture, but - once again - a rates lower for longer picture (although Jamie Dimon says his big fear is that markets aren't pricing in nearly enough in the way of higher rates).Citigroup (C -4.1%), Bank of America (BAC -3.3%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -2.8%), KeyCorp (KEY -3.4%), Regions Financial (RF -3.4%), BNY Mellon (BK -3.6%), E*Trade (ETFC -4.7%), Manulife (MFC -5.2%), Lincoln National (LNC -3.6%) Apr. 7, 2016, 3:09 PM | 13 Comments
Big banks: The CCAR submissions are in
"We are confident in the capital strength of the large and mid-cap banks - and with that, their capacity for increased capital returns," says Credit Suisse's Susan Roth Katzke.Stronger balance sheets, she says, should outweigh what is a harsher adverse scenario from the Fed.Roth and team see a total net capital return increase of 77% vs. 58% in 2015, with a median payout ratio of 31% vs. 27%. Incremental dollars should be skewed to buybacks given cheap stock valuations and the Fed's preference for the flexibility afforded by repurchases.Best positioned for the highest capital return are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).The highest incremental capital returns should come from Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).The lower end of payout ratios should fall on Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) and Bank of America.Now read: Sell The Banks: The Invisible Hand Is Broken (April 4) Apr. 7, 2016, 12:44 PM | 12 Comments

Citi tops AmEx on rewards
The reward terms for Citigroup's (C -0.3%) new Costco (COST +1.3%) card (coming in May and to be named Costco Anywhere) are considerably better than what American Express (AXP -0.7%) offered, including 4% cash back on up to $7K of gasoline purchases per year (AmEx offered 3% on up to $4K).Citi's Costco card will also give 3% cash back on restaurant purchases vs. 2% from AmEx.AmEx, of course, could start offering more generous rewards, but they don't come free, and - unlike competitors - AmEx can't make the money back from interest on balances.Calling Citi's Costco Anywhere card "significantly more appealing" than AmEx's offering, Credit Suisse expects the Citi/Costco partnership to "aggressively pursue increased Costco membership, dominate in-store spending, and generate significant spending outside the store."

Bloomberg: Inside look at Wall Street's secret client list
"If you're not inside, you're outside," famously said Gordon Gekko.At the top of a secret list at Citigroup (NYSE:C) is the "Focus Five" - a group of hedge funds that bring in big dollars to the bank: Millennium, Citadel, Surveyor Capital, Point72, and Carlson Capital. These lucrative clients get the best service - top trade ideas, hours-long phone calls with analysts, intimate get-togethers with executives, bespoke trading models, and more.It's part of a new model on Wall Street, with banks backing off the "we-do-everything" model to cater to those select few who generate the most revenue. Players like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and HSBC are joining Citigroup in focusing on this 1% of the 1%.“It’s a rude awakening when you find out that research isn’t readily available," says Jeff Sica, who manages "only" about $1.5B.Smaller banks too. Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) has a "Blackjack" list of its top 21 clients, through CEO Ron Kruszewski says it's not currently in use.In today's world, banks have little choice. Hamstrung by the new regulatory environment, barely visible rates, and a lame trading environment, using gates to research to encourage more business is a rare avenue of revenue growth.ETFs: IAI, KCE

Bond market thaw as Citigroup and Goldman unload BioMed deal debt
Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were able to clear their books of about $1.8B of debt backed by Blackstone's purchase of BioMed Realty Trust. There was strong demand for the offering, inline with what one might expect given the strong rally in risk assets over the past six weeks.There's also a "flight-to-quality" thanks to Blackstone's track record as a borrower.Wall Street banks funded a full $14B of real estate buyouts last year - that fast pace combined with the market troubles early this year led to serious congestion on their balance sheets, and the spread between CMBS and Treasurys jumped to nearly three percentage points earlier this year from about one-and-a-half a year ago. That spread has narrowed to 240 basis points since the rally began in mid-February. Mar. 22, 2016, 2:42 PM
RBC: Low rates could force breakup of big banks
Return on average common equity (ROACE) is what determines the valuation of large, mature banks, says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, and those banks that cannot earn their cost of equity capital - estimated at 9-10% through the cycle - ought to consider alternative strategies, including breaking up.The key here is interest rates, and should they remain at these levels for a prolonged period, reaching targeted ROACE will be difficult for all banks, particularly for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).While a sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates value could be unlocked, the cost of doing so could be prohibitive, says Cassidy.Long-term investors planning on holding through the cycle are better off with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), but active investors managing their portfolios more aggressively might consider BofA and Citi.

KBW: Citi should break up
"One of the primary benefits of becoming smaller is escaping the vise that is the current regulatory environment,” says the team at KBW, suggesting a three-step process to breaking up the bank: 1) Sell the international consumer business, excluding Mexcio; 2) Sell the Mexico business; 3) Split what's left into a U.S. consumer business and a global corporate bank.The moves, says KBW, would deliver an estimated market value of $198B, or 57% more than investors currently value Citigroup (C)."The rules and capital requirements are so high that these banks cannot earn an acceptable return for shareholders, nor can they in some cases earn their cost of capital,” KBW CEO Tom Michaud tells Bloomberg.

"Our overall Q1 results reflect an exceptionally volatile and turbulent market environment during our first fiscal quarter," says Jefferies (NYSE:LUK) CEO Richard Handler. "A quiet December was followed by an extremely challenging January and first few weeks of February."The investment bank posted a loss of $166.8M in Q1 vs. a profit of $12.9M a year ago. Revenue of $299M fell a full 49%, led by an 82% plunge in trading revenue to $58.8M. Of this, fixed-income revenue fell to $56.8M from $126M. Equity trading revenue fell to just $1.7M from $203.5M thanks to markdowns on two equity block trades.Good times ahead: Not only have markets stabilized, says management, they've "aggressively snapped back" in the early part of Q2.Coming one month ahead of the rest of the Wall Street banks, Jefferies results are often seen as a bellwether of what to expect.

Bloomberg: Wall Street wants a piece of BlackRock
While the big Wall Street banks are struggling with slides in fixed-income revenues, business is booming at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and other ETF providers offering credit-related products.The banks, writes Lisa Abramowicz, want some of that business back.The issue for banks are new regulatory and capital rules which make it harder to hold big inventories are paper investors want to trade. Meanwhile, the ease of moving in and out of vehicles like BlackRock's $25B IG bond fund (NYSEARCA:LQD) or its $16B junk-bond fund (NYSEARCA:HYG) have led to surging volumes, even as the individual securities underlying those ETFs are more difficult to trade.Banks are responding with the total-return swap in which an investor pays a fee to a counterparty who promises delivery of the total gain on a basket of certain debt. These instruments are not only quickly traded without having to deal with the underlying securities, but are pegged to some of the same indexes as the biggest credit ETFs. Citigroup (NYSE:C) just became the eight dealer in these derivatives (joining GS, BAC, JPM, MS, CS, DB and OTCQX:BNPQY), which are being pitched by banks as an alternative to ETFs.

Gross: Epic era of credit expansion ending
The global economy has been powered by credit for more than 40 years, says Bill Gross - noting official credit outstanding today of $58T is 58x that of 1970. That expansion, though, looks to be ending, as private sector savers are growing leery, and regulators build fences against fast creation. And don't forget the meager returns, with negative interest rates in 40% of Euroland, and out ten years on the curve in Japan.The collapse in bank stocks globally isn't necessarily about energy losses. Price charts since 2007 for players like Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suggest the sector's either a screaming cheap buy, or "a permanently damaged victim of writes-offs, tighter regulation, and significantly lower futures margins. I'll vote for the latter."Then there's insurers, whose business models - which depend on 7-8% returns from risk assets - are at risk. They're not going bankrupt, but future profitability for companies like MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU), and Hartford (NYSE:HIG) will be stifled as claims can't be covered as easily when investment returns are so lame.The same goes or pension funds, and Puerto Rico is going down Detroit's path not just because of overpromised benefits, but because they're not earning enough on their investment portfolios to cover those promises.Central bankers, meanwhile, think they can solve things by cutting rates just a bit further.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, SEF, FNCL, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, FINZ, XLFS Mar. 3, 2016, 8:37 AM | 35 Comments

Heard on the Street: Banks caught in ugly cycle
It's another nasty session for banks today, writes David Reilly, and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is now lower by almost 20% YTD, with names like Citigroup (C -2.3%) and Bank of America (BAC -2.3%) down nearly 30%.The nasty feedback cycle begins with the crash in the oil price, which stings banks thanks to worries of big losses on energy-lending, and more broadly hurts lenders by dragging down the stocks in general. This in turn, leads to concern about a recession would further ding bank profits.More ominous, the yield curve is flattening. Using the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes isn't a bad proxy for bank profits and it's slumped to just 0.96% today. Old-timers will remember when this spread used to turn negative - a sure sign of looming recession.The good news, says Reilly, is that the energy crash and low rates don't look to cause the sorts of losses seen in 2008. Take the long view - the cycle will someday turn.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, KRE, UYG, VFH, KBE, IYF, BTO, IAT, IYG, SEF, FNCL, FXO, KBWB, QABA, RYF, FINU, KBWR, KRU, RWW, FINZ, KRS, XLFS Feb. 24, 2016, 1:13 PM | 35 Comments
Banks lower as JPMorgan warns on energy
Holding its investor day today, JPMorgan said it was going to add another $500M to energy-related loan-loss reserves. This followed a $67M provision in Q4, which at the time brought total oil and gas loss reserves to $815M (vs. a portfolio with book value of $44B).In addition, the bank said it could need to add another $1.5B to reserves should oil hang around $25 per barrel over the next 18 months. For perspective, prior to Q4, JPMorgan hadn't had to add to reserves for six years - in fact reserve releases were a big boost to profits across the industry."When the biggest bank increases reserves for potential oil losses it sets a tone for the industry,” says Mike Mayo.Separately, the FDIC says bad loan provisions across the banking sector were $3.8B higher in Q4 than a year earlier.JPMorgan (JPM -3.5%), Citigroup (C -2.9%), Bank of America (BAC -2.9%), Wells Fargo (WFC -2%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -3%), Regions Financial (RF -3.8%), Comerica (CMA -4.2%), Zions (ZION -4.1%), PNC Financial (PNC -2%).ETFs: KRE, KBE, IAT, KBWB, QABA, KBWR, KRU, KRS Feb. 23, 2016, 2:38 PM | 56 Comments

Bloomberg: Citi to exit retail operations in Brazil and Argentina
The plan to get out retail banking in those countries will probably be announced in the coming weeks, according to Bloomberg's source, and the bank won't be exiting any institutional businesses there.Citigroup (C -2%) operates in 25 cities in Argentina and 26 in Brazil.The move shouldn't be a surprise as Ciit has been getting out of consumer banking in those countries across the globe where it doesn't have a big enough presence to be a competitive player.

WSJ: Bank-stock rout tramples bonuses
Just at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), employees have taken $400M in paper losses on their restricted stock paid out as bonus last year, according to the WSJ.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BofA (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) haven't yet reported 2015 stock grants, but their share prices have been similarly hit.Should slumping stock prices persist, it could add to the leakage of talent from Wall Street to tech and other industries, as bankers will be leaving a lot less money on the table.The issue is a test for new Dodd-Frank rules which forced banks to tailor incentive packages towards rewarding long-term health, rather than short-term profits. The result: Banks are now more likely to award restricted shares which don't vest for several years. Feb. 18, 2016, 9:08 AM | 36 Comments
BMO: Six lenders to buy on the dip
The team sees 120% upside by year-end for the battered (off 50% YTD) OneMain Financial (OMF +5.2%). Look past the subprime lender's high leverage, they say, and value the stock on a forward P/E basis.Investors will grow to appreciate Ted Pick's efforts to shrink low-multiple businesses, says BMO, seeing 104% upside for Morgan Stanley (MS +2.7%). This is a re-rating story, and will thus take more time to play out than, for instance, OneMain.Capital One (COF +3.2%), they say, is a fast-growing regional bank being valued as if it were still a specialty monoline credit card lender. "A re-rating is long overdue.""Faster-than-expected growth in regulatory capital (from the synergistic combination of litigation normalization and utilization of deferred tax assets) should allow for significant growth in Citigroup's (C +4%) dividend and share repurchases."Buy Synchrony Financial (SYF +2.8%) ahead of what should be the commencement of capital returns in in H2.MasterCard (MA +1.5%) has seen marked underperformance relative to Visa of late - this despite an historical 85% correlation. In the medium-term, look for higher-than-expected buybacks, and in the long-term, faster market share growth than Visa and AmEx in China. Feb. 16, 2016, 3:17 PM | 4 Comments
New Fed member suggests breaking up the big banks
Former Goldmanite and TARP czar, and now Minneapolis Fed President, Neil Kashkari says the time is right for Congress to go further than Dodd-Frank "with bold, transformational solutions to solve [too big to fail] once and for all."Lawmakers, he says, should break up the largest banks into "smaller, less connected, less important entities." Other options would be turning the large lenders into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they can't fail, or taxing leverage throughout the financial system.Watching with interest: BAC, C, JPM, WFC, MS, GS Feb. 16, 2016, 11:07 AM | 151 Comments

Deutsche Bank at record low as fear over European banks grows
It is the European banks and contagion concerns that are freaking out the markets today - not just the Fed, China and crude oil - according to David Rosenberg, noting that some of the European banks are trading at 2008 crisis levels after the group has tumbled 18% YTD vs. 11% for the STOXX 600 index.European financial firms are taking a beating amid fears of "a chronic profitability crisis that makes it impossible for banks to build up barely-adequate capital bases," WSJ reports.Deutsche Bank (DB -9.8%) is down another ~10%, bringing its YTD loss to nearly 40% while its valuation has fallen to ~30% of book value, and its credit default swaps spiked to their highest levels since 2012.News of major withdrawals out of Credit Suisse (CS -4.2%) caused its shares to sink 11% last week, hitting a 24-year low, and Santander (SAN -6.2%), BBVA (BBVA -5.4%), and UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFF -5.5%) are down to lows seen during the last eurozone financial crisis."Oil and the flatter yield curve alone do not explain the 12% plunge we have seen in S&P Financials so far this year," Rosenberg says, adding that BofA (BAC -6.1%), Citigroup (C -6.2%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -3.5%) all briefly touched 52-week lows last week - "an ominous signpost."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, PSP, IYF, EUFN, BTO, IPF, IAI, IYG, SEF, FNCL, FXO, PFI, IXG, PEX, RYF, FINU, KCE, RWW, KBWC Earlier: Markets extend two-day rout; gold gets 3% boost Feb. 8, 2016, 2:24 PM | 36 Comments

Time to bet on big U.S. banks - Barron’s
Barron’s says it’s a good time to bet on the big banks after a rocky start to the year.The 10 biggest U.S. banks are trading for 8x-12x 2016 estimated earnings; the S&P 500 trades at 16x.Exposure to distressed U.S. energy companies is manageable.While leading Democratic presidential candidates are pushing for a breakup of the biggest banks, that possible eventuality could be a positive since many trade below their sum-of-parts.The following banks all have 20% upside: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), PNC (NYSE:PNC), Suntrust (NYSE:STI), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).

A kind word for roughed-up banks
"The market is clearly saying that Citigroup (NYSE:C) is worth far more dead than alive," says fund manager Colin McWey, an owner of the stock, but scratching his head at its valuation of just two-thirds of tangible book value.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) trade for right around book value.Bank valuations are so cheap right now, says Morningstar's Jim Sinegal, that not a lot has to go right for an investor to make money.What about energy? Is it the new subprime? First off, writes Michael Brush, exposure isn't that high. At JPMorgan, it's about 1.6% of total loans; at Citi it's 3.3%. Energy loans make up just 1.8% of total loans at the roughly 15 lenders in Baird analyst David George's coverage universe vs. 25% exposure to housing sector debt.

Headline doesn't tell the tale of Citi results; stock down 5.4%
Citigroup (C -5.4%) beat headline estimates, but Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski - a bull on the stock - says it's nearly impossible to figure out the "true" operating earnings thanks to a large number of one-time items, and the bank's weak job in providing detail.We do know profit at Citi Holdings soared to $704M from $87M a year ago thanks to, among other things, the sale of OneMain Financial. Income at the Global Consumer Banking unit, however, fell 20%, and at the Institutional Clients Group by 18%.His bottom line: “It strikes us that the general picture is that consumer banking revenues were somewhat weaker than expected, but importantly that all the credit metrics, both domestically and abroad, were stable at excellent levels.”Nomura's Steven Chubak calls the results "disappointing," citing the above numbers at GCB and ICG. He expects the stock to continue to underperform.Back out the sales of Citi Holdings assets, says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, and Q4 missed by plenty.Earnings call slide deckIt's a rough day for the markets in general, but Citi's loss today is about double that of the other TBTFs.Previously: Surge in income at Citi Holdings boosts Citigroup to earnings beat (Jan. 15) Jan. 15, 2016, 10:43 AM | 24 Comments

How many bank jobs vanished since the financial crisis?
Announced cuts in the fourth quarter totaled at least 47K, following 52K lost jobs in the first nine months of 2015. That would would put the aggregate figure since 2008 at about 600K, according to Bloomberg.Staff reductions at some of the world's biggest banks are still far from over. Notables: Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) plans to slash 26K positions by 2018, UniCredit (OTC:UNCFY) will eliminate about 18,200 positions, and Citigroup (NYSE:C) plans to eliminate at least 2,000 more jobs next year.

Bloomberg: Citi to cut 2K jobs in January
A big chunk of those jobs will be in middle or back-office positions, reports Bloomberg, and come as the bank continues restructuring work.For perspective, Citigroup (C -2.5%) has 239K workers globally, and had 374K prior to the financial crisis.Earlier this month, CFO John Gerspach told an investor conference the bank would take a roughly $300M Q4 charge as it "resize(ed) its infrastructure" to deal with reality of today's banking environment.That $300M charge compares to a $655M similar expense from Q4 in 2014. For all 2015, restructuring charges will total $458M, the lowest since 2010. Dec. 18, 2015, 3:07 PM | 9 Comments

Trading revenue typically declines sequentially in Q4, and Citigroup (C -0.4%) CFO John Gerspach - presenting at an investor conference - expects a 15-20% fall this year.More important is how the results look on a year-over-year basis, and Gerspach demurred on that point, though noting he's trying to put 2014 out of his mind - trading revenue fell 14% after the bank had earlier predicted just a 5% decline.How this year's Q4 ultimately plays out may be determined by the market reaction to the Fed's expected rate hike next week, says Gerspach.WebcastPreviously: BofA expects inline decline in fixed-income trading in Q4 (Dec. 9) Dec. 9, 2015, 11:28 AM | 1 Comment

Citigroup reportedly to fall under ECB supervision
At issue is a move to simplify the legal structure of the bank's operations in Europe by combining Dublin's Citibank Europe and the U.K.'s Citibank International. The two together would breach the €30B in assets (they have €57B), thus forcing the combo under direct ECB supervision.The central bank would then have a say in board and senior management appointments, and might also subject the lender to stress tests.

Fed review finds shortcomings in its handling of stress tests
Key to the issues are the computer models the central bank uses to simulate how banks might perform during a recession. The results spewed out by these programs effectively determine the level of dividends and buybacks of the nation's large banks (not to mention the career path of bank managers).Source: WSJ Internal reviews found shortcomings in the Fed's system for double-checking the models - too few staff, too heavy reliance on certain key personnel, and lacking clear procedures and policies about certain aspects of the validation process. “Similar findings identified at institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve have typically been characterized as matters requiring immediate attention," according to the report.In response, the Fed has done what most bureaucracies do - hired more staff and created a supervisory committee. Nevertheless, the findings of the reviews are likely to add fuel to calls from bankers and lawmakers for the central bank to open up the "black box" of its stress-testing models.Among the interested parties are Citigroup (NYSE:C), which failed a stress test, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - all of whom have had their issues.

Banks stay in commodities, but lower risk
So-called inventory-financing deals - otherwise known as traditional banking - are on the rise. We're replacing market risk with credit risk, says Goldman's (NYSE:GS) Gregory Agran, global-co-head of commodity trading.Whereas before Goldman and others might have had a relatively small group placing wagers on the direction of commodities, they now have a far larger group working on making loans. It makes for a sizable drop in profit margins - these new deals have returns as low as 2 % - but doesn't run afoul of new bank regulations.Joining Goldman in moving to expand inventory-financing are JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

Regulators set out new rules for SIFIs
The Financial Stability Board has published new rules that aim to stop banks from becoming "too big to fail," confirming its final proposals for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, or TLAC.Under the plan, large lenders will have by January 2019 to hold a financial cushion of at least 16% of their risk-weighted assets in equity and debt that can be written off. That requirement will gradually increase, reaching 18% of assets weighted by risk by January 2022.The FSB will put the rules, which will apply to the world's top 30 banks, to the G20 later this month.

AIG may be activist target, but forget about the big banks
With Carl Icahn's targeting of AIG, activists are clearly climbing higher on the financial-services food chain, writes David Reilly. The goal is to make the companies small enough to not be subject to the sorts of stringent D.C. regulations associated with being too-big-to-fail.A case in point is CIT Group, which last week announced the departure of John Thain and a plan to sell certain units. Thain's goal had been just the opposite - to turn CIT into a TBTF.The biggest of the big won't be quaking in their boots, says Reilly, noting the typical tools of the activist - boosting capital returns or levering up - would be dead on arrival in Washington. As much as investors would like to see Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) broken up in order to realize value - they haven't traded above book value in seven years - it's not going to happen this way.Previously: Carl Icahn targets AIG (Oct. 28)Previously: CIT Group soars after strategic shakeup (Oct. 22) Oct. 28, 2015, 12:42 PM | 2 Comments

Notes from Citi's earnings call
Speaking to the media ahead of the investor call Citigroup (C +2%) CFO John Gerspach says trading activity is up early in Q4, but still running at muted levels - Markets and Securities services revenue fell 5% Y/Y in Q3, led by fixed income's 16% decline.Despite a 25% decline in revenue at the investment banking unit, Gerspach says he feels good about Citi's M&A franchise. Advisory revenue fell 24%, debt underwriting dropped 17%, and equity underwriting tumbled 43%.The revamp of the credit-card division is a long-term project, says Gerspach on the investor call, and will probably take up to two years. Q3 card revenue fell 9% Y/Y to $1.93B. Credit card loans fell 3% to $64.8B. Gerspach hopes those balances start to increase early next year.WSJ's MoneybeatPresentation slidesPreviously: Citigroup gains after earnings beat (Oct. 15)Previously: Citigroup beats by $0.03, misses on revenue (Oct. 15) Oct. 15, 2015, 10:18 AM

Morgan Stanley warns of earnings misses for big banks
The Street has priced in earnings declines for pretty much every sector, but Q3 and Q4 estimates for the financials have barely budged, and consensus sees Q3 results 10% above that of a year ago.Morgan Stanley's Huw van Steenis, however, sees FICC revenue declines of 10-25% - far more than the 5% or so that's been talked about by bank managements at recent investor conferences - as the commodity price crash combines with collapsing fixed-income trading, and the lack of volatility in forex action.With just $20B in FICC revenues, says van Steenis, Q3 is shaping up to be the second worst quarter for banks in the last two years. Leaving his own bank (NYSE:MS) out of the analysis, he sees FICC revenue declines of 17% at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), 9% at Goldman (NYSE:GS), and 6% at BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citi (NYSE:C).Bottom line: "On EPS, we are 4% below consensus on average across our coverage for 2015, and 5% below for 2016. The biggest delta is for Barclays (NYSE:BCS), BNP Paribas (OTCQX:BNPQY), and Goldman in 2015, and SocGen (OTCPK:SCGLY), HSBC, and BNP in 2016."Source: ZeroHedge Oct. 5, 2015, 3:31 PM | 12 Comments

Bloomberg: JPMorgan to pay most in $1.86B CDS settlement
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) will pay almost a third of a $1.86B settlement to resolve accusations that a dozen big banks conspired to limit competition in the credit default swaps market, Bloomberg reports.JPM reportedly will pay $595M, followed by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) with $230M, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) at $175M, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) at $164M, Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) at $160M and Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) at $120M; BofA (NYSE:BAC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPZY), UBS, Citigroup (NYSE:C), Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) and HSBC would pay less than $100M each.The deal would avert a trial and end years of litigation by hedge funds, pension funds, university endowments, small banks and other investors, who sued as a group.

Guggenheim boosts M&A outlook
Merger-and-acquisition volume in 2016-17 should be $3.3T-$4.5T, says Guggenheim, up from its previous forecast of $2.7T-$4.5T. The current drivers of M&A are likely to remain in place; macroeconomic conditions may remain uneven; and several specific factors may compel consolidation in certain industries. Health care, media, and telecom activity has been robust, and should stay so. Activity in energy should increase, but banking M&A should stay subdued.The winners? U.S. bulge bracket and boutique firms have gained market share at the expense of European and other non-U.S. companies. Showing the most market share gains is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), followed by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Goldman remains Guggenheim's Best Idea, and BofA and Ciit remain buys, partly thanks to the M&A thesis. Sep. 16, 2015, 12:39 PM | 1 Comment

Citi's "bad bank" gets better
This just in: Ciit Holdings - the "bad bank" set up as a holding cell for toxic loans and businesses Citigroup (NYSE:C) wanted to get rid of - has posted four consecutive profitable quarters. The unit has also disposed of more than $700B in assets over the years."We're out of the dark tunnel," says Citi Holdings boss Francesco Vanni d’Archirafi. "If we said four years ago Citi Holdings is going to be consistently profitable, there’s no way that would have been believed," says UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. Overall since being set up, Citi Holdings has lost about $60B.The unit's still a pretty big one - with $116B in assets it would rank in the top 30 of U.S. banks - but other than OneMain Financial, the rest of what's left could be harder to unload (and even the OneMain sale is being held up). "What you get to at the end is the rock pile," says analyst Marty Mosby.“The best example of success,” says Vanni d’Archirafi, “will be when people stop talking about Citi Holdings.”Source: WSJ Aug. 13, 2015, 8:46 AM | 4 Comments

Bove makes bull case for banks
With Q2 results for the nation's largest banks now all in, Dick Bove says the key takeaway is operating earnings - which eliminates taxes, and the impact from loan losses and reserve releases - are not just growing, they're jumping. By his calculation, the operating earnings for BAC, C, JPM, and WFC are up 23% for the last twelve months compared to the previous period.Asset quality is far better nowadays as well, he says, noting the new regulatory regime has forced lenders to hold a higher amount of government-guaranteed paper on their books. "The addition of capital, cash, and government-backed securities means that the book value of these companies is very real. Yet, at least two of the big banks sell at a discount to this value."More bullish points: The most onerous and costly of the new regulations are already out there, litigation - while continuing - won't be nearly as expensive going forward, M&A is on the rise, and trading activity is coming back.Most importantly, says Bove, is that investment psychology is shifting. "The attitude that banks are utilities that can never show earnings gains is disappearing. The view that bank asset values are overstated is gone or should be gone. The view that the government has multiple new ways to attack these companies is also disappearing."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF, FINZ Jul. 20, 2015, 12:45 PM | 18 Comments

"Asia will grow disproportionately to the rest of the world," says Jonathan Larsen - global head of retail banking for Citi (NYSE:C), and head of consumer banking for Asia Pacific - who aims to double to 1M the number of wealth-management clients in Asia in the next five years.Current numbers: Citi's Asian consumer bank accounted for 21% of global consumer-banking revenue in Q1. Asia revenue from consumer banking of $7.5B was 51% of total Asia revenue in 2014.Larsen will focus on those customers with investible assets between $100K and $1M, and total assets of $1M-$10M.Of the competition from so-called robo advising, Larsen notes clients working across multiple currencies and investing in assets like real estate are going to need a wealth manager, not a robo adviser.Source: WSJ Jun. 24, 2015, 9:16 AM | 2 Comments

Banks fines: How much and where have they gone?
More than seven years after the global financial collapse, regulators and investors are still working through a mile-high pile of lawsuits and other civil actions, and it seems like the fines keep on coming.Since the crisis, banks and other institutions have paid more than $150B in fines, settlements and other penalties, according to a tally by FT. That compares with the roughly $700B in profits generated by U.S. banks between 2007 and 2014.So where have all the payments gone? The biggest have landed in the Justice Department, which has collected some $50B. Other heavy collectors include the FHFA, Fannie Mae, HUD and the SEC.Among the banks paying the biggest amounts, BofA (NYSE:BAC) tops the list - with nearly $58B, followed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ($31.3B), Citigroup (NYSE:C) ($12.8B) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) ($9.7B).

In the sort of things dreams are made of for retailers, Costco's (COST -1.7%) new deal with Visa (V -1.6%) and Citigroup (C -1.6%) will have the company paying next to nothing for transactions vs. the roughly 0.6% it pays current partner American Express (AXP -4.2%)."The numbers didn't add up," said AmEx CEO Ken Chenault last month when telling his shareholders why the company let the Costco relationship go. "We couldn't accept their financial terms."For Citigroup, it's plan is to make money by customers carrying loan balances, and for Visa it hopes to earn when customers use those cards at other retailers where fees are higher. Banks generally make about 80% of their credit card revenue from interest balances and other fees, with interchange making up the rest, according to Bernstein's Lisa Ellis.To put some numbers on it, Costco had about $100B in sales last year, with its customers accounting for 20% of AmEx's loans and 8% of spending.

Citigroup (C +1.8%) beat Q1 estimates on the bottom line, writes Maureen Farrell, despite a reserve release that was less than some had expected. KBW, for one, expected a release of $325M for the Q, but Citi only released $202M.Asked about the crash in the oil price, CFO John Gerspach isn't worried, noting commodities is a small part of the bank's overall business and performed well during Q1. Deterioration in the oil & gas companies Citi work with has been only "minor."Citigroup is "the big turnaround story for the large-cap banks," says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, noting Citi delivered on lower expenses.

Citi has since been suspended from conduction capital market operations and its CEO in the country stripped of his authority.Source: Reuters

Justice wants guilty plea from Citibank in forex probe
While the DOJ wants Citigroup's (NYSE:C) main banking subsidiary - Citibank - to plead guilty, reports Bloomberg, Citi has countered, offering that plea from a smaller unit.An agreement could come as soon as next month, and is likely to include a fine of nearly $1B.At issue for Citi: A guilty plea from Ciitbank might hinder its ability to operate certain types of businesses (Citibank accounted for 70% of Citigroup revenue in 2014). The DOJ, on the other hand, wants guilty pleas from important entities within banks, and one from Citibank would be a rather large scalp to hang on the wall at DOJ headquarters.

FICO readies new credit scoring system
Looking for some kind of growth wherever they can find it, banks are about to get their wish as Fair Isaac is set to launch a new credit scoring metric which should expand by tens of millions the field of those eligible to get credit.The new score will pull payment histories for things like utilities to calculate credit scores for consumers who might otherwise not have one. Other things - like how often someone changes address - will be used to help calculate a score.FICO and 10 unnamed credit card issuers have been testing the new score since November, and Fair Isaac intends to roll things out nationwide by year-end. Right now, about 15M of the 53M previously unscorable Americans can be scored using the new system.Source: WSJ Among those of interest: WFC, C, BAC, JPM, COF, DFS, AXP ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, FINZ, KRS Apr. 1, 2015, 4:33 PM | 16 Comments

Pleasant surprise may be in store in bank earnings in April
The big banks have had a rough start to the year, but surging trading volume in bonds, currencies, and commodities in Q1 could make for pleasant surprises when the lenders report quarterly results next month, writes John Carney.The average daily trading volume across all U.S. bonds was up 10.6% Y/Y through the end of February, according to Sifma, with trading in corporate bonds up 18.1%, driven by a big rise in issuance. Trading in Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie MBS was up 35.3% from a year ago.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) could be a particular beneficiary, as about 25% of its revenue is generated by FICC, and Credit Suisse sees the bank posting its first year-over-year increase in that unit's revenue since 2009.Others of interest: Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, KCE, RWW, RYF, KBWC, FINZ Mar. 26, 2015, 4:37 PM | 5 Comments
Bloomberg: Big changes mulled for China's securities industry
In what could be a big boon for overseas banks doing business in China, Beijing is mulling sweeping changes for the securities industry which would include allowing foreign banks controlling stakes in their local joint ventures, reports Bloomberg.The looser restrictions would let players like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) compete more effectively with dominant incumbents like Citic Securities.Current rules approved in 2012 allow overseas banks to just 49% ownership of securities firms.

In the latest twist to the showdown between Argentina and Citigroup (NYSE:C), a U.S. federal court has agreed to allow Citi to make interest payments to investors holding $2.3B of Argentine bonds at the end of this month and on June 30.Previously, U.S. Judge Thomas Griesa ruled that Argentina must settle with its holdout hedge funds before it continues paying interest to the majority of investors who accepted debt writedowns following the country's $100B default in 2002.Previously: Citigroup, Argentina face off; Citi slashes CEO pay (Mar. 19 2015) Mar. 23, 2015, 2:21 AM | 2 Comments
Citigroup annual report: Banamex, stress test behind Corbat pay cut
Citigroup (C -2.6%) last month disclosed CEO Michael Corbat's total pay of $13M for 2014, down from $14.5M the previous year. Behind the pay cut were the bank's failure to have its capital return plan approved by the Fed, and the fraud-related issues at Banamex, says the bank in its annual report.2015 is looking better as Citi passed the CCAR with ease and Banamex fades further into the past.From the CEO's letter: "Citi is not the bank that entered, endured, or emerged from the financial crisis ... It's a vast understatement to say that we merely 'rebuilt' our capital position since the crisis. In fact, our capital strength now far exceeds even pre-crisis levels." Mar. 19, 2015, 12:21 PM
WSJ: Banks struggling to unload energy loans
Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and UBS are among the large lenders facing millions in losses on energy loans made last year. The lenders intended to sell the paper, but have had difficulty doing so even after cutting prices."We've been pretty shy about dipping back into energy names," says a loan-portfolio manager at DoubleLine, summing up the industry attitude.It's a sizable setback for Wall Street (not to mention energy companies whose financing has dried up), which has earned $31B in energy company-related fees over the last five years, according to Dealogic.Shades of the mortgage crisis? Not even close, say investors, as banks at the end of the housing bubble held hundreds of billions of dollars of souring mortgages and corporate paper on their books.Source: WSJ ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, KCE, RWW, RYF, KBWC, FINZ Mar. 19, 2015, 7:50 AM | 2 Comments

MKM's scorecard for five big banks after CCAR results
Citigroup's (C +2.7%) $7.8B in buybacks was 10% higher than estimated by MKM analyst David Trone. Combined with the nickel dividend, that's total shareholder returns of $8.4B vs. his $7B expectation.Bank of America (BAC -1%) - though given just conditional approval - is set for $4B in buybacks and a nickel dividend. That's a total return of $6.1B vs. Trone's $3.1B estimate. Trone notes the bank can proceed with its buyback prior to resubmitting plans.JPMorgan's (JPM +1%) $6.4B buyback was shy of Trone's $7B estimate, but the 10% dividend increase was better than forecast. The total capital return of $12.9B vs. his $13.2B forecast is a "marginal negative."The dividend hike to $0.65 at Goldman (GS +2.1%) beat Trone's expectation of $0.62. As for the buyback, Goldman's policy of not disclosing the amount remains in place.Morgan Stanley's (MS +4.5%) capital return of $4.3B is more than double Trone's $1.9B estimate.Source: Benzinga Mar. 12, 2015, 12:47 PM | 4 Comments

Maybe next in line to buy is Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores, the Colombian banking group controlled by Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo.Citi's interest in selling is in keeping with plans to simplify its business, and the bank last October announced its intention to exit consumer banking in 11 countries - these Central American ones being part of that 11.

What Dodd-Frank? Citigroup roars back
Citigroup (NYSE:C) with good reason is being quiet about it - its executives preferring to talk about streamlining and asset sales - but its traders and investment bankers are roaring back at a time when many of the bank's peers are scaling down, writes Peter Eavis in the NYT.The comeback has involved scooping up massive amounts of derivatives, and assets at the unit encompassing the investment bank footed to $1.06T at the end of 2014 - up 6% from 2010 vs. a 6% decline in similar assets at Goldman Sachs, and a 4% decline at JPMorgan.The unit is also raking in profits - the investment bank earned $200M more than the consumer bank in 2012, but $2.5B more in each of the last two years.A little lobbying helps. The bank's people in D.C. helped draft a recent law gutting a provision of Dodd-Frank aimed at pulling taxpayer support from certain types of derivatives.CCAR results are due after the closing bell today.

Citigroup exits Akbank investment at a loss
Citigroup (C -0.1%) purchased a 20% stake in Turkey's 2nd largest bank (by market value) in 2007 for $3.1B, and today sold its remaining 9.9% holding for $1.15. Combined with a previous sale of a near equivalent amount, Citi lost $800M on the investment.At this point for Citi, exiting non-core investments is of more import than wringing every last dollar out of them, nevertheless, some analysts say Citi's willingness to take a big loss on the Turkish lender signals more trouble for that stock market (NYSEARCA:TUR) - the globe's 2nd worst-performer in February.While Citi has exited the retail banking business in Turkey, it will continue to serve corporate and commercial clients.TUR -2.1% premarket, led by a 5.4% decline in Akbank.

Citi's own Winston Wolf guides bank through must-pass stress test
Not long after Citigroup (C) CEO Michael Corbat sent out invitations last spring for the retirement party for former head of Citibank, Gene McQuade, he was asking McQaude to take the most important job at the bank - making sure it passes this year's stress test and CCAR.McQuade grew up in NYC housing projects, reports Christina Rexrode in the WSJ, put himself through college driving a taxi, and - well-liked by both regulators and bankers - has earned a reputation as a go-to person for managing a crisis.“He’s absolutely the person you want in a conflict situation where the stakes are high. Smart, ethical, keeps his cool,” says Dick Kearns, who served with McQuade as a trustee at St. Bonaventure during a 2003 recruiting controversy. "If he were an airline pilot, he'd be Sully Sullenberger."Under McQuade, Citi this year has renovated risk models, hired more compliance staff, and attempted to address a Fed complaint that risk  procedures are too centralized at HQ."We really need to turn this into an A-plus paper," McQuade tells his colleagues.Stress test results are due after the close on Thursday, with the CCAR results six days later.

Some losses, but overall benefit to Citi from OneMain sale
Nice job in getting rid of your most profitable business, Citigroup (C +0.4%), writes Anthony Currie of the sale of OneMain Financial to Springleaf for $4.25B. The unit's ROA of 6.7% is about seven times better than the Citi as a whole, and while earnings of nearly $600M this year are only a fraction of the many billions the entire bank might earn, Citi could use all it can get.Citi boss Michael Corbat, however, has plenty with which he can offset that hit, says Currie, noting a pretax gain of about $1B on the sale along with the opportunity to tap into the bank's roughly $50B DTA. There's also the freeing up of capital from the removal of OneMain's nearly $10B in assets. Assuming Citi holds 10% of that, Corbat can either reinvest $1B or ask the Fed to allow it to be returned to shareholders.Previously: Springleaf sees big things with OneMain purchase (March 3)Previously: Springleaf (finally) lands Citi's OneMain Financial (March 3) Mar. 3, 2015, 2:57 PM | 2 Comments
JPMorgan: Citi's Costco agreement is a big deal
The Costco co-branding deal adds a third leg to the Citigroup (C +0.6%) story, says analyst Vivek Juneja, upgrading the stock to Overweight with price target boosted to $58 from $54.One of his concerns with Citi, says Juneja, has been tepid growth and loss of market share in key businesses like U.S. credit cards, and the Costco deal should reverse this worry. The bank, he assumes, was likely able to win a very competitive bidding process because of its ability to utilize its DTAs.He's not boosting his EPS estimates just yet because Citi has not announced an agreement for Costco's $14B in estimated receivables held by AmEx, but he expects one should follow a la the Best Buy deal in 2013.Turning to the stress test and CCAR, Juneja expects Citigroup to be approved for capital returns this year. He also expects the bank to hit its operating efficiency targets in 2015.Previously: Springleaf (finally) lands Citi's OneMain Financial (March 3)Previously: Citigroup and Visa take AmEx's spot with Costco (March 2) Mar. 3, 2015, 11:23 AM

Citi tips lower markets revenue in Q1
Presenting at the Raymond James conference, Citigroup (C +1.6%) CFO John Gerspach expects Q1 FICC revenue down in the mid-to-high single digits from a year earlier thanks to a slow start in spread products and a hit (reported at $150M) from the SNB's shock franc revaluation in January.Webcast and presentation slides.The presentation of Citi's transformation since the crisis is pretty interesting. The bank had $1.9T of assets balanced on just $23B of CET1 capital in 2008, and now has $1.8T of assets on a full $137B of CET1 capital. Citi Holdings assets of $619B or 32% of total assets in 2008 have been cut to $98B and just 5% of the total.As for headcount, it's been cut to 323K from 241K, but it's a bull market for regulatory and compliance staff, where headcount has been boosted to 26K from 14K.Previously: Citigroup and Visa take AmEx's spot with Costco (March 2) Mar. 2, 2015, 1:05 PM | 1 Comment

Citigroup awaits 'stress test' results
Citigroup (NYSE:C) executives are facing a critical hurdle this month, as they prepare for the institution's "stress test" results, FT reports quoting senior figures at the bank.A year ago Citi became one of a handful of banks to have its capital plan rejected by the Fed, on the grounds that it had inadequate processes in place for assessing its capital needs in the event of a severe recession.If the bank were to fail again, CEO Mike Corbat, CFO John Gerspach and Brian Leach, head of risk, would be under strong pressure from investors to step down.

The price sounds right as the $4B level has been thrown around as a possible sales amount for months, with Springleaf Holdings (LEAF +7.5%) at the top of the list of possible bidders.OneMain Financial is Citigroup's (C +1.2%) consumer/subprime lending business, and Springleaf's natural fit perhaps allowed it to pay more than P-E firms who might otherwise have been buyers.Previously: OneMain sale could create a windfall for Citi owners (Jan. 21) Feb. 20, 2015, 2:32 PM
Corbat gets small pay cut after tough 2014
Citigroup (NYSE:C) CEO Mike Corbat's total pay for 2014 of $13.2M was 9% lower than the previous year. This year's compensation includes deferred stock valued at $3.51B, the same amount in performance-share units, a cash bonus of $4.68M, and a salary of $1.5M.The scorecard: Citigroup's stock was the worst performer among the six largest U.S. banks in 2014, gaining 3.8%, the lender disclosed a $400M loan fraud at its Mexican unit, and the bank failed to win Fed approval for boosted capital returns.Corbat has pretty much staked his job on passing the CCAR this year.SEC Form 8-K Feb. 20, 2015, 9:20 AM | 6 Comments

MKM Partners: January tumble leaves bulge-bracket names cheap again
"We certainly recognize all the headwinds, notably on the regulatory capital side, but low-hanging fruit on capital efficiency actions should drive some ROE improvement," says the team of David Trone and Pankaj Chitrakar, and they expect better CCAR outcomes for at least a few of the names (including Citi, one would think) in a few weeks.As for operating results, whether they come in good or not so good this year hinges on whether the Fed hikes or not. That forecast sounds a lot like 2014, 2013, and 2012, but the two note the likelihood of higher rates appears far higher this year.They maintain Buy ratings on Citigroup (C +0.1%), Morgan Stanley (MS +1%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1%), Bank of America (BAC +0.7%), and JPMorgan (JPM +1.1%), with Citi, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley their top picks.Previously: Financials go on sale in January (Jan. 24) Jan. 29, 2015, 11:47 AM | 2 Comments

Banks and higher rates ... Wait till next year?
2015 has opened much like 2014, with interest rates doing the exact opposite of what most expected, and falling sharply. It's a tough start for bank investors who have been counting on higher interest rates to help boost earnings for a number of years.In the meantime, deposits keep rolling in, and the pace of lending growth isn't quick enough to absorb all the money. In 2014, loan balances rose 4.4%, but securities holdings popped 12%, and cash assets jumped 22%.The good part of falling yields are unrealized gains on those security portfolios - negative a year ago, they're were in the green by about $15B on Dec. 31. More good news, says Goldman's Richard Ramsden: Valuations. The big banks are priced at about 9.9x estimated 2016 earnings, allowing for some nice upside if and when rates do decide to go higher.Reporting Q4 results tomorrow are JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.8%), and on Thursday are Bank of America (BAC -1.4%) and Citigroup  (C -0.9%).

Citigroup quietly scales back global consumer banking
The bank last year went from targeting 120 of the world's top150 cities to focusing its efforts on 100 cities where it has the greatest scale and potential. The result so far is the withdrawal from towns like Tokyo, Lima, Panama City, Dallas, and Houston. In the U.S. Citi (NYSE:C) is now focused on six cities vs. 14 previously.The challenge: Shrink in locations where the bank lacks critical mass, while not losing the brand of having a global network.Jonathan Larsen, who oversees Citi's overseas retail branch business: "We have to make sure that we are not subsidizing marginal operations for long periods."

Should Citigroup be split up?
Goldman made a bunch of headlines at the year's start by suggesting JPMorgan was worth more broken up, and now the WSJ's John Carney takes a look at a similar thesis for Citigroup (C -0.6%). To preview the answer: Citi is an even more attractive break-up candidate.Carney first notes the market isn't exactly pining for a JPMorgan split - its shares trade north of book value, as opposed to Citi which has sold for below book since September 2008.A Citi split could be among its four main businesses, suggests Carney: A global investment bank, a broker dealer focused on FICC trading, a global network of consumer banks, and a U.S. retail bank. Valuing each of these segments similar to smaller peers implies a total value of about $180B vs. today's $160B.Yes, the bank could lose its $50B DTA, but the market may be valuing that at pretty close to zero anyway, says Carney, and the potential for regulatory relief might far outweigh that or any other hurdles.

Energy banking boom is over
The collapse in oil prices is set to crimp one of the few fast growth areas for banks since the financial crisis - lending to the energy industry. Right now, we're just talking about a slowdown in lending, but Charles Peabody - who saw the losses incurred by Texas banks during the 1980s energy slump - expects the current situation to lead to losses as well."It’s been a hot industry, probably a little too hot,” says Cullen/Frost (NYSE:CFR) CEO Dick Evans, whose bank has a sizable energy business. “But it is not time to panic. We have been in the game a long time. I am comfortable with what we have been doing.”The flip side of energy issues might be stronger business for banks elsewhere as consumers find themselves with more money in their pockets after filling up.Among the more sizable banks, Scotiabank (NYSE:BNS) leads the way with 34.6% of its investment banking revenue coming from energy companies. Next is RBC (NYSE:RY), with 20.2%, and then Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) with 14.9% and Citigroup (NYSE:C) with 11.8%. Others include Barclays (NYSE:BCS) with 10.7%, Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) with 8.1%, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) with 7.4%. Jan. 12, 2015, 8:43 AM | 20 Comments

Barclays bullish on the big banks this year
An improving economy and easing of the regulatory burden will be keys for a big move higher in the big banks this year, says Barclays' Jason Goldberg, seeing double-digit percentage gains for the Citigroup (C -2.9%), Bank of America (BAC -3%), JPMorgan (JPM -2.8%), and Wells Fargo (WFC -2.6%).His top pick among the group is Citigroup, where the $65 price target suggests upside of more than 20%.Goldman has a different take, and sees the regulatory burden as making JPMorgan worth more broken up than together.

Citi's "boring" strategy not exactly playing out
Citigroup (C -0.3%) CEO Mike Corbat had a 2014 New Year's resolution to make his bank boring, but instead Citi has pushed into commodities trading, kept a more aggressive prop desk than competitors, and expanded its derivatives business. Alongside, the bank has sold or planned to sell 19 "boring" consumer units across the globe.“They are moving their chips from global consumer to capital markets,” says a GW law professor. "That's troubling because they’ve repeatedly gotten into enormous difficulties with these kinds of speculative trading operations.”Corbat is walking a line between pleasing regulators who this spring will need to approve Citi's capital plans, and meeting his own performance targets. Missing those goals "is clearly a threat to management's tenure," says banking analyst Charles Peabody.Scoreboard: Since Corbat took over as CEO, Citi is up 50% vs. a 49% gain for the KBW Bank Index. In 2014, Citi is higher by 5%, lagging the Index by 300 basis points. Dec. 31, 2014, 10:17 AM

Jefferies results bad omen for investment banks
Jefferies yesterday posted a 73% plunge in fixed-income trading revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30, and a 45% fall in equity-trading revenue. “You’re going to see weaker trading results because of what I’d call bad volatility,” says Charles Peabody, as firms cut back on stock and bond offerings.That Q4 trading revenue is going to be a weak one for the likes of JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS shouldn't be a major surprise as Ciit's Mike Corbat, BofA's Brian Moynihan, and JPM's Marianne Lake said as much when presenting at a financial services conference earlier this month. But the weakness they described is nowhere near what was reported at Jefferies.Alongside the weak trading results, Jefferies is also looking to get rid of Bache - its commodities-trading business. "The fact that they are throwing in the towel on this business just a few years in would suggest that maybe that opportunity is not nearly as robust as they thought it would be,” says UBS's Brennan Hawken.Previously: Jefferies posts loss, mulling sale of Bache unit (Dec. 16, 2014) Dec. 17, 2014, 7:36 AM | 3 Comments
Pabrai still bullish on BofA and Citi
"My feeling is that if a bank has proper reserves and it’s trading well below tangible book value, that is an undervalued bank," Mohnish Pabrai tells Barron's, quickly summing up the investment case for two of his holdings, Bank of America (BAC -1.1%) and Citigroup (C -1.1%). "You could shut down a bank today and if the reserves are correct you would get back the tangible book value."Both are trading a lot closer to book (or even above) then they were when he first invested, but Pabrai considers them still undervalued and expects they'll eventually trade more inline with the higher P/B and P/E multiples of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan.Of his $700M AUM fund which has outperformed the S&P by about 150 basis points annually over the last decade, the Buffett disciple Pabrai keeps fees down thanks to low overhead - he's the sole analyst and portfolio manager.

Lone Star reportedly joins Springleaf in bidding for OneMain, but others pass
Citigroup (NYSE:C) is seeking at least $4B for its subprime lending arm, according to sources, too rich for shops like Carlyle Group, Blackstone, and Warburg Pincus.John Grayken's Lone Star funds, however, has made an offer, though Springleaf Holdings (NYSE:LEAF) is still viewed as the frontrunner as the potential cost savings means it can offer a higher price than a buyout fund.Founded in 1995, Lone Star has made a fortune for investors buying distressed assets from troubled lenders globally.

Banks: "Your money's no good here"
A combination of new regulations and near-zero interest rates has some banks - including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), HSBC, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) - privately telling larger clients to take their deposits elsewhere or face fees on accounts which have long been free.“Ultimately my balances aren’t as profitable for the banks, and that’s going to impact my business,” says an executive with a title insurance company, complaining of sleepless nights amid negotiations with his bankers.BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has begun charging institutional clients money to park money in euros, and State Street (NYSE:STT) says itwill soon begin doing so.Some bankers are advising large clients to break up large deposits across a number of lenders (including smaller banks not subject to the new regulations), and other corporations are going to find themselves needing to build more sophisticated (and riskier) portfolios likely including vehicles like short-term bond funds and uninsured money-market funds.

The dinners themselves aren't the issue, but the discussions conflicting with analysts' published research is.

Banks probed for violating bankruptcy laws
Real sweethearts if you believe the reports, the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) are being investigated by the Feds for still going after borrowers after their debt has been legally discharged in a bankruptcy.Paying little attention to such court-ordered discharges, the banks reportedly are keeping the debt alive on credit reports, more or less attempting to force borrowers to pay on bills which they no longer owe.The issue, say sources, is the way banks report to credit agencies. Once a debt is voided through bankruptcy, creditors must update credit reports showing that debt is cleared. Banks, however, routinely fail to do so, instead leaving notations of "past due" or "charged off." A clerical mistake would be one thing, but, according to a number of bankruptcy judges,, banks refuse to make corrections unless the borrower pays.The banks contend they are complying with all federal laws in their collection and sale of debt. Class-action suits have also been filed and the banks are trying to have them thrown out, arguing its third-party debt buyers who are in control.

Broker-dealers: New SEC plan a Trojan Horse against dark pools
"The exchanges (apparently ICE's NYSE and NDAQ) who have a hand in this and seek to benefit from the onerous version of a trade-at basically put the screws to us," says Michael Masone, legal counsel for equities at Citigroup (NYSE:C), speaking at a SIFMA-sponsored conference.At issue is a SEC pilot program meant to boost trading in smaller-cap names. One of the provisions - the so-called "trade-at" rule - is a stealth attempt at hurting brokerages which run private trading systems (dark pools), said both JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Citi at the conference.The one-year program - if approved (the SEC began seeking public comment this month) - would begin next year and widen the minimum tick at which bids and asks are quoted on exchanges to more than a penny. The plan would create four groups of companies with market caps of less than $5B. One segment would require quotes in increments of a nickel or more, and another will require both quotes and trades to be in five-cent steps. In a third group, trading will be discouraged in dark pools. A fourth group would trade normally.Opposition has been pretty fierce - even within the SEC - but the agency for now has decided to move forward anyway. Nov. 11, 2014, 4:47 PM | 6 Comments

His team's recommendation: Buy "American exceptionalism."In Kostin's view, U.S. economy and corporate fundamentals are still strong, with economic growth expected by Goldman economists to be 3.2% next year, the fastest expansion since 2005. Europe is expected to grow just 1%.What his team likes are those stocks of companies which have a high proportion of domestic sales, plus sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP -0.1%) and Discretionary (XLY +0.7%) which stand to benefit from lower oil prices (plunging again today).As for small caps (IWM +0.9%), Kostin is wary, noting downward earnings revisions have boosted small cap P/E ratios even as prices have declined.The list of S&P 500 names capturing two or more of Kostin's themes: GT, GM, PCLN, AMZN, CMCSA, LOW, DG, TSN, ADM, CVS, AVP, WAG, PXD, HAL, JPM, BAC, SCHW, PNC, MS, C, GNW, LNC, MET, THC, AET, UNH, ESRX, HUM, WLP, BIIB, GILD, DAL, CMI, FLR, CRM, JBL, MA, FB, MU, FSLR, VMC, MON, T.

Banks' Q3 preview: MKM sees mostly earnings beats
"Steadily improving economic and capital markets backdrop will drive investment banking and loan growth higher, while trading is likely to rebound as the extended period of low volume and volatility is starting to shift back toward more normal conditions in September," say MKM's David Trone and Pankaj Chitrakar, expecting to see earnings for five bulge-bracket banks higher by 11% in Q3.The team remains bullish on all five, but sees just four - Citigroup (C -0.9%), Bank of America (BAC +0.5%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.5%), and Morgan Stanley (MS +0.4%) - beating estimates. JPMorgan (JPM +0.3%) should just meet the $1.38 EPS consensus, they say, with strength in investment banking offset by declining mortgage banking. Oct. 10, 2014, 2:37 PM | 17 Comments
FT: FSA accuses six banks of forex system-and-control failures
The U.K.'s Financial Services Authority has accused six banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS (NYSE:UBS), of system and control failures in their forex operations, the FT reports.The allegations are part of the FSA's investigation into the possible manipulation of currency markets, which is one of a number of probes by authorities around the world.Last month, the U.K. regulator started settlement talks with the two banks, as well as with Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) and RBS (NYSE:RBS). The discussions could lead to fines of £1.5B in total.By focusing on an inability to stop staff from engaging in misconduct rather than on actual manipulation, the FSA could help the banks limit the impact of lawsuits that have been filed in the U.S. over forex rigging.

Springleaf reportedly moving closer to bid for Citi's OneMain
Springleaf Financial (LEAF -1.4%) has held discussions with bankers about financing a potential purchase of OneMain Financial, Citigroup's (C -0.7%) subprime consumer lender, reports the WSJ.Perhaps trying to move things along, Citi two weeks ago let leak it was prepping to imminently file for an IPO of the unit. The Journal's sources say Springleaf's financing talks are at an early stage, and will probably speed up once those IPO papers are filed.Citi has been trying to unload Springleaf for some time, but some investors - with subprime maybe about to make a comeback - wonder whether what seemed like a smart move one or two years ago is such a bright idea today. In a strict numbers sense, it may not be, but there's D.C. to think about, and Citi has enough regulatory issues on its plate without adding a subprime business to them.Previously: Citi reportedly to file for OneMain Financial IPO this month Oct. 2, 2014, 12:00 PM | 6 Comments
Wells and Citi lose bid to toss suit over credit reports
The suit - which is seeking class action status - claims Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup's (NYSE:C) CitiMortgage violated federal law by falsely notifying credit reporting agencies that thousands of homeowners went through bankruptcies or foreclosures (Experian is also a defendant).The lawsuit claims the mistakes were made after mortgage customers of the two banks sold their homes in a short sale, which is very much not a bankruptcy or foreclosure. The banks, says the plaintiffs, nevertheless reported bankruptcies and foreclosures to credit bureaus and correct their mistake when notified.In other Citi news, a Delaware court has ordered the bank to turn over records related to its Banamex unit to a Oklahoma pension fund which wants to know what Citi executives knew and when they knew it.

Holder’s departure could signal end of big mortgage cases
Today's resignation of Attorney General Eric Holder could mark the beginning of the end of the Justice Department’s push to hold big banks accountable for their conduct leading up to the financial crisis.Several big banks, including Goldman Sachs (GS -2.1%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -1.1%), are still under investigations by the Justice Department for their sale of flawed mortgage securities before 2008, but settlements in those cases are expected to be much smaller than the big sums extracted from Bank of America (BAC -1.8%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM -2%) and Citigroup (C -2.2%).Another sign that the big bank cases may be winding down: Tony West, who was Holder’s point man in the bank settlement talks, recently left the Justice Department to join PepsiCo as its general counsel.

Six months later, Corbat is back - meeting with heads of state, regulators, clients, and bank employees. His message is one of regional growth even as Citi pares back its global operations.“Opportunities for further growth include the commercial banking opportunity - being the bank of choice of the champions of tomorrow and sustaining our retail, cards and wealth management leadership in Asia,” he says.Citi, of course, is considering the sale of its Japanese retail unit - "just one part of restructuring by a thousand cuts,” says a bullish Mike Mayo, also in Asia this week. “Citi is committed to Asia ... but it doesn’t mean it has to be in every market ...

Citi and BofA to offer mortgage deals for troubled borrowers
Isn't this one of the ways we got into the housing mess? Citigroup (NYSE:C) signs on with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to fund 15-year mortgages at below-market rates for borrowers with low incomes, spotty credit histories, or both.The loans are being originated by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), a group - that has the ear of HUD - known for pushing banks to show they're fulfilling the terms required of them by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (no redlining).The moves also follow the banks' massive mortgage settlements, part of which were agreements to provide assistance to troubled mortgagees, though both say this new program is not related.For its part, NACA says the foreclosure-loss rate on more than 18K purchase loans it has originated since 2006 is about 0%, with one of the reasons being NACA making up to three months of mortgage payments when borrowers run into trouble.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) continues to expect moderate growth in consumer revenue both sequentially and year over year in Q3, says CFO John Gerspach, presenting at the Barclays Financial Services conference.Presentation slidesInvestment banking revenues are poised to be up from a year ago, but lower from Q2 thanks to seasonally lower underwriting volumes. FICC revenue looks to be roughly inline with a year ago.As for core expenses, excluding legal costs (which should remain elevated), costs will be higher thanks to all the money being spent on assuring the bank will pass next year's stress tests.

Richard Pzena sees value in big financials and big oil
"Most of the reason that banks are underearning relative to their historical norms ... is economic and not regulatory," says Richard Pzena (NYSE:PZN), who remains bullish on the TBTFs. Low interest rates, weak trading, and "government persecution" are the three factors, and - should these normalize - earnings could nearly double at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), though JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) boost would be more modest. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another favorite.Broad financial ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF, FINZ Another cheap sector is energy, says Pzena, and based on relative valuation against the broader market - whether price-to-book or price-to-earnings - the major integrated oil companies are selling near all-time lows.What the market is missing, says Pzena, is the nature of oil investment. The old days saw capital spending one year, and boosted volume the next. Projects nowadays are far larger and require several years of spending before returns roll in. "We think those big new projects are going to perform and produce decent returns."

Citigroup earning little in profits from Japan retail ops
Citibank Japan had net income of $12.9M last year - that's less than the total compensation of CEO Michael Corbat, and it helps explain why C has reportedly put the unit on the block.“It is very difficult to make money from lending in Japan unless you’re in higher-margin consumer lending or if you’ve got a very large scale of operations like the megabanks have,” says analyst David Marshall. “In an environment in which interest rates are very low and investors are still somewhat risk adverse despite economics, it is hard to make money.”Among the possible buyers are Shinsei Bank and Mitsubishi UJF (NYSE:MTU), according to the Nikkei.Previously: WSJ: Citi considering sale of retail ops in Japan Aug. 22, 2014, 8:15 AM | 2 Comments

Brazil's money laundering probe linked to state-run Petrobras (PBR -1.2%) is spreading to financial institutions as prosecutors investigate whether they met compliance requirements.Court documents cite units of banks including Citigroup (NYSE:C), Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN) and HSBC, as well as Brazil-based Itau Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB) and Banco Bradesco (NYSE:BBD) as holding accounts or executing operations linked to the alleged laundering of 10B reais.The refining division at Petrobras already is under investigation for runaway spending including alleged inflated contracts to suppliers, and is cited as one of the possible sources of cash being laundered in the case dubbed “Car Wash” by police.

Feds reject "living wills" of 11 major lenders
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC say the bankruptcy plans submitted by 11 of the largest banks make "unrealistic or inadequately supported" assumptions and "fail to make, or even to identify, the kinds of changes in firm structure and practices that would be necessary to enhance the prospects for" an orderly failure. Ouch!Full feedbackThe 11 dinged: BAC, BK, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, and the U.S. units of BCS, CS, DB, and UBS.To review: Dodd-Frank requires banks annually submit a "living will" detailing their operations and exposures and how they could be dismantled without the need of a bailout in the event they near failure. Pleasing the regulators is a must as they have the power to force tougher capital rules or restrictions on growth, or even mandate a breakup of the lenders. As for the current failures, the banks have about a year to address D.C.'s concerns."Despite the thousands of pages of material these firms submitted, the plans provide no credible or clear path through bankruptcy that doesn't require unrealistic assumptions and direct or indirect public support," says the FDIC's #2 official, Thomas Hoenig.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF, FINZ Aug. 6, 2014, 8:48 AM | 33 Comments
Judge grudgingly approves Citi's $285M fraud settlement with the SEC
"That Court has now fixed the menu, leaving this Court with nothing but sour grapes," says Judge Jed Rakoff, not sounding terribly happy after giving a green light to the Citigroup (C -0.5%) settlement in which it will not be forced to admit to wrongdoing in the 2007 sale of certain MBS."The settlements reached by the governmental regulatory bodies and enforced by the judiciary's contempt powers will in practice be subject to no meaningful oversight whatsoever."

Citigroup (C -2%) further cut its exposure to Russia, according to its 10-Q, taking it down to $8.9B from $9.4B. As for just-defaulted Argentina, the bank estimates it could lose up to $80M should the country be downgraded by U.S. regulators.Also included in the filing: This week the SEC informed Citi it has ended an investigation into MBS it packaged and sold, and won't recommend any enforcement action. This is separate from the $7B settlement with the DOJ over mortgages.

Big banks' reserve releases tick higher in Q2
The big banks aren't quite ready to let go of their reserve releases: The big four - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) - released a combined $2.25B of their bad-loan reserves in Q2, up nearly 20% from the $1.88B they released in Q1.The banks continue to see improvement in their customers’ credit quality, but their earnings continue to rely in part on freeing up some of their rainy-day cushions, rather than being able to generate strong earnings from their operating businesses.Even with the Q2 uptick, the banks are releasing less in the way of reserves than they have for most of the past four years, and analysts see the practice ending before too much longer.Some regional banks such as Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) that had been releasing reserves started building their reserves up again by small amounts during Q2.

Of Citigroup's $7B settlement, CFO says ~$3B will be deductible
Citigroup (NYSE:C) will get a tax break on at least part of its $7B settlement with the U.S. government over its mortgage securities; CFO John Gerspach said during today's earnings call that the $500M in payments to state attorneys general and the FDIC would be deductible, along with any costs the bank actually incurs in relation to consumer relief, which could be less than the $2.5B called for in the settlement.Tax deductibility of banks’ big settlements with the government has been controversial: Last fall, JPMorgan Chase reached a $13B settlement with the government over mortgage issues but with $7B of that amount deductible.

Wells Fargo getting no help from Citi strength, thanks to JPM downgrade
Wells Fargo (WFC -0.5%) is sliding again, despite the boost provided to other big U.S banks by Citigroup’s (C +3.4%) earnings, as investors remain disappointed with WFC's Q2 results and J.P. Morgan downgrades shares to Neutral from Overweight.WFC faces more near-term headwinds - a modestly higher expense run rate, lower fee revenue growth, higher taxes - to its revenue growth initiatives, JPM says as it cuts its 2014 and 2015 EPS estimates to $4.15 from $4.21 and to $4.32 from $4.37, respectively.WFC has been the top performing big bank, outperforming peers by ~700 bp YTD, but the firm sees relatively less upside to the stock with lower EPS estimates and the share price close to its new $52 price target (down from $54.50).

Citi +3.7% as Q2 helped by better than expected fixed income trading
Citigroup (NYSE:C) +3.7% premarket as Q2 results solidly beat analyst expectations while investors show relief that the bank reached a settlement with the Justice Department over mortgage securities it sold in the run-up to the financial crisis.Citi took a Q2 pretax charge of $3.8B tied to the deal, which sent Q2 earnings falling 96% Y/Y to $181M but adjusted net income, which excludes the settlement charge, was $3.93B, or $1.24/share, vs. $3.89B, or $1.25/share a year earlier and analyst expectations of ~$1.05.The 12% drop in adjusted revenue from fixed income markets and the 15% fall in trading revenue were much better results than CFO John Gerspach had warned earlier.After stripping out the settlement charge, Q2 operating expenses fell ~3% from both the year-ago quarter and Q1 to $11.77B.Mortgage originations fell 64% Y/Y but were 19% higher Q/Q, as the refinancing boom continues to wane amid higher interest rates; overall revenue in consumer banking, which includes mortgage banking, fell 3.5% Y/Y but rose 0.9% Q/Q to $9.38B.Cost of credit fell 15% Y/Y to $1.73B.

Rumored Citi settlement out of line
The bank issued $91B in private-label MBS between 2005 and 2008, say Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck and Manan Gosalia. That's just 20% of what JPMorgan sold and 14% of Bank of America's issuance.The reported $7B settlement would amount to 7.7% of Citigroup's (C -0.3%) pre-crisis issuance vs. JPMorgan's 2% settlement - this despite the fact that losses on Citi's MBS book were inline with its peer group. Nevertheless, the team notes these press rumors have been somewhat on the mark and cut their Q2 EPS estimate by $0.70 to $0.40 to account for the $4B hard-dollar amount (the other $3B is for borrower relief).Up next is Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), which will now see boosted pressure to reach a deal with the DOJ, and Morgan has baked in a $12B settlement, or 1.8% of the face amount of securities issued. Other press reports have suggested a number closer to $17B. Jul. 9, 2014, 11:51 AM | 72 Comments

Global M&A deals in H1 totaled $1.571T, according to Mergermarket, up 56% over the same period in 2013, and up 29.8% from last year's 2nd half. in the U.S., $694.6B of deals in H1 nearly doubled that of one year prior. European deals of $453.6B gained 35.5%, and Asian deals of $286.7B rose 56.8%.The M&A boom could help offset at least some of the widely expected continued trading slowdown this quarter (banks begin reporting their Q2s in about 10 days), and Goldman (GS +0.1%) tops the advisor tables with $533.8B in deals in H1, up 112% from a year ago.

Report: Banks to lose billions from new swaps rules
Banks could lose up to $4.5B in annual revenue as new regulations alter how swaps are traded, according to a report from McKinsey & Co. That amount is equal to 35% of the $13B in revenue booked by banks from trading in rate derivatives, and it comes at a time when FICC business is already on the decline.At issue are new rules requiring swaps trade on electronic systems rather than over the phone ("Thanks, big boy"), and the greater transparency should bite into profits. To counter this, says McKinsey's Roger Rudisuli, banks will have to cut costs and realign teams to focus attention on fewer customers.The usual suspects make up the 5 largest U.S. swaps dealers: JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS.ETFs: IAI, KCE, KBWC Jun. 25, 2014, 10:04 AM | 15 Comments

Citi aims for growth in Brazil
Citigroup (C) has recently sold off retail banking operations in Greece and Spain, but it's looking for growth in Brazil and hopes to boost its customer base there by 5% this year and again in 2015.Citi has shifted focus to 150 global cities with the highest potential for consumer-banking growth and Brazil has three on the list: Sao Paulo, Rio, and Belo Horizonte. The bank's focus, says Helio Magalhaes - the President of the Brazil unit - will be on better-off customers, and Citi plans to open a flagship branch in Sao Paulo's financial center.The only U.S. bank with retail branches in Brazil, Citi has 350K retail customers and 50K corporate clients, the same numbers as in 2012. The bank also has about 1M credit cards in-country under the Citi and Diner's Club brands (the Credicard unit with 4M cards was sold last year). Jun. 24, 2014, 9:01 AM

Passing next stress test is job #1 at Citi
"I'll put my jacket on and walk out the door," Citigroup (C) CEO Michael Corbat has told Chairman Michael O'Neill should the bank flunk the Fed's stress test next year. In a WSJ "inside baseball" account of the failure and Citi's efforts since, Corbat is described as having turned his attention away from moving the business forward for instead a laser focus on proving to bureaucrats at the Fed that Citi's global business model is one that can survive the next crisis."Are you targeting our business model? Our strategy," asked Corbat point-blank to Fed officials in a person-to-person meeting shortly after the stress test failure. For Citi to continue to operate all over the world, replied the Fed group, the bank needed to significantly improve its ability to operate and assess risk.Corbat returned from the meeting with an urgency to simplify operations and overhaul aspects of the bank's risk apparatus, and Citi has since sold its Greek consumer unit and put its Spanish one on the block. "The federal government's overreach is excessive over these big banks, particularly of Citi," says longtime investor William Smith of SAM Advisors, urging Corbat to instead push back against regulators.Becoming more clear is that a stress test failure next year will mean not just Corbat's job, but also a likely break-up of the bank. "Two extremes, from agitated investors to tough-minded regulators, will unite to break up Citigroup as too big to manage," says Mike Mayo. Jun. 21, 2014, 7:40 AM | 15 Comments
Citi's Mexican operations suffer amid fraud
The top underwriter in peso-denominated bonds last year with an 18% market share, Citigroup's (C +0.2%) Banamex has fallen to fifth place with just a 9% share in 2014, according to Bloomberg. As recently as February, Citi was still in first place, but then the loan-fraud was discovered. The bank has slipped from first to sixth in dollar-denominated bonds by Mexican issuers as well.“The effort to impose a big increase in internal controls is one that is clearly very labor-intensive," says finance professor and former Goldmanite Roy Smith, though a Banamex spokesman says Citi fails to see a connection between the fraud and the slide in underwriting. “We are confident that to end the year we’re going to be at same levels in terms of numbers of transactions that we had last year and in previous years."Banamex is Mexico's 2nd-largest bank by loans and Citi's largest emerging market operation. It has finished 1st or 2nd in bond underwriting every year since 2006. Jun. 18, 2014, 3:31 PM

In advisory business, it was Goldman Sachs and BAML - each bringing in about $1.5B - which led the way.

Sell-side questions $10B penalty for Citi
The number seems proportionally well above the $17B amount wanted from Bank of America, notes JPMorgan's Vivek Juneja, and stands against the $4B offered by Citigroup (C -0.3%). It's possible, says Juneja, DOJ uncovered other significant issues or significantly higher loss rates on MBS issued by Citi as opposed to BofA.In any case, its seems likely Citi will have to book a sizable charge to boost litigation reserves, thus cutting somewhat future capital returns. Near term, says Junjea, the litigation risk combined with weak trading and the slowdown in Mexico (Citi's largest EM) should keep the stock in the penalty box.Previously: Report: DOJ wants more than $10B from Citi over mortgages Reiterating its Outperform rating on Citi, Wells Fargo calls the $10B figure too high and says an agreement in the $8B range seem likely, which would cut EPS by $0.95.

Is Citi now the victim of fraud in China?
Citigroup (C -0.9%) and a number of other large Western banks active in commodity financing deals in China are frantically trying to assess if they've fallen victim to suspected commodities fraud emanating from the giant Qingdao port, reports the NYT. At issue are whether loans the banks made actually have the collateral they're supposed to have at the port.A typical deal in this murky world of finance: Copper (or another metal) is imported using a letter of credit, then warehoused in duty-free zones and pledged as collateral for cheap bank loans, the money from which is then used to speculate. After a few months, the importer either sells the copper or the speculation. Goldman estimates up to $160B has flowed into China since 2010 through these types of loans.The investigation centers around one importer who may have pledged the same stocks of metals as collateral for multiple loans, amassing a debt of more than $160M.Citigroup is focusing on loans to Mercuria Group, and late last month Mercuria informed Citi improprieties may have taken place at metals warehouses. Citi is already dealing with the fallout from the Mexican fraud, and this could raise further issues about controls at the bank. Jun. 11, 2014, 9:55 AM | 5 Comments

Trading decline at banks is secular, says RBC analyst
"The market has permanently shrunk," says RBC's Gerard Cassidy of fixed-income trading business at banks. FICC income of $22B in Q1 was off 37% from a year ago, and updates recently from the likes of Citigroup (C +0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM -0.5%), and Goldman Sachs (GS -0.4%) suggest Q2 could be worse.Of the two reasons - a new regulatory regime putting the squeeze on bank business practices and the absence of volatility, one may go away, but the other isn't.The new regime has banks cutting staff and restructuring units - especially from the likes of European players like Barclays (BCS +0.2%), Credit Suisse (CS +0.3%), and UBS (UBS -0.7%).“What these companies have decided to do, some more dramatic more than others, is restructure their business,” says Cassidy. “You just have to manage your business differently by realigning your cost structure to the new level of revenues due to the changes form rules, regulations and laws."ETFs: IAI, KCE, KBWC May 30, 2014, 3:36 PM | 1 Comment
Investigation reveals loan changes before Citi Mexican loan fraud
Mexican authorities are asking why Citigroup's (C +0.4%) Mexican unit extended due dates and raised credit limits for Oceanografia more than a year before the fraud was discovered. "You could argue they were being flexible," says Jamie Gonzalez, head of Mexico's CNBV, which is conducting the probe. "What is surprising is that the controls weren't there."In 2012, Citigroup extended the time between when it lent funds to Oceanografia and when Pemex repaid to 90 days from 20, and the next year it boosted to amount of financing available. "While the flow of resources was coming in, everybody was happy," says Gonzalez.The bulk of the disputed $400M was lent within about 90 days before the fraud was discovered.

BofA, Citi, and JPMorgan are Buys on break-up potential, says MKM
"The break-up of the universal banks is inevitable," says MKM Partner's David Trone, "not a question of 'if,' but 'when.'" Managements clearly disagree, but they're more interested in what's best for them, not the shareholders, says Trone, and it's only a matter of time before activist investors come knocking.Initiating coverage on BAC, C, and JPM with Buy ratings on each because their break-up will release "significant pent-up shareholder value," Trone says be patient. "We see little chance of this emerging within the next twelve months." May 21, 2014, 3:51 PM | 17 Comments
Citi aims to boost mortgage lending
"We think today we are below our natural market share," says Citigroup (C +0.1%) chief of U.S. consumer and commercial banking, Jane Fraser, speaking at a Mortgage Banker's Association conference.The bank's share of mortgage originations dipped to just 3.4% last year vs. 8.1% when then-CEO Charles Prince was "dancing" in 2007. Part of the plan to boost mortgages will be a renewed focus on buying them from correspondent lenders (hasn't BofA stopped this practice?).Promising to be "extremely careful" with lending quality, Fraser also says, "Citi is no longer reacting to the crisis ... It’s a strategy agreed to with our senior management and our board, and they’re comfortable with it.” May 20, 2014, 11:16 AM | 4 Comments
Citi steps into commodity opening
The bank plans to double its commodities trade finance team within the next three years, according its global head of commodities Kris Van Broekhoven. A big player in trade finance - short-term lending guaranteeing payment on international shipments - Citigroup (C -0.3%) started building a commodity trade finance team in 2012, first in energy, then metals and minerals, and next up is agricultural commodities.The move comes as rivals like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan exit the business of trading physical commodities. When these operations were part of investment banks, traders could rely on quick access to financing. "When they move, their funding changes, and they turn to the commodity trade finance banks to fund them, so that creates an expanded market for us," says Van Broekhoven.

Banamex scandal claims another 11 scalps at Citi
"We have unfortunately identified additional employees across business and functional lines whose actions or inactions failed to protect our company from this fraud," says Ciitgroup (C -0.7%) CEO Michael Corbat in an employee memo. The eleven fired include four managing directors, two of whom are business heads in Mexico. "The financial impact of this fraud has been significant ...  the impact to our credibility is harder to calculate. Arguably, it is more damaging than the financial costs."In other Citi news, the bank is reportedly looking to boost its commodities business as many of the other big banks scale back. According to Reuters, Citi plans to begin trading physical Canadian crude oil.

Big business win for Citi
Citigroup (C) grabs some business from JPMorgan (JPM) winning a contract to deliver custody and securities-lending services to Norway's mammoth sovereign wealth fund ($866B AUM).

Cyclical or secular? JPMorgan warns again on trading business
With Q1 results for the global banks just in the books, JPMorgan (JPM) becomes the first to warn on trading revenues in Q2, expecting markets revenue to slip 20% after declining 17% in Q1.SEC Form 10-QAs in the past, the biggest driver of the slide is weakness in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) as investors continue to shy from exotic fixed-income vehicles contrived by bankers, and instead favor less profitable (for the bond desks) government and high-grade corporate bonds. There's also new regulations which have forced banks away from lucrative businesses like energy trading."I don't look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup," said CEO Jamie Dimon on Q1's earnings call (the bank did $5.37B in trading business in Q1), stressing his belief that the current tough time for trading is cyclical not secular.JPMorgan fell 1.5% in after hours trading following the news last night.

Primary dealers stung by Treasury rally
Caught in the Treasury rally this month are Wall Street's primary dealers who amassed a $5.2B short position in government paper in March - the first net short position since September 2011 - amid the hawkish rumblings out of the Fed.“We had that big selloff and the dealers got short then, and then we turned around and the Fed says, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa: it’s lower for longer again,’” says fund manager Mark MacQueen. “The dealers are really worried here. You get really punished if you take a lot of risk.”Dealers used to short Treasurys to hedge their holdings of other types of debt like corporate bonds and mortgages, but that changed after the crisis. Corporate debt inventories have been slashed 76% from the 2007 peak thanks to capital requirements (which essentially force them to hold little but Treasurys).“During the crisis, the Fed went to great pains to save primary dealers,” says Christ Whalen. “Now, because of quantitative easing and other dynamics in the market, it’s not just treacherous, it’s almost a guaranteed loss.”Among the dealers who have reported Q1 results so far, JPMorgan (JPM) saw a 21% drop in fixed-income business, Citigroup (C) 18%, and Credit Suisse (CS) 25%.

New rules forces largest banks to hold another $68B in capital
Finalizing the criteria on the eight largest banks' leverage ratios - a minimum 5% at the holding company level and 6% at the bank subsidiary level - U.S. regulators impose a far tougher standard than international norms of 3%.The eight affected: BK, BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, WFC.The regulators at work were the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC, and the Fed's Dan Tarullo indicates he wants to go further, signaling the central bank may boost the risk-based capital surcharge to a higher level than the international standard. The most to lose in this scenario would be investment banks like Goldman and Morgan Stanley who don't have the deposit bases of their retail brethren.Banks have until January 1, 2018 to comply with the new rule.Related ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, FINU, KCE, RWW, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, KBWC Apr. 8, 2014, 4:43 PM | 19 Comments

Excess capital means Citi won't hit 10% ROE target next year
"Mathematically it's very challenging; this is a very clear setback for them," says Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden of the Fed's rejection of Citigroup's (C -1.5%) capital plan and how it makes the bank hitting its 10% ROE target by 2015 difficult to reach.Prior to the rejection, Goldman had estimated Citi would be allowed to return just $15B - $10B less than it would need to in order to hit that 10% figure. WIth the Fed only approving Citi to maintain 2013's level of capital return, Goldman figures the bank's shortfall has risen to $17B.The excess capital isn't going anywhere, reminds Mike Mayo, but with it on Citi's balance sheet, the bank probably can't hit that ROE forecast.

Too Big To Fail not solved, says IMF
Absent reforms, another financial crisis is likely to leave taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions, warns the IMF, estimating the world's biggest banks receive up to $590B in implicit public subsidies because of their TBTF status.Said subsidies include bankers who still have a "heads I win, tails you lose" attitude, and investors who lend at lower cost to banks than they might otherwise. The IMF calculated the size of the subsidies by comparing the CDS prices and credit ratings across larger and smaller banks. While the amount has fallen since the crisis, it still remains sizable. "All in all ... the expected probability that systemically important banks will be bailed out remains high in all regions."Subsidies for the biggest players are "like insurance for which banks don't need to pay a premium," says senior IMF analyst Gaston Gelos.Full report (starting on pg. 34)Among the usual suspects: BBVA, BBD, BAC, BCS, BK, BNS, C, CS, DB, GS, HSBC, IBN, ING, JPM, LYG, MS, NBG, RY, STT, TD, UBS, WFC, WBK.

Judge: Banks must face suit over interest-rate manipulation
A judge has ruled that a group of banks that includes JP Morgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Barclays (BCS) and UBS (UBS) must face a class-action lawsuit that they rigged yen-denominated benchmark interest rates from 2006-2010.However, District Judge George Daniels dismissed related claims against the banks for antitrust violations and unjust enrichment.UBS, Barclays and RBS have already reached settlements with authorities for the manipulation of such rates.

A check of payout ratios allowed by CCAR process
Count Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch as surprised about the Fed's denial of Citigroup's (C -0.5%) capital return plan. Maybe Citi is just too tough for regulators to get their arms around as it is the most complicated of all the bank holding companies.Included in the Credit Suisse report is this handy chart of dividends, buybacks, and payout ratios for all of the CCAR banks for 2013 and 2014. Things are loosening up - the median payout ratio (includes dividends and buybacks) this year of 71% compares to 59% in 2013. The dividend payout ratio rises to 26% from 23%.It helps to be smaller - among the TBTFs, Citi's payout ratio is just 8%, BofA (BAC) 37%, JPMorgan (JPM) 56%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 41%. Wells Fargo is above the median though, being allowed a payout of 79%.The regionals (KRE), trust banks, and credit card companies - for the most part - were all allowed payout ratios above the median.The strongest capital returns vs. CS's expectations are those for BNY Mellon (BK), Capital One (COF), KeyCorp (KEY), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, RKH, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ, AIRR Mar. 28, 2014, 11:41 AM | 4 Comments
Citi sets redemption of $2B of TruPS
Getting busy after the rejection of its capital return plan by the Fed, Citigroup (C) announces the redemption of $2B worth of trust preferred securities."The redemptions announced today are consistent with Citi's liability management strategy, and reflect Citi's strategy of continuing to enhance the efficiency of its funding and optimize its capital structure under Basel III."

Fed rejection a shock to Citi
"Surprise would be an understatement," says one Citigroup (C -5.5%) executive when the top brass learned - 24 hours ahead of the markets - of the Fed rejecting the bank's capital return plan. Traveling on business in Korea, CEO Michael Corbat - who was on the conference call when the Fed relayed its decision - cut his trip short to get back to NYC for a board meeting. Following the meeting, he sat down with FRBNY boss Bill Dudley."It's too early ... why are you returning capital when you need it," is the message the Fed is trying to get across, according to a source, who adds the central bank looks like it wants Citi to continue selling off noncore operations.Will heads roll? “Since becoming CEO, I have spoken with many of you about the need to hold ourselves accountable for what takes place at our firm," said Corbat in a staff memo today. "I am accountable for getting this right.” Mar. 27, 2014, 3:09 PM | 24 Comments

Investors ratchet down bank capital return outlook
It's a slow grind for bank capital returns (at least those subject to the CCAR), notes Goldman' Richard Ramsden, with payout ratios boosted just four percentage points to 62% this year. There are clear winners, he says: The credit card companies led by AXP and COF and the trust banks led by BK. Regional banks (KRE) boosted returns but generally fell short of expectations (with HBAN and PNC being the exceptions). Worst-performing were the TBTFs, though JPM and WFC were positives."CCAR highlighted the challenges large-caps have in returning excess capital," he says, with Citigroup's (C) failure a reminder the process is unpredictable. With all that excess capital remaining on the balance sheet, Ciit's 2015 goal of a 10% ROTCE appears unlikely to be met.For Bank of America (BAC), it's resubmission - a better outcome than outright failure - reminds that even well-capitalized banks are "bound by stressed capital and could have trouble returning outsized capital."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, RKH, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ, AIRR Mar. 27, 2014, 8:36 AM | 6 Comments
Citi hit with two downgrades after capital plan rejection
Both Bernstein and KBW remove Outperform ratings on Citigroup (C) the morning after its capital return plan was rejected by the Fed for "qualitative" reasons. One wonders whether this disappointment wasn't already priced in as Citi has underperformed this year, and for some time been the only one of the major banks trading below book value. Shares are off 5% in premarket action.Overall, the bank capital returns announced yesterday are below expectations, says Compass Point's Kevin Barker, but Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) - which boosted the dividend 20% and announced a buyback for about 3% of the float - was better than hoped.XLF -0.1% premarketETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAI, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, RKH, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KCE, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ, KBWC, AIRR Mar. 27, 2014, 7:25 AM | 2 Comments

Citi dives 5.6% after Fed rejects capital plan
"We are deeply disappointed by the Fed's decision regarding the additional capital actions we requested," says Citigroup (C) CEO Michael Corbat. "The additional capital actions represented a modest level of capital return and still allowed Citi to exceed the required threshold on a quantitative basis."As previously reported, Citigroup's capital return plan was rejected for "qualitative" reasons, with the Fed saying promised improvements in the bank's capital planning processes have not been made fast enough.Citi had shot for a boost in the dividend to a nickel a share, and a $6.4B repurchase program.

The Federal Reserve is due to say today whether it approves banks' plans to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock.

Citi shakes up FX trading management
Under legal scrutiny for possible price-fixing, Citigroup (C -0.3%) restructures its foreign exchange trading desk, reports Reuters, creating a new position of global head of trading and bringing its electronic and voice trading businesses closer together. London-based Richard Bibbey will assume the new role in addition to his current position as head of electronic FX trading.The bank earlier this year put two traders on leave and fired its London-based head of European spot trading Rohan Ramchandani. Also, its global head of FX business, Anil Prasad, is exiting, though his departure is "entirely unrelated" to the investigations, according to a source.Citi is the world's 2nd-largest FX firm, according to Euromoney, with nearly 15% of the $5.3T flowing through the markets on a daily basis.

TBTFs pass stress tests, but don't get an "A"
It's a sluggish day for the TBTFs after yesterday's post-close stress test results. Satiated investors may be selling the news, or perhaps the lenders didn't pass with enough flying colors.Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch's team had estimated a Tier 1 common ratio under the severely adverse scenario of 8.6% for Bank of America (BAC -1.5%), but it came in at just 6% from the Fed - only 100 basis points higher than the minimum. Citigroup (C -0.1%) - estimated at 10% - came in at 7%, JPMorgan (JPM +0.4%) - estimated at 6.5% - came in at 6.3%.Morgan Stanley (MS -0.5%), meanwhile, missed CS's estimate by a whopping 400 basis points, while Goldman missed by 170. "Not surprisingly, the capital markets sensitive banks appear on the lower end of the range given losses associated with a large counterparty default, in addition to higher trading losses vs. regional bank peers," says Orenbuch.Jefferies' Ken Usdin says the lower numbers confirm the "teeth" of the stress tests. "Our initial take is that discrepancies were largely driven by higher charge-off and balance sheet growth assumptions used by the Fed."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, FINU, RWW, KCE, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, KBWC Mar. 21, 2014, 3:10 PM | 5 Comments

The TBTFs join to fight proposed bank tax
Half a million doesn't buy much anymore. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R, Mich.) - a sizable recipient of Wall Street donations - has the large financial institutions displeased with his proposal to levy a tax on them. He says they deserve to pay up for the lower borrowing costs they receive because of their perceived government backstop, a notion the banks dispute.The proposal is part of larger tax reform expected to get serious discussion after the mid-term elections, and a Camp spokeswoman says the overall plan will make banks "some of the biggest winners."In discussions to hold a fundraiser for the NRC, Goldman Sachs (GS +0.9%) reportedly opted out over its concerns. Smaller bankers join in with their much larger brethren: "We're going to beat this like a rented mule," says Cam Fine, who heads the Independent Community Bankers Association. "This is a united effort."Camp's tax would apply to financial firms with assets greater than $500B, levying a 0.035% tax on total assets each year. Among those affected (in addition to Goldman) are AIG, BAC, C, GE Capital, JPM MET, MS, PRU, and WFC. The largest could pay more than $2B per year under the plan.

He continues to have a Hold rating on the name with $55 price targetThe move comes after CFO John Gerspach - speaking at an institutional investor conference on Monday  - said markets revenues this quarter were off by a high mid-teens percentage, investment banking revenue was tracking lower, and expenses headed higher.Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch cut his Q1 forecast to $1.21 from $1.41 and FY14 to $5 from $5.25.

An early barometer for the investment banks (GS, MS), Jefferies Group - now a part of Leucadia National (LUK) - estimates investment banking revenue rose 42% this quarter from a year ago, but fixed-income revenue continues its weak trend, falling 17%.Speaking at an investor conference yesterday, Citigroup (C) CFO John Gerspach said he expects trading revenue to drop by a "high mid-teens percentage" this quarter. His comments come days after JPMorgan - at its investor day - flagged continuing trading revenue weakness on the order of a 15% decline. Prior to the JPMorgan meeting, analysts had been expecting a decline more on the order of high single digits."It sounds like more bloodletting on Wall Street,” Mercer Capital's Jeff Davis. “What we are seeing is a function of investors being scared of bonds because the math is bad.

OneMain Financial (formerly CitiFinancial) is housed in Citi Holdings - a crisis-era creation of Citigroup (C +0.3%) to house assets it wished to sell or wind down. Speaking recently at a conference, CFO John Gerspach said the business was profitable, but did not fit with the wealthier customers the bank is targeting.Among the P-E firms sniffing around is Fortress Investment Group (FIG), a majority owner of another subprime finance player, Springleaf Holdings (LEAF +6.4%). Fortress picked up its stake in Springleaf from AIG amid the financial crisis. A combination of Springleaf and OneMain has been bandied about for years, and Hank Greenberg and Sandy Weill talked about a deal more than a decade ago when they respectively ran AIG and Citi.The sale of OneMain presents a dilemma for Citi: One hand it continues to chip away at the assets in Ciit Holdings - $117B at year's end vs. a peak of more than $875B - but, the business is profitable and the bank needs the income stream to help take advantage of its $53B in DTAs. One option would be the sale of a minority stake. Feb. 21, 2014, 4:15 PM | 2 Comments

Expecting dividends to grow 49% on average for the banks subject to the Fed's stress tests (about the same as last year), Markit, says Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) will lead the way with 400% boosts. "They are the last of the major banks paying minimal dividends ... change is overdue."While 400% is a big number, Citi and BofA will continue to lag their peers in terms of yield (400% growth on a penny just leads to a nickel).Also expected to have a significant pop is Morgan Stanley (MS) - a doubling of the payout to $0.10 per share and a 1.4% yield. Others in the top 5 in increases are Zions Bancorp (ZION) with a 75% boost to $0.07 and Regions Financial (RF) up 67% to $0.05.The others: KEY +27%, HBAN +20%, BK +20%, STI +20%, COF +17%, DFS +15%, AXP +13%, STT +12%, JPM +11%, CMA +11%, PNC +9%, USB +9%, GS +9%, FITB +8%, WFC +7%, NTRS +6%, and no soup for BBT and MTB where the dividends are expected to be flat at $0.23 and $0.70 per share, respectively.As for ETFs, the dividend jumps are expected to have the biggest impact on the XLF which would see a 25% increase in payout: The ETF has 81 companies, but the top 5 holdings - BofA, Wells, JPM, Citi, USB - make up 41% of assets. In contrast, just two CCAR banks make up the top five holdings of the KBE and it should see a more muted increase of just 18%.Related ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, RKH, QABA, FNCL, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ Feb. 20, 2014, 3:29 PM | 13 Comments
Citi EMEA chief promises big things for Africa
Under particular pressure this year because of its exposure to emerging markets, Citigroup (C) isn't shying away from boosting investment in Africa. "We're counting on Africa to be a major contributor," says EMEA chief Jim Cowles, boasting of "a new strategic plan for sub-Saharan Africa."Citi isn't alone: Barclays last month said it plans to extend brokerage, trading, and other services available in South Africa to the rest of the continent, while UBS' wealth management division is targeting clients in oil-rich Nigeria and Angola.Cowles' comments come as Citi CEO Corbat has recently said the bank should no longer be expected to be everything to everyone everywhere. Corbat, of course, was CEO for EMEA before being elevated to the top job at the bank. Feb. 19, 2014, 7:20 AM | 1 Comment
Citi bet on emerging markets not paying off
The good news on Citigroup's (C -0.7%) exposure to weakening emerging markets might be that it's already reflected in the stock price - off 5% YTD vs. JPMorgan -1%, Wells Fargo +1.3%, and BofA +7.1%.Over 40% of Citicorp revenue and earnings came from EM in 2013, says JPMorgan's Vivek Juneja, so expect declining revenues from slower EM trading activity, lower underwriting volumes, and weaker investment sale fees.If the weakness persists, says Juneja, you can throw in boosted credit losses as creating a further hit. Loan loss reserves at Citicorp are at currently at a relatively low level of 2.29%. Feb. 14, 2014, 12:07 PM | 4 Comments
New forex lawsuit parses data to make case
There have been a number of suits against the global banks over claims of forex manipulation, but this latest by the City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement is the first to include research highlighting unusual movements in major currencies.Using data compiled by Fideres, the plaintiffs analyzed daily trading right around the 4 PM fix of currency prices ... curiously, anomalous price movements became rarer and less pronounced after the initial reports of rigging surfaced last summer.Morgan Stanley has spent some time looking at euro/dollar spikes at 4 PM and also concluded they were unrelated to economic events. Instead of collusion though, Morgan pins the blame on computerized trading programs.The seven banks sued by Philadelphia which is seeking damages as high as $10B: Barclays (BCS), Citigroup (C), Deutsche Bank (DB), HSBC, JPMorgan (JPM), RBS, and UBS.

Citi added to BAML's U.S. 1 Focus List
"We believe bank stocks deserve to trade below tangible book if: 1) balance sheet risk threatens TBV; or 2) it can't earn its cost of capital. We think Citigroup (C +1.1%) will disprove these worries over the next 12 months," writes analyst Erica Najarian. "We believe the pullback in the stock has created an especially compelling entry point for investors."The bank trades for 0.9x Dec. 31 tangible book value of $55.38, and at 8.4x consensus 2015 earnings - among the cheapest ratios for all U.S. bank stocks, and the only big-cap bank trading at less than tangible book.At root of this is Citi's exposure to struggling emerging markets - last year 56% of bank revenue and 62% of adjusted net income came from outside of the States. Najarian's team ran brutal scenarios occurring all at once in Mexico, Hong Kong, Korea, and India - and came up with just a 7% hit to EPS, but continued growth in TBV.There's also increased deployment of excess capital to look forward to - mainly share repurchases - thanks to the continued wind-down of (capital-intensive) Citi Holdings assets and the recapture of the DTA.

Citi looks to jump-start U.K. investment banking business
Looking to catch up to its rivals in investment banking in the U.K., Citigroup (C -2.3%) turns to one of its most experienced London bankers, hiring James Bardrick to lead operations in that country, reports the FT. He's currently co-head of corporate and investment banking for EMEA.Citi ranked just 8th last year in the U.K. deal scene, and is 14th so far in 2014. This is in contrast to Europe overall, where the bank rose to 5th last year from 10th previously after brining in a number of rainmakers.Bardrick will also have the pleasure of dealing with U.K regulators at a time of high scrutiny for banks.

Citi removed from Wells' Priority list
Concerns about the slow-motion meltdown in emerging markets have Wells Fargo removing Ciitgroup (C -0.4%) from its Priority List, but the team maintains an Outperform on the stock thanks to continued progress towards a 10%+ ROTCE by mid-2015, resilient (they've stopped tumbling) interest margins, and improved capital returns, not to mention an attractive valuation.However, says analyst Matthew Burnell, emerging markets account for half of Citi's franchise. "While the individual impact of such potential events appears manageable, collectively they could present a material headwind to EPS in the near term." Jan. 30, 2014, 11:09 AM
Citi's Argentine exposure "manageable" says KBW
Boiling Citigroup's (C -1.2%) exposure to an imploding Argentina to a worst-case scenario, KBW's Fred Cannon estimates a write-off of the bank's entire Argentine subsidiary would cost is $0.17 per share, or $0.12 if given credit for foreign currency forwards (Citi earned $0.83 last Q). As for the hit to book value, Cannon sees it as just $0.45 per share (worst case) vs. TBV of $55.38 at year's end.The bank won't disclose year-end exposure to the country until its annual report is filed, but as of September 30, net investment - the equity supporting $4.2B in assets in that country - was $750M.

Regulators ease Basel leverage ratio requirements
The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has eased the way banks will have to report leverage ratios, or the amount of capital they hold against their loans and other assets.The regulations will not force banks to count 100% of their off-balance-sheet assets, such as much of their exposure to derivatives, and guarantees and letters of credit.That alterations will lower the need for banks to sell assets or raise capital to meet the Basel leverage-ratio requirements, which might be set at 3% or higher from 2018.The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index is +1.5%.Major banks: RBS, HSBC, BCS, DB, CS, UBS, GS, JPM, C, MS, WFC, USB, BK, SAN, BBVA, LYG, NMR ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, EUFN, IPF, SEF, IAT, IYG, PFI, FXO, IXG, KBWB, KME, RKH, QABA, KRU, FINU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, FNCL, PSCF, AXFN, KRS, FINZ, EMFN, KBWX Jan. 13, 2014, 5:09 AM | 2 Comments

Nomura likes BofA and Citi as it starts coverage
"Multi-year capital/cost initiatives have prepared Bank of America (BAC) for a tougher capital regime, and its strong position supports meaningfully higher payouts vs. peers, in our view," says analyst Steven Chubak, initiating coverage with a Buy and $19 price target."BAC's current business mix, improving efficiency, and higher rate sensitivity should support ~15% mid-cycle returns (on required capital) by 2016. Legal costs should remain elevated, but analysis suggests BAC is only moderately under-reserved for remaining Private Label exposure. Long-term ROE potential of ~15% supports PT of $19, or 14% potential upside.""We see unparalleled ROE potential at Citigroup (C) under the new capital rules, as Citicorp efficiency targets are realized by 2015 and Citi Holdings turns profitable," he says, starting the bank at a Buy with $70 price target."We also see significant excess capital generation/best-in-class payout potential as the drag from Holdings moderates and DTA utilization accelerates.

Merrill Lynch unveils its top 10 stocks to buy for 2014
BofA Merrill Lynch is a more cautious buyer of stocks after this year's gains, and its top 10 large-cap stocks to buy for 2014 are mostly under-owned and unloved on Wall Street: ADM, Caterpillar (CAT), CenturyLink (CTL), Citigroup (C), Cisco (CSCO), DaVita (DVA), Exxon (XOM), GM, NextEra Energy (NEE) and Nucor (NUE).On CAT, the Lynch analysts point to high foreign sales prospects for 2014, and see strength in energy-related profits offsetting weakness in global mining; the firm has a $100 price target vs. ~$90 consensus.XOM is considered inexpensive compared to many large-cap energy names, it is expected to continue its large share buyback program and should increase the dividend; Lynch's target is $110 vs. $96 consensus.NUE is the ultimate contrarian play, as Wall Street is underwhelmed by steel stocks, but Lynch sees a rebound in commercial building as a big boost for 2014 earnings; the firm has a $60 target vs. $55 consensus.

The Too Big To Fail banks lead to the downside amid a report the set-to-be-voted on Volcker rule will not contain language allowing portfolio hedging - trades supposedly designed to protect against losses in a broad portfolio of assets.Banks can thank JPMorgan's (JPM -1.7%) London Whale fiasco for this as the Whale's trades were ostensibly set up for this portfolio hedging, but ended up costing the bank $6B.The move is a big blow to the banks which had sent their big lobbying guns in to try and prevent the disallowing of this practice. Banks often hedge to offset risks from trading with clients, but often there is no great hedge, and this is where portfolio hedging comes in ... or used to."Volcker has morphed a bit, thanks to the Whale," says UBS' Brennan Hawken. "Now a big component of it has become about hedging. What can you hedge, and what can't you? It's really unclear." The CFTC and SEC are each set to vote on the rule on Dec. 10.Citigroup (C -1.9%), Bank of America (BAC -1.2%), Goldman Sachs (GS -1%), Morgan Stanley (MS -2.2%). Dec. 5, 2013, 12:01 PM | 32 Comments
DOJ plans more MBS fraud cases in New Year
The Department of Justice intends to bring cases against several financial institutions next year for what it says is mortgage-bond fraud, Attorney General Eric Holder told Reuters yesterday.While Holder said that the DOJ would use JPMorgan's $13B agreement as a template, he didn't provide details about which banks are in his crosshairs.Firms that have acknowledged that they are under investigation include Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

Citi and Morgan Stanley lose Buy ratings at Deutsche
"Given our bias for some dislocation in credit markets near term, further meaningful upside in bank stocks seems less likely. As a result, we are getting more defensive for now," says Deutsche analyst Matt O'Connor, downgrading Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to Hold amid the coming taper and then end of QE.While P/E expansion for the banks in 2014 is probable should economic growth pick up and rates remain low (on a relative basis), says O'Conner, "we worry about the potential combination of widening credit spreads and rising interest rates."Citi is off 1% and Morgan 1.2% AH.This morning: Goldman removes Citi from its Conviction Buy list.

Banks cited for non-compliance with mortgage settlement
Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C -1.3%), and JPMorgan (JPM +0.5%) each failed at least 2 of 29 metrics used to gauge compliance with the national $25B mortgage settlement, according to a court filing from Joseph Smith, the watchdog overseeing the process. The last report - filed in June - cited JPM, Citi, and Wells Fargo for missing on 3 metrics.The failures stem from the complexity of the banks' systems, says Smith, and fixes can be expensive, but all the banks have implemented plans to address to issues.In one example, BofA failed on one test as to whether loans were actually delinquent at the time foreclosure was initiated, and another about how quickly it was notifying borrowers of missing documents in their loan modification applications.

Citi gets 2-notch downgrade from Goldman
Goldman cashes in its chips on its Conviction Buy call of Citigroup (C), downgrading 2 notches to Hold after a 27% move for the stock since being added to the list at the start of the year.Other than the outsized capital returns, all of the other catalysts for owning the stock have been priced in, says analyst Richard Ramsden. "With the introduction of much more onerous capital rules for large-cap banks (LCR, Basel 3 CCAR, supplementary leverage ratio), we see risk that Citi's capital return story will be more muted in the near term than we had previously expected."Shares -1% premarket Dec. 4, 2013, 7:24 AM | 1 Comment
EU Commission fines banks €1.71B for rate-rigging
As flagged, the EU Commission has fined international banks €1.71B for the manipulation of inter-bank interest rates, including.The banks fined are Citigroup (C) [€70M], Deutsche Bank (DB) [€726M], Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) [€391M], JPMorgan (JPM) [€79.9M] and Societe Generale (SCGLF) [€446M].UBS (UBS), Barclays (BCS) and Citigroup helped expose the cartels and so received immunity for their violations. UBS avoided a fine of €2.5B and Barclays €690M, while Citigroup's was €55M lower as a result.The EU has opened proceedings against HSBC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole (CRARF), as well as against JPMorgan (JPM), for Euribor infractions. JPM's fine is for Tibor violations. (PR) Dec. 4, 2013, 5:51 AM | 2 Comments
EU to fine banks €1.7B for manipulating interest rates
The EU Commission will reportedly fine a group of leading multinational banks €1.7B for rigging inter-bank interest rates in what would be the largest antitrust penalty that the commission has ever levied.The banks to be fined include all the old favorites - Citigroup (C), Deutsche Bank (DB), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), JPMorgan (JPM) and Barclays (BCS), as well as Societe Generale (SCGLF).The banks have admitted liability in return for a 10% reduction in their punishment.However, HSBC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole (CRARF) are contesting the proposed sanctions from the EU and are set to be formally charged today.UBS (UBS), which paid $1.5B to U.S. and U.K. authorities for similar sins, is escaping a penalty, as it alerted the EU to the Libor and Tibor cases.EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is due to announce the penalties at a press conference at 5:30 ET.

Banks about to get clarity on prop trading
The CFTC sets a December 10 vote on the so-called Volcker rule which is supposed to ban banks from prop trading. It sounded so simple when politicians trumpeted it in 2010, but the reality of what banks do is slightly more complex and the text of the rule has mushroomed to 1K pages. GS, MS, JPM, BAC, and C, among others, will be eager to see what the regulations entail.Any hopes for a watering-down of the rule likely ended with JPMorgan's $6B London Whale loss.The SEC indicates it will act on the rule around the same time as the CFTC (3 other agencies must approve as well).Related ETFs: FAS, XLF, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IAI, IYG, PFI, FXO, KBWB, KCE, RWW, FINU, RYF, PSCF, FNCL, FINZ, KBWC Dec. 3, 2013, 3:50 PM | 8 Comments
Banks expect to make mortgages outside of new standard
The nation's largest retail banks - WFC, BAC, C, and JPM - all expect to originate mortgages beginning in January falling outside of the standards mandated by Washington. To review, Dodd-Frank doesn't prohibit mortgages not meeting the definition of a so-called qualified mortgage (as defined by the CFPB), but banks can face greater legal liability on those loans.The impact of the new rules has yet to be seen, but the worry is they would curtail lending at the exact time when it ought to be encouraged. At this point, the bank's lending outside of these standards looks like it will be mostly to affluent customers (jumbo mortgages), and not a large proportion of total activity. Wells estimates about 5% of its lending this year wouldn't fall within QM guidelines.Wells' EVP of home mortgages Brad Blackwell: "It's clear the borrowers we're lending to today have an ability to repay ... We don't see a significant reason to contract our lending...because these are very high-quality borrowers."Deutsche estimates 13% of jumbo loans made since 2010 wouldn't be "qualified" mortgages.

Citi and Wells top picks from Guggenheim
The father-son analyst team of Marty and Mason Mosby believe Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have 25% upside over the next 12 months, compared to less than 10% for a number of other banks they follow, and just 5% for the S&P 500 index.Wells is better-positioned to handle the mortgage transition (from refis to purchases) than the market is giving it credit for, say the Mosbys, and Citi's capital markets business is poised to rebound this quarter and next year's Q1.

DOJ to scale back CDS investigation without charges
After four years of trawling through trading data, messages, emails and documents about credit-default swaps, the Department of Justice is reportedly winding down an investigation into allegations of anti-competitive behavior in the $24.3T market for credit-default swapsProsecutors had scrutinized Markit and the major banks that control the trading-data provider, including Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS).The banks, which act as dealers, were accused of conspiring to stop exchanges and other outsiders from participating in the market.The DOJ's move comes amid new regulations that are designed to increased competition.However, the probe remains open and prosecutors are continuing to monitor an investigation in the EU.

Insurers vie for lucrative Asian distribution deal with Citi
Metlife (MET), Prudential (PUK) and Manulife (MFC) are among five insurers bidding to form a bancassurance distribution partnership with Citigroup (C) in 14 Asian markets in a deal that could generate over $10B of revenue over 15 years.The winning insurer will make an exclusivity payment of $1.5-2B to Citigroup and split the sales with the U.S. bank. In return, the insurer will gain access to Citigroup's 600 branches and more than 34M consumer accounts.Citigroup is likely to choose just one firm to work with, although there is a small chance it could choose two.The other competing insurers are AIA Group (AAIGF) and FWD Group.

CCAR to be tougher in 2014, but banks in better shape too
American Express (AXP +0.4%), Discover (DFS +0.3%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.2%), and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.1%) are best positioned to be allowed large capital returns (about 70%) after the Fed's early 2014 stress tests, says Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch, while Ciitgroup (C +0.2%) and PNC Financial (PNC +0.9%) are likely to show the biggest improvement from last year.Overall, his team expects large cap bank capital returns to be 65% next year vs. about 48% in 2013. The median dividend payout ratio is expected at 22%, level with this year.Orenbuch notes the CCAR will be tougher this time around - notably by assuming a global, not just domestic meltdown, and assuming a significant reversal in the property market - with commercial real estate exposure particularly harshly judged.Balanced against that and likely winning, however, are far stronger capital positions of the banks, says Orenbuch.Financial and banking ETFs: FAS, XLF, FAZ, UYG, KRE, KBE, VFH, IYF, IPF, SEF, IAI, IAT, IYG, FXO, PFI, IXG, KBWB, RKH, QABA, KCE, FINU, RWW, KRU, RYF, KBWR, AXFN, PSCF, KRS, FNCL, FINZ, KBWX, KBWC Nov. 27, 2013, 1:42 PM | 1 Comment
Additional legal tab for banks could exceed $100B
"Mortgage-related litigation has recently gotten a second wind and has expanded beyond investor claims,” says S&P, now estimating legal tab for U.S. banks could be another $56.5B-$104B. The good news is banks have gotten ahead of even these crazy numbers by boosting litigation reserves to nearly $155B.The bad news would be if Bank of America's (BAC) $8.5B mortgage settlement with private parties gets tossed out by a federal judge (see Article 77 hearing coverage), the litigation losses could "escalate significantly ...  the ability of US banks with the largest exposures to withstand additional expenses is not unlimited.”C, WFC, MS, JPM, and GS declined to comment for the story.From the Department of Legal Issues Are Going Nowhere: The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh - claiming its losses of more than $1B are not covered by the JPMorgan global settlement - asks a judge to force JPM to turn over the draft complain from the DOJ which includes the name of a bank employee described as a cooperating witness for the government.Related ETFs: FAS, XLF, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IAI, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, KCE, FINU, RWW, RYF, PSCF, FNCL, FINZ, KBWC Nov. 27, 2013, 9:22 AM | 7 Comments

Citigroup dealt blow in $2B Abu Dhabi suit
U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel has rebuffed Citigroup (C) and ruled that arbitrators and not federal judges can decide whether the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) can seek a second arbitration in a dispute over the sovereign wealth fund's $7.5B investment in the bank in late 2007.ADIA is seeking $2B in damages or to rescind the investment, for which it received a 4.9% stake in Citibank, which needed the cash six years ago to help shore up its finances following writedowns for sub-prime mortgages.ADIA is claiming breach of contract, and breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Citibank issued preferred shares to other investors that diluted ADIA's stake.ADIA lost the first arbitration decision two years ago. Nov. 26, 2013, 4:38 AM
Banks ban traders from chat rooms
“The bank clamped down on this big time. I think we were even going slightly overboard on this,” says one senior banker after a number of lenders including Barclays (BCS), Citigroup (C), and RBS banned the use of most chat rooms amid probes into rate manipulation.Most of the rooms in question are those where traders from competing banks participate - it's these on paper conversations where investigators are likely to draw the fuel for their anti-competitive practice charges.

What worries David Tepper?

I"m worried by long/short friends are going to lose their jobs." Can markets correct 5-10% amid the taper? Of course.Of his J.C. Penney (JCP) stake, he's pleased with the big move higher over the past month, but it's strictly a trade on a stock that had gone down too far too fast. He remains long Citigroup (C) and calls it a $70 stock.Talking a bit more about his Treasury call, he says he's short even though he considers it an impossibility for the 10-year Treasury to get over 3.5%-3.75%. "I'd bet anything on that."The 10-year/2-year Treasury spread is at 251 basis points, within shouting distance of the record 292 basis points.

A check of the stocks of the downgraded banks (GS, JPM, MS, BK) finds them snoozing through the news. Goldman is off 0.4% premarket, but it's one trade for 56 shares. The others have no premarket action. A look at the lender's bond yields finds them little-affected as well.A far larger issue is U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder calling the rate-fixing we know about so far "the tip of the iceberg," as U.S. regulators pile into a currency-trading investigation.

CS: Investors may want to dial back bank capital return hopes
New CCAR guidelines are largely inline with last year, says the team at Credit Suisse, but some variables pose more onerous assumptions and could keep capital distributions more conservative than otherwise expected, though still improved from last year.The incorporation of a large counterparty default scenario is particularly of note for those banks with material trading and custodial operations. The bar for CCAR passage is thus raised for: BAC, BK, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, and WFC.Additionally, the weakening of economic activity in the severely adverse scenario appears worse than last year. Also included is a reversal in the recent improvement in U.S. housing and the European economy.Those best-positioned for excess capital deployment: AXP, HBAN, KEY, NTRS, RF, and USB.

The deal is not yet sealed and if Citi doesn't renew, it would leave SL Green needing to fill the entire 2.6M square foot property.The deal would be a nice get for SL Green at a time when the financial services industry is shrinking, and millions of square feet formerly occupied by Citi's big bank brethren are now on the market.

Citi backs wider tick size experiment
Saying the move "would help enhance liquidity," Citigroup (C) - in a letter to the SEC - proposes a one-year pilot program testing the pricing of stocks in nickels or dimes instead of pennies.The letter comes as those in the industry and regulators talk about adjusting tick sizes for less-frequently traded stocks, and Citi is one of Wall Street's largest market-making firms. Stocks only shifted from trading in "teenies" to pennies in 2001."In some cases, increasing the minimum quoting increment from a penny to a nickel makes sense; in other cases, increasing the increment to a dime (depending on average daily volume traded and stock price) or even a quarter (particularly for very high-prices securities) may be warranted."

Report: CFTC ups pressure on banks in currency investigation
As part of the global probe into possible currency-market manipulation, the CFTC has the major fx-dealing banks scouring their records in order to hand over any evidence of wrongdoing to the agency, reports the WSJ. Deutsche Bank (DB) and Citigroup (C) are among those so-ordered and Deutsche - according to an insider - is spending millions going through emails and chat sessions. Sources say neither lender has yet handed over any material to the CFTC.Earlier this month, the chairman of Credit Suisse (CS) told a Swiss newspaper his bank was combing through records in connection with the investigation and had thus far found "no evidence of malpractice."The key issue is the foreign-exchange fixes at 4 PM London time, off of which is based a wide range of other rates and securities pricing.Any examination of banter among traders is sure to turn up a good deal of pejorative language and information-sharing among participants - none of which would be unusual or necessarily illegal. The investigation will turn on whether regulators feel such color crosses the line into inappropriate disclosure, says a source close to Citi's internal investigation.Previous: A group of traders from competing firms were known in the chat rooms as "The Bandits Club," or "The Cartel."

Taking first place for the sector expected to perform best is - what else - tech.WIth 91% of managers in agreement, Sears (SHLD) tops the list of most-hated stocks. Next at 87% is Tesla (TSLA). After that with 80% Is Herbalife (HLF), followed closely by ZIllow (Z) and Netflix (NFLX).Apple (AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) top the list of most-loved stocks with 70%, followed by Citibank (C) at 60%.Broad fixed-income ETFs: AGG, BND, LAG, SCHZ, BOND, SAGG, MINC.Broad equity exposure ETFs: IYY, VTI, EXT, TOTS, EUSA, ITOT.Utility ETFs: IDU, PUI, XLU, VPU, RYU, FXU, PSCU, UPW, SDP, UTLT.

Mayo a fan of Citi under Corbat
"Nobody's been more negative on C than me," says CLSA's Mike Mayo one year after Mike Corbat took over as CEO, and after yesterday's earnings report. "I can say that Citi is now more on the right long-term track than at anytime in the past decade."Mayo spent much of his time on yesterday's earnings call (transcript) wondering where future operating leverage is going to come from. The bank has nearly hit its targeted savings level, he notes, but revenues came down even faster last quarter. Management urges patience, arguing to judge the program a year from now rather than on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Oct. 16, 2013, 1:28 PM | 1 Comment
Progress at Citi Holdings detailed during earnings call
Assets at Citi Holdings are down to 6% of total Citigroup (C +0.4%) assets from 9% a year ago (presentation slide #15), says management on the earnings call (live on Seeking Alpha). Net credit losses of $635M fell from $1.8B a year ago, and the drag on bank income fell to just $102M from $670M a year ago. The amount of mortgages past due fell to $4.97B from $8.29B a year ago.Turning to Citigroup, the higher interest rates didn't yet make an impact, with net interest margin slipping to 2.81% in Q3 from 2.85% in Q2, and 2.88% at the start of the year.A focus of questioning early in the call is on the unexpected build in loan-loss reserves, and management says it's related to about $300M in exposure to three Mexican home builders amid two hurricanes that hit in September.In a pre-call call with reporters, CFO John Gerspach says Citi no longer holds any Treasury paper coming due on October 31 or earlier, adding that his bank isn't the only lender dumping its short-term bills. "We're in uncharted waters."Earlier: Q3 results. Oct. 15, 2013, 11:53 AM | 1 Comment
As expected, Citi revenues hit by slow mortgage and trading business
Global consumer banking revenues fell 7% Y/Y to $9.2B, led by a 12% decline in North America (slow mortgage banking). Securities and banking revenues fell 2% to $4.7B, led (as tipped off by the company a month ago) by a whopping 26% decline in fixed income revenue. Citicorp expenses of $10.3B fell 6%. CEO Corbat: "While many of the factors which influence our revenues are not within our full control, we certainly can control our costs."Citi Holdings revenue of $1.3B up 28% Y/Y as improving housing led to less need for repurchase reserve builds. More importantly, assets declined 29% to $122B and now represent just 6% of Citigroup assets.Tangible book value per share of $54.52, up 3% Y/Y. Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.6%.Conference call live on Seeking Alpha at 11 ET.C -0.7% premarket. Oct. 15, 2013, 8:12 AM | 2 Comments

Citi fined over early release of Apple report
In one of the biggest fines for improper research practices in a decade, Citigroup (C) will pay $30M to settle (with the state of Massachusetts) allegations an analyst leaked negative information about Apple and a supplier to four big investment shops before it was released to the public. This follows Citi last year paying $2M to Massachusetts for improperly feeding research to the media.Finra has its own ongoing investigation into the matter, according to sources, and Massachusetts authorities are continuing to investigate the analyst as well as those firms which allegedly received the information - SAC Capital, T. Rowe Price (TROW), CItadel, and GLG Partners.T. Rowe Price says an internal review showed it engaged in no trading on material nonpublic information. Oct. 3, 2013, 11:41 PM | 3 Comments

Citigroup next target for government after JPMorgan?
After the government is done relieving JPMorgan shareholders of something in the area of $11B, Citigroup (C -0.5%) could be the next target, suggests Charles Peabody. U.S. Attorney General Holder has already said to expect announcements aimed at banks other than the House of Dimon, and Citigroup makes for a plump target.Citigroup's litigation costs since 2008 have summed to $8.1B - chicken feed compared to about $20B for both JPMorgan and BofA. The government may just want to bring that more into line. Citigroup has upped its legal cost reserve from $4B to $5B In the past year.

Earnings at top five banks seen taking major hit
Analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the top five U.S. banks by over $1B in total, due to increasing fears about a sharp fall in trading revenue - especially from fixed-income operations - and higher legal costs.JPMorgan (JPM) has been particularly affected, with consensus for net income down $526M to below $5B. The company's legal woes are seen adding $2B to expenses.Analysts have lowered their net income for Bank of America (BAC) by $128M, for Goldman Sachs (GS) by $123M, for Morgan Stanley (MS) by $97M, and for Citigroup (C) by $210M. The latter has already reportedly told investors about a sharp drop in trading revenues.Banks had hoped a big September would help offset a slow summer, but that hasn't happened.

China opens Shanghai Free Trade Zone
China has officially opened the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ), which the government sees as a major step in liberalizing the country's economy and enacting other reforms.The FTZ will be used as a place to test those reforms, such as with the convertibility of the yuan.Twenty-five companies have received approval to establish operations in the zone, including Citigroup (C). Banks are expected to have more leeway in setting interest rates, while foreign institutions will be able to issue bonds in the domestic market. The government also intends to create an international oil futures trading platform.Overseas firms will be able to manufacture video-game consoles in the FTZ and sell them in China.ETFs - Stocks: FXI, GXC, PGJ, YAO, FCHI, PEK, CAF, YXI, XPP, FXP, MCHI, YINN, YANG, TCHI, CHXF, KFYP, HAO, ECNS.

No sugarcoating it: Mayo likes Morgan Stanley
'Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley, and Morgan Stanley" are Mike Mayo's top 3 picks among the banks. MS is double over the last year and it's a double again over the next three, he says.Of the dip in trading revenue report from Citi which hit the banks yesterday, Mayo says it's old news - fixed income trading has been going down for years and a continued fall is already in Mayo's models. Any revisions lower are little more than "noise," and will be a blip on the screen a few months from now. Morgan Stanley gets just 15% of revenue from fixed-income trading - sluggishness in this area is no excuse not to own the stock, says Mayo."Revenues stink in the banking industry," he allows, and that's why he likes Morgan Stanley (and Citigroup C as well) - "the restructuring story can cut through the revenue weakness."What about Bank of America (BAC) which has moved nearly tick for tick with Morgan Stanley this year? Morgan has more levers, says Mayo, particularly in Wealth Management after its purchase of Smith Barney from Citigroup.

Citigroup's warning on trading revenue hits Goldman
Citigroup (C) slips 1% in the premarket after its weekend "pre-announcement" of a big fall in FICC revenue in Q3. The bank had been hoping to get bailed out by a big September, but the Fed's non-taper last week squelched the chance of major portfolio moves by clients.Anybody paying attention surely noticed last week's evaporation of profit at Jefferies (now owned by Leucadia) as fixed-income trading revenue essentially disappeared.Deutshce Bank (DB) is expected to soon be out with a warning similar to Citibank's. Barclays (BCS) and Credit Suisse (CS) have already waved their own red flags over this issue.Not yet heard from are Goldman (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan (JPM), and BofA (BAC), but Goldman is also off nearly 1% premarket.

Bank of America's (BAC -0.6%) operating earnings could hit $1.72 per share in 2015 from $1.01 this year, says analyst Murali Gopal, initiating the stock with a Buy (initially reported yesterday). Cost savings, reserve releases, and a strong capital markets business leave the bank "uniquely placed" for sustained outperformance.Also started at Buy is Citigroup (C -0.6%) as rising home prices could boost Citi Holdings - the unit into which the bank's legacy assets have been placed. Better earnings should also allow the recapture of Citi's $45B deferred tax asset. He sees 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.31 vs. $4.93 this year.JPMorgan (JPM +0.7%) is started at Hold because of the regulatory target on its back, with 2015 EPS expected to rise to just $6.25 in 2015 from $5.88 this year.Wells Fargo (WFC -0.6%) also rates just a hold because of the bank's heavy exposure to the slowing mortgage market.

Chanos remains bearish on China and those that supply it
Don't draw any conclusions against the sale of his entire stake in JPMorgan (JPM), Jim Chanos tells Bloomberg. It was a hedge against his shorting of a number of Chinese banks (ETF: CHIX). He reminds he's still long Citigroup (C) against the Chinese shorts. "Our business is still shorting ... China has been a bright spot."Having said that, Chanos is finding himself enamored of a tech stock he originally purchased as a hedge: Samsung (SSNLF.PK, SSNGY.OB).Back in China, Chanos says the country's credit system has "gone crazy" - new debt is growing at 30-40% of GDP per year vs. about 10% nominal GDP growth (and Chanos doesn't buy the GDP numbers). Other than Chinese banks, Chanos remains short CAT along with a number of others which benefitted from the global materials boom.

Headcount since then was off 6K to about 253K as of the end of June.Bank of America and Wells Fargo have also been busy cutting back mortgage staff, though BofA's reduction are as much about improving credit - less need for servicing staff - as about the refi slowdown.

Analyst: Worst case MBS scenario for banks is manageable
Worst-case estimates of legal losses stemming from pre-crisis mortgage sales at the three largest U.S. banks "are clearly manageable," says Drexel Hamilton's David Hilder. His conclusion comes after studying "reasonably possible losses" in the Q2 filings of BAC, C, JPM, and WFC."Initial estimates of mortgage-related losses and litigation settlement costs were too low ... at this point, more than 5 years since the mortgage-driven parts of the crisis began to explode ... we believe the banks' estimates ... are likely to be more accurate than externally-derived estimates."Hilder's view is the consensus one, but (surprise) CLSA's Mike Mayo says Bank of American faces billions more in potential losses owing to the challenge to its $8.5B settlement to resolve $107B in investor losses. The Article 77 hearing over that matter resumes on September 9 following a summer recess. Sep. 3, 2013, 2:10 PM

Zero down mortgages preserved in new rule
Maybe a victory for prospective homeowners, but certainly a victory for anyone dependent upon a speedy housing market, the new proposal for the Qualified Residential Mortgage rule (QRM) is quite a bit less-restrictive than the original version.The new standard would allow a no downpayment option similar to that allowed by the CFPB - that rule protects banks from being sued by mortgage investors on zero-down loans as long as the borrower's debt to income ratio is less than 43%.The new plan also requires banks to hold onto a slice of mortgages (for those with less than 20% down) when debt/income is above 43% as opposed to 36% in the initial proposal.The agencies will await public comment before a vote on the final rule.Homebuilders, mortgage bankers, and realtors look on with interest.Related: WFC, BAC, C, JPM, XHB, ITB, RLGY.

Credit-card firms angle for new business with 0% teasers
0% balance transfers are nothing new, but today's teasers come with unusually lengthy periods - up to 2 years - and are being offered to a wider swath of customers than in the past, say industry executives (anyone who lived through the last credit cycle will find that hard to believe).Naturally, it comes with a catch, and lenders make money by charging a one-time transfer fee - typically 3%. Kudos to the credit card operators for slipping "0%" by regulators, while charging 3%.While JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Discover (DFS) are among those aggressively going after the business, American Express (AXP) CEO Ken Chenault isn't a fan. "Putting out a substantial number of 0% offers doesn't appear to target the affluent prospects some competitors claim to be after, nor is it a net revenue driver over the short term," he told investors earlier this month.The others claim the practice allows them to grow their loan portfolios after they shrank dramatically in wake of the financial crisis.

Banks scale back as rates business slows
"Rates businesses could have lower revenues over the next few years as European sovereign opportunities recede," says Citigroup (C) global head of rates Andrew Morton.Revenues in rates trading at investment banks fell 36% in H1, according to research group Coalition. It's a big move in a segment which has become the banks' most lucrative since the financial crisis and makes up 20% of overall revenue, according to Boston Consulting Group."We expect revenues and headcount productivity to sharply decline as the business moves to more efficient trading venues," says Deutsch's Matt Spick. Those with the biggest market share like Citigroup, Barclays (BCS), and Deutsche (DB) should cope better than smaller rivals like Credit Suisse (CS), which has already cut capital allocated to the business and has announced more cuts are on the way.

Larry Summers is a paid adviser to Citigroup (C), Nasdaq (NDAQ) and other financial firms, positions that could count against him in the race to be the next Chair of the Fed. On the other hand, Summers is also close to Barack Obama, having helped prep the latter when he was a presidential candidate during the financial crisis of 2008 and having served in his administration. It's a relationship that Janet Yellen doesn't have.

Leverage from cost cuts and improving mortgage delinquency trends have him preferring Citi to the Bank of Dimon, but he thinks Morgan Stanley (MS) can double again over the next three years. "They are going to be on the cover of every business magazine in the country." Mayo in May gave a big upgrade to MS after CEO Gorman promised a 10% ROE by 2014.

Ciitgroup (C +1.1%) gives up some of a larger premarket gain as the earnings call moves into the Q&A (presentation slides). As with JPMorgan and Wells on Friday, spread compression (Citi's fell 3 bps to 2.85%, page 23) and slowing in mortgages has management cautious. There's legal issues too: "I would expect legal costs to remain high and somewhat volatile," says CFO Gerspach. Citi Holdings is looking better. Of $131B in assets, $80B are mortgages, and delinquencies and credit losses are coming down (page 22-23).

The lawyers and hedge funders are out at Citigroup (C), and bankers are in charge for the first time since John Reed retired in 2000, writes Sandra Ward in a bullish Barron's piece. Distinguishing Citi from its peers is 58% of revenue coming internationally vs. JPM and BAC in the teens - a big edge with U.S. growth crimped by regulations and the economy. In the nearer term, shareholders should enjoy massive capital returns as toxic paper at Citi Holdings is wound down (CH has 8% of bank assets, but ties up 20% of capital), and growing profits allow the use of Citi's $55B in tax deferred assets.

Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, Republican counterpart John McCain and two others have introduced the "21st Century Glass-Steagall Act," a reprise of the 1930s law that was repealed in 1999 and that separated traditional banking such as home loans and checking accounts from riskier pursuits like investment banking and trading derivatives. Slogans such as "banking should be boring" and keep "keep the gamblers out of our banks" have a populist ring, but the legislation will face many hurdles.

If we don't see anything by September, then it's "Houston we got a problem," and Tepper hopes he's quicker on the sell button than everybody else.

Citigroup (C) gains on Deutsche Bank (DB) in the race for currency trading supremacy. C (which came in second in a Euromoney Institutional Investor poll), cut DB's market share lead to just 0.28%, which is about as tight as the race for the top spot has ever been. C's ascent is partially attributable to its strong showing in emerging-market foreign exchange, where it leads DB by more than 2 percentage points.

Citigroup's (C) reluctance to pare its mortgage assets at fire-sale prices could pay off, says KBW, as it now stands to greatly benefit from rising home prices. It's a flow vs. stock argument as Citi - compared to WFC, JPM, or USB - does a relatively small amount of (now under profit-pressure) mortgage origination volume, but still has loads of questionable paper on its books. Also positioned to benefit is BAC.

Richard Pzena (PZN) - still heavily overweight financials (XLF) and mature tech (XLK) - makes his case for global banks in today's earnings call (transcript): With capital levels of 11-13% at JPM, C, and BCS double what they were pre-crisis, will regulators allow banks to earn a decent return on said capital? A definite "yes," says Pzena, seeing no reason demand for financial products won't continue to grow faster than GDP, and noting bank managers' "laser-like focus" on improving returns. An average price-to-book ratio of 0.7x combined with a modest ROE of 12-13% suggests fair value more than double current prices.

The Brown/Vitter bill being rolled out in Congress is essentially Armageddon to the TBTF banks, says Goldman, seeing it as mandating another $1.1T in equity for the banking system. Banks would need 12 years of earnings to build this amount organically, though the bill would give just 5 - say goodbye to lending. Break up the banks?

Pandit and Havens joined Citigroup in 2007 when the bank bought their Old Lane hedge fund for $800M. The move should help Citi comply with the Volcker rule. Oct. 19, 2012, 3:55 PM

"Today's changes don't reflect any desire to alter strategic direction," says new Citigroup (C) CEO Mike Corbat, along with Chairman Mike O'Neill, currently holding a conference call (webcast). Why the changes then? As for selling businesses, Corbat says he will take a fresh look, but promises nothing. Both CRO Brian Leach and CFO John Gerspach "are committed" to staying.

The chance of sales of individual units of Citigroup (C) likely rose with Pandit's departure, says Sterne Agee's Todd Hagerman. Be more accessible/accountable to investors and analysts, asks Mike Mayo of the new management, wondering where the conference call with Michael Corbat is. Noting the new CEO is a 29-year Citi vet, Mayo wonders if any changes in bank culture will be forthcoming. Oct. 16, 2012, 3:31 PM
"It was my decision," Vikram Pandit tells the WSJ as he and the board - anonymously or otherwise - rush to get their version out of the issues surrounding his abrupt resignation from Citigroup (C). The board has reportedly had ousting Pandit on its agenda for months, upset by setbacks such as the rejection of the bank's dividend plan and the $2.9B writedown on Smith Barney.

Citigroup (C) looks to have missed the housing rebound and it may be the reason Pandit was forced out, writes Stephen Gandel.

Citigroup (C +5%) continues to climb following its earnings beat. Of interest on the conference call is CFO John Gerspach's caution on housing: "We are all seeing some elements of what I would call stabilization ...

Dimon: "We expect to continue to be challenged by high default-related expenses." Regulatory guidance (pg. 8 of the presentation) is forcing higher charge-offs - $825M, or $0.14/share in Q3 - on certain mortgage loans.

It's the usual suspects who stand to be affected by Fed Governor Tarullo's call to cap the size of banks' non-deposit liabilities. JPM, BAC, GS, and C all have ratios greater than 5% of U.S. GDP. Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are substantially below. "This is a major new direction for the Fed," says Simon Johnson. "There is agreement across the political spectrum ... (the banks) should be made smaller and simpler." Oct. 11, 2012, 4:41 PM | 4 Comments
With banks set to report Q3 earnings, regulators will have an eye on how much of a boost profits get by slashing reserves for bad loans. Perfectly legal, the action nevertheless gives an unsustainable boost to profit - it's accounted for 23% of the bottom line for TBTFs over the last year - making banks look healthier just at the time they've thinned cushions against the next downturn.

"They can't get rid of this rule fast enough," says a bank analyst of the FASB's progress toward eliminating the debt valuation adjustment (DVA) from bank earnings. The rule - which perversely adds to earnings as a bank's credit deteriorates (and subtracts from the bottom line as credit improves) - has been behind big whipsaws in reported numbers in recent quarters (Q3 will be no exception). "(It's) one of the more ridiculous concepts that's ever been invented in accounting," says Jamie Dimon.

Wall Street firms will likely reduce bonuses rather than cut jobs to control expenses this year, says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck. Compensation will probably drop from a year ago as banks attempt to avoid further headcount reductions after culling their ranks heavily last year, with most of the cuts coming from employee bonuses rather than base salaries. And bonuses, as we all know, represent a disproportionately large percentage of the income for Wall Street professionals.

Citigroup's (C) $4.7B writedown of its Morgan Stanley Smith Barney stake probably won’t reduce CEO Vikram Pandit's profit-sharing plan award, a sum that could total nearly $24M. Why? Because the plan doesn’t count losses at Citi Holdings, the dead-letter division that holds the company's toxic assets including the Smith Barney brokerage. Excluding the toxic assets, Pandit's plan - which was actually rejected by top shareholders when put to a vote - will record a pretax profit for 2011 and 2012, when the bank's shares actually tumbled.

Citigroup (C) has a credit card business worth $60B by itself, yet the entire bank is valued at $97B, says former Morgan Stanley CEO Phil Purcell (who spun off Discover during his reign), again making the case for breaking up the big banks. If banks are going to trade at half of book, but have business lines that would fetch 2-3X book, it's a no-brainer. "The shareholder is getting cheated." Sep. 13, 2012, 12:18 PM | 5 Comments

More structural than cyclical is S&P's view of weak Wall Street earnings. Return on equity at the major investment banks - usually 15% in okay times - was just 7% in 2011.

Bank stocks (XLF +3.7%) jump out of the starting gate after the central bank liquidity push, shrugging off the S&P downgrades: JPM +5.4%, MS +5.9%, C +5.3%.  Bank of America (BAC +5.3%) looks to avoid collapsing through $5, at least for another day - it's a line in the sand, not because it’s a round number, but because many fund managers will be forced to sell if it closes below that mark.

S&P went on a downgrade spree of banks yesterday, but no matter, they're surging premarket following the international central bank move to boost liquidity.

S&P's banking downgrade spree after the close - lowering nearly every sizable U.S. bank by one notch - may have been telegraphed as part of the agency’s application of its revised bank criteria. But that's not stopping prices from slipping AH: BAC -0.4%, MS -0.8%, C -0.4%, JPM -0.1%, WFC -0.1%, GS -0.1%. Oddly, several European banks were left unscathed - is there more to come?

The selloff from the opening pop in Bank of America (BAC -0.1%) accelerates, with the stock turning red while the rest of its banking brethren remain sharply higher. BofA was up more than 5% earlier. The big winner among the TBTFs is Citigroup (C +5.5%) despite having its slap of the wrist settlement with the SEC thrown out. Nov. 28, 2011, 2:59 PM | 1 Comment
The SEC fires back at Judge Rakoff who just threw out the agency's settlement with Citigroup (C) over punk mortgage securitizations. The Rakoff ruling "ignores decades of established practice throughout federal agencies and decisions of the federal courts." Established practice. Hello SEC, that's the issue.

Morgan Stanley cuts its outlook and price targets on big U.S. banks, citing economic concerns in the U.S. and Europe.

Citigroup's (C +5.8%) $285M settlement with the SEC over toxic mortgage debt is rejected by New York federal court judge Jed Rakoff as "neither fair, nor reasonable, nor in the public interest." A new trial is set for July 2012. Citigroup had agreed last month to settle an SEC claim that it misled investors in a $1B CDO linked to subprime residential mortgage securities.

Fed-up customers are set to yank $185B in deposited funds from U.S. banks in 2012. The four biggest - Chase (JPM), BofA (BAC), Citibank (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - could lose at least $135B if they can't find a way to woo new customers and keep existing ones from defecting.

Bank of America (BAC -3.4%) scrapes up against its 52-week low of $5.13 in line with a general selloff, but also suffering from the new round of stress tests announced by the Fed. The seemingly tough exam could force BofA into a large capital raise at just the time its stock price won't allow it (Soros' reflexivity comes to mind).

The Fed launches new bank stress tests in which lenders will be forced to model a severe eurozone recession - a 6.9% decline in real GDP - and a skying domestic unemployment rate. In addition, the 6 largest U.S. banks will need to estimate losses "stemming from a hypothetical global market shock," similar to that of late autumn 2008.

Todd Sullivan's look at investing in the big banks reveals the potential for "very healthy" double-digit returns, especially for Bank of America (BAC), whose litigation risk is "massively overstated... as if they will lose every case against them and be forced to pay the whole amount they are being sued for." While perceptions are dictating valuation for now, "over time fundamentals will win out." Nov. 17, 2011, 5:23 PM | 15 Comments
Google (GOOG) is expected to today launch an online music service in which it will sell songs from Sony (SNE), EMI (C), and Universal (VIVHY.PK).

Citigroup (C) could join the list of banks that are cutting staff, with the WSJ reporting that the bank is considering slashing 3,000 jobs, or around 1% of its workforce.

Vivendi’s (VIVHY.PK) Universal Music on Friday won the auction to buy EMI's recording division from Citigroup (C) for $1.9B, while a Sony (SNE) led consortium that includes Blackstone (BX) will acquire the publishing arm for $2.2B.

Vivendi’s (VIVHY.PK) Universal Music is closing in on EMI’s recorded music ops with a $1.9B offer, the FT reports, exceeding the $1.7B-$1.8B that Citigroup (C) was seeking and expected bids of $1.5B.

Citigroup (C) attempts to quell anger among Japan's regulators who are growing more impatient at what they see as an inability to fix problems that have led to three scandals in seven years.

Financial stocks (XLF +2.1%) are a primary source of leadership in the early going, as diversified players such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM +1%) and Citigroup (C +4.9%) rally on the back of aggressive buying.

Banks gave 5.4M subprime borrowers credit cards in H1, a 64% Y/Y increase, as lenders seek growth where they can find it. It's just a blip compared to the 14.7M cards issued in H1 2007, but the improving performance of recent credit card portfolios are making lenders more comfortable. Data suggest Citigroup (C) is leading the charge.

UBS is making a bullish call on Citigroup (C), arguing the banking giant's exposure to mortgage lawsuits, Euro sovereign debt, and the U.S. housing market don't "even get halfway" to justifying its cheap valuation. On the other hand, UBS thinks Bank of America's (BAC) low valuation is justified, given its outstanding loan portfolio is in much worse shape. Oct. 11, 2011, 10:08 AM

Markets sniff out weakness, and the relentless selling in financials may be no more than frontrunning John Paulson, whose Advantage Plus fund is reportedly off 47% through September's end. Redemptions - perhaps massive ones - are a possibility, meaning Paulson will have to unload financial shares, and others, he has been so fond of. One could do worse than picking a bottom in the XLF on the day he is forced to give up on the sector. Oct. 8, 2011, 8:44 PM | 12 Comments
The UBS rogue trader scandal prompts Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) to conduct "massive" examinations of their compliance procedures that monitor trading activities, Charlie Gasparino writes.

U.S. bank exposure to the European debt crisis is estimated at $640B, nearly 5% of total U.S. banking assets, according to recent research papers written for Congress - or "considerably higher" depending on exposure of nonbank institutions and through secondary channels.

The price of protection against default by Morgan Stanley (MS) has naturally risen the past few sessions.

It wasn't so long ago this was the norm.
