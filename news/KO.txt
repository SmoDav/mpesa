FDA updates nutrition labeling on packaged foods
The FDA has updated and modernized the Nutrition Facts labeling on packaged foods and beverages with the aim of better informing consumers about food choices that support a healthy diet.Key changes:Serving size and number of servings per container are more prominently displayed. Serving size updated to reflect what people actually eat and drink (as compared to the mouse-sized portions previously listed).The daily values for nutrients updated based on new scientific evidence. The daily values reflect amounts to consume or not to exceed. Data for %Daily Value make it easier for consumers to determine how much a nutrient in a serving contributes to a daily diet.Added sugars are now required on the label. Vitamin D and potassium are also required because many consumers fall short of the recommended amounts. Vitamins A & C are no longer required since deficiencies in these vitamins are rare today.Larger manufacturers have until July 26, 2018 to institute the new labeling requirements. Small businesses have an additional year to comply.Related tickers: (XLP)(VDC -0.1%)(FXG -0.6%)(IYK)(PBJ -0.6%)(PSCC -0.7%)(OTCPK:NSRGY -0.4%)(PG -0.2%)(UL -0.2%)(PEP +0.3%)(KO +0.3%)(GIS -0.1%)

Coca-Cola story wearing thin for analysts unmoved after Q4 results
Coca-Cola (KO -0.9%) extends yesterday's losses after below consensus guidance overshadowed better than expected Q4 revenues.Analysts are wary and seem content to wait on the sidelines, seeing too many short-term risks around KO even while the stock may be a good long-term bet.Cowen reiterates its Market Perform rating and $40 price target, saying KO’s outlook for 3% underlying sales growth "reflects another year of macro challenges... as key markets remain under pressure, and in some instances like Brazil are deteriorating."Gabelli reiterates its Hold rating, finding the current valuation fair considering "the challenging global demand environment, currency and structural headwinds over the next two years."Wells Fargo, which maintains a Market Weight rating and $42-$44 valuation range, says "the song remains the same" at KO, with declining volumes amid an ongoing overhaul of its bottler networks; "the unfortunate consequence of this multi-year [refranchsing] process is that it continues to delay the 're-base' year when earnings begin to grow again," the firm says.

Buffett exit from Coca-Cola board raises M&A intrigue
Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic says the focus on Coca-Cola (KO +2.7%) should be on the exit of Howard Buffett from the board (announced yesterday), instead of on today's news of the elevation of James Quincey to the CEO position. Howard's father, Warren Buffett, doesn't sit on the KO board.Zuanic reasons that the Buffett exit could make it easier for Berkshire Hathaway to divest its $16.6B position in Coca-Cola. That in turn could create a domino effect.Susquehanna note: "Would the proceeds help 3G/KHC fund a potential bid for, say, MDLZ? Would selling out of KO mean that 3G is ultimately not interested on buying KO, and that their ultimate target is PEP? Food for thought."Previously: Coca-Cola CEO to step down (Dec. 9)Previously: Coca-Cola higher after appointing new CEO (Dec. 9)Previously: Ripple effect from Coca-Cola CEO move (Dec. 9) Dec. 9, 2016, 1:09 PM | 38 Comments

Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic warns that Coca-Cola (KO -1.8%), PepsiCo (PEP -1.9%) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD -2.3%) have some peso risk now embedded due to the sharp drop in the currency. Details from his note to investors are posted below.BUD: "In 2015 Mexico accounted for 12% of BUD EBITDA, but now including SAB it will account for 8-9%."KO: "LatAm accounted for 19% of KO EBIT in FY15, and we estimate that Mexico accounts for 10-12% of earnings (11% of CSDs and NARTDs, as per Euromonitor)."PEP: "At PEP Mexico is 6% of CSDS (end unit cases), but 12% of NARTDs (water, others), according to Euromonitor, and it accounts for 8% of Frito. So roughly, we’d say Mexico is 8-9% of PEP’s global earnings." Nov. 9, 2016, 11:58 AM | 2 Comments

Soda taxes will be in the spotlight on November 8
Researchers from Harvard University estimate that soda consumption could fall as much 20% in select California cities if a soda tax is passed on November 8. The same study predicted a 4% drop in diabetes cases as a result of soda taxation.California voters in San Francisco, Albany and Oakland are voting on the tax, as well as voters in Boulder, Colorado. The issue is also going in front of the Cook County Commission (Chicagoland) soon for a decision over what's openly being called a political money grab.The beverage industry had a very strong record of turning back soda tax initiatives, but saw a setback when the Philadelphia City Council approved a $0.015-per-ounce soda tax last June.Related stocks: KO, PEP, DPS, MNST, FIZZ, COT.

Coca-Cola to acquire SABMiller Africa bottling stake
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) says it will exercise its right to acquire SABMiller’s (OTCPK:SBMRY, OTCPK:SBMRF) former interest in its largest African bottling company, saying it plans to implement its long-term strategic plan in these markets with other partners.The move comes after Anheuser-Busch InBev closed its acquisition of SABMiller to create a beer giant with a large African footprint; as of late August, SABMiller had a 54% stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which distributes ~40% of Coke's volumes in the continent.KO wants to keep AB InBev at arm's length amid speculation that the European company eventually could try to acquire it.

Megabeverage: Coca-Cola seen as ultimate target for Anheuser-Busch
It don't take long after shareholders at Anheuser-Busch (BUD -1.4%) and SABMiller (OTCPK:SBMRY) formally agreed to a mega-merger before talk of what's the next M&A move cropped up with plenty of heavy hitters holding shares.Both HSBC and Stifel Nicolaus think Coca-Coca (KO -0.1%) will be the next target for the beer behemoth, perhaps even sooner than some may think. The synergy math could be stunning if all the complications of an acquisition are worked out.On the bottling side, the integration of SABMiller into A-B has plenty of implications for the sector, even more so if speculation over a Coca-Cola deal escalates.Related bottling stocks: COKE, CCE, KOF, OTC:COCSF, OTC:COKEB, OTCPK:CCLAY, OTCPK:CCLAF.

Soda lobby sues to block Philly soda tax
The American Beverage Association is suing to block Philadelphia's soft drinks tax, marking the latest clash between the soda industry and public officials seeking to boost revenue and combat health risks.In June, Philly became the largest U.S. city to approve a volume-based tax of 1.5%-per-ounce on sugar sweetened beverages.Voters in San Francisco and at least three other places will vote in November on whether to impose similar levies.Related stocks: KO, PEP, DPS, MNST, FIZZ, SBUX, UL, PG Sep. 15, 2016, 5:01 AM | 76 Comments
Anheuser-Busch InBev master plan: Coke or Pepsi?
In a fresh note to investors, Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zunaic tackles the huge question of if PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) or Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will be the next major target for Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) down the road.Though it's highly speculative at this point, PepsiCo appears as the more logical choice if the pros and cons are lined up. Snippets from Zuanic's note are posted below.On accretion value: "An acquisition of PEP drinks would be over 20% EPS accretive (one quarter stock funded), while a bid for KO would not (all cash a KO bid would push gearing to 8x)."On global markets: "True, overseas KO is much larger than PEP, but that may be a moot point as the KO overseas business is mainly in the hands of independent bottlers (so is PEP’s except for Russia). But we think PEP bottlers in markets like Mexico, China, India, and Canada, could be more reasonable acquisition targets for BUD down the road (than KO bottlers) and would actually provide relevant scale up benefits."On distribution: "In terms of bringing scale to its beer distributors we note KO and PEP are similar in size in the US (in terms of end unit cases of NARTDs), but more importantly the PEP drinks business is 75% PEP owned while by end of 2017 KO’s US operating business (bottling and distribution) will all be in the hands of independent bottlers."On the Buffett factor: "Those expecting a bid for KO say so in part because of the Warren Buffet presence (holder of a 9.3% stake in KO), but would he really want that to be his legacy (i.e., the man that sold the Coke?)."Current market caps: BUD $194B, KO $178B, PEP $149B.Name check: Financing the deal is one matter, but negotiating a new corporate name for the mega-beverage entity could be just as engaging.

An alternative container tax has also been bandied around. although it wouldn't bring in the same amount of tax dollars.It's unclear which direction the city council will go with lobbying efforts on both sides picking up.Related: KO, PEP, DPS, MNST, COT.

Buffett takes show to CNBC
Following the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) annual meeting on Saturday, Warren Buffett is spending the morning with CNBC.On IBM: He's still a buyer of the stock, though not aggressively so. His cost basis is a little less than $170 per share vs. the current $146. He's comfortable with the company, he says, or else he wouldn't own the stock. Yes, IBM has tough competition, but it's always been so and always will be so.Again defending Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO): It's "illogical" to tax sugar in soft drinks and not all sugar. He says he drinks five cans of Coke a day ... "I can't imagine anyone feels better than I do."On American Express (NYSE:AXP): There's no question that "payments" are being attacked on all fronts by some very smart people. Losing Costco was a big deal, but CEO Ken Chenault decided the economics didn't make sense. The company is buying back about 6% of the float each year, raising Berkshire's stake in AmEx without it having to lay out a dime. It's a wonderful business, but it's not a business that's competition-free, nor will it ever be.Turning to Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO): Obviously, they deteriorated significantly, and something has to change. On Marissa Mayer's $55M golden parachute ... Severance numbers throughout corporate America are a little bit crazy. May 2, 2016, 8:12 AM | 89 Comments

Buffett and Munger hold court at Berkshire annual meeting
Capitalist Woodstock is being livestreamed for the first time ever. Watch here.Pressed (again) about how he squares his investment with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) with the health issues caused by too much sugar intake, Warren Buffett (BRK.A, BRK.B) says happiness is also important to health and longevity, and he chooses to get his calories "from things that make me feel good when I eat them." Munger is more direct: Questions like that are "immature and stupid."Unveiling preliminary Q1 numbers, Buffett takes note of a big drop in operating earnings for insurance - in part due to hailstorms in Texas - and railroads. While investment income about doubled Y/Y to $1.85B, Buffett says ignore it - it was due to the completion of the Duracell deal.Operating earnings of $3.737B in Q1 dipped from $4.24B a year ago. Net earnings of $5.59B rose from $5.16B thanks to that investment income.Asked why Berkshire has shifted to buying companies that are far more capital intensive than in the past, Buffett calls it a problem of prosperity. Small companies not needing capital can't move the needle for a company of Berkshire's size.Live blog at Marketwatch Apr. 30, 2016, 11:37 AM | 110 Comments

No pop for Monster Beverage after weak results
Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) fell 7% AH after reporting distributor issues led to weaker results than anticipated."Distributor transitions and uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola distribution network limited further revenue growth during the quarter," said CEO Rodney Sacks.The company was also stung by the high level of customer orders pulled forward into Q3 to jump ahead of a price hike.The missed sales led to Monster's operating expenses jumping 420 bps to 27.1% of sales.Shares of Monster may have dropped even further if not for the new $1.75B share repurchase plan that was unveiled.

Chobani spurns PepsiCo investment, elects to go solo
Privately held Chobani says it has rejected overtures from PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) to take a stake, preferring to go it alone in a contentious yogurt market.The sticking point was the size of the stake, Bloomberg reports: Pepsi wanted a majority share, while Chobani wanted to sell a minority stake. The move effectively ends talks of a tie-up.Chobani has reportedly smoothed over struggles from rapid growth that included a massive yogurt plant in Idaho, and the company now plans to self-fund expansion, including a move into Mexico.It looks like the end of a proxy war that could have valued Chobani at $3B. In the fall, rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) ended talks to invest in Chobani, deciding it wasn't a great fit.PepsiCo had ended its joint yogurt venture with Muller in December by closing a western New York plant that had opened in 2013.

Coca-Cola could become eventual target for AB InBev, analyst suggests
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was upgraded today to Neutral from Negative with a $40 price target, raised from $33, at Susquehanna, which speculates that KO could become a potential target for Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) - following the merger deal with SABMiller - in the future if BUD decides it wants to enter the soft drink market.The firm also feels KO's North American profitability could be improved by better pricing in the U.S. and refranchising efforts; it also thinks KO could help its global growth platform with further M&A of its own, suggesting WhiteWave Foods (NYSE:WWAV) as a possibility.KO's fundamentals remain challenging, Susquehanna says, as 75% of earnings come from outside North America; dietary concerns remain an issue, especially around diet drinks; and the company’s ability to build a larger presence outside carbonated soft drinks remains questionable.

An intriguing open door for Anheuser-Busch InBev at Coca-Cola
Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD -0.7%) will get a crack at kicking the tires of Coca-Cola (KO +1.7%), according to Nomura analyst Ian Shackleton,The line of reasoning goes that if AB InBev is in the door as a distribution partner (small due to Pepsi contracts) of Coca-Cola, then it can evaluate long-term merger potential. The strategy would be similar to how InBev gained access to Anheuser-Busch through a distribution partnership before the two beer giants combined.A Coca-Cola/SABMiller/AB-InBev confluence would break some M&A needles if it was ever pulled off with the three beverage giants claiming a combined market cap of $482B.For the record, Nomura has been pushing out Coca-Cola buyout propositions for quite a while. Last year, it speculated on a Buffett/3G Capital acquisition. 3G of course is rather friendly with AB-InBev.Shares of Coca-Cola are active today, due in part to the rocket ride for Keurig Green Mountain following its earnings report.

Coca-Cola facing $3.3B tax bill over foreign transfers
Coca-Cola (KO -1%) said today that the IRS says it may owe $3.3B in back federal taxes due to foreign transfer pricing -- a tax issue that usually hits technology and pharmaceutical companies instead.The IRS also recommended the issue be designated for litigation, finding that Coca-Cola's income from 2007-2009 should have been reported to be higher. Last year, it reported an effective tax rate of 23.6%, below the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, due to a higher percentage of operating income coming overseas.The increasingly frequent issue hits multinationals over where they log profits. The IRS accuses companies of moving profits to countries with lower tax rates. In Coca-Cola's case, it's about how it profits from sales of soda concentrate from its worldwide concentrate plants.In an 8-K, Coca-Cola said it "firmly believes that the assessments are without merit and plans to pursue all administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter."

Goldman rate-hike plays: Favor balance sheet quality, avoid floating rate debt
With market eyes on a Fed rate-hike decision considered to be a bit of a toss-up amid differing opinions, Goldman Sachs is banking on the (slightly) more dovish position that the agency will wait until December. The bank is still laying out how to play the hike when it invariably comes.Strength in balance sheets is what you need, it says, noting that those companies outperform (by an average 5%) in the three months after a rate-boosting cycle begins. In Goldman's "High Quality Stock" basket: CMG, DLTR, PEP, KMI, BLK, GOOG, AAPL, PCLN, ORCL, WFC.Meanwhile, it suggests avoiding companies with high floating-rate debt as they bear the brunt of a move away from near-zero interest rate policy. "When the tightening cycle finally starts, the immediate impact will be felt by firms with high proportions of variable rate borrowing."Included in that "avoid" list: CL, COL, JNJ, AAPL, EBAY, MET, KO, GIS, F, MCD, GM, TWX, CVX, AGN, MON.(Yes, cash-rich Apple made both lists, having a strong balance sheet along with floating debt.)

A crafty way to profits for the beverage industry
Craft soda is starting to become a trend to watch closely, according to industry insiders.Though still accounting for only ~1% of the total U.S. soda market, major retail chains have increasingly been willing to bet on local craft brands in store aisles.The craft craze is old news for the beer industry where coming-of-age millennials buy craft/local beers at a 50% higher rate than brand-loyal older generations. Fading stars such as Budweiser and Bud Light are testament to the impact of the millennial paradigm.The craft influence in coffee hasn't been lost on Starbucks which has strategically deployed trucks on college campuses in an effort to win over students.Despite the progressive reputation of Starbucks, analysts think new upstarts such as Craft (subscription) and Cups (app) have a shot of gaining influence with the Indie-minded millennial crowd on "customization" and pricing.What to watch: An increase in M&A activity in the beverage sector is expected as major companies strategically pick off more local craft brands to incubate.Craft beer watch: BUD, OTCPK:SBMRY, TAP, OTCQX:HEINY, SAM, BREW, STZ, OTC:BIBLF, OTCPK:BRBMF.Craft coffee watch: GMCR, SBUX, JVA, SJM, KRFT, DNKN, QSR, MCD.Craft soda watch: PEP, KO, MNST, COT, DPS, OTCQB:JSDA, REED, SODA,  FIZZ.

Coke chooses caution, sees too much risk in swallowing all of Monster
So why didn't Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) just go all the way and acquire all of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) instead of stopping at an asset swap and a 16.7% stake?More than anything, "it's about protecting the [Coke] brand and the image" from a company that urges consumers to "unleash the beast" with drinks such as Assault and Khaos, said a person close to Coke.Coke figures it deals with enough controversy from those who blame sugary sodas for obesity and diabetes; it wants to keep at arm's length from the more serious public relations battles facing the energy drinks industry, including an FDA probe over deaths possibly linked to Monster.On the financial side, the deal involves a reasonable $2.1B cash up front, while a full acquisition would have required at least $12B based on Thursday's closing stock price - roughly equivalent to the amount of cash Coke had on hand at the end of July.Despite the cautious approach, Coke could still own Monster some day; a standstill agreement limits KO to increasing its stake to 25% over four years, but MNST's board can waive it at any time.

Coca-Cola revenues miss estimates as North America growth stalls
Coca-Cola (KO -2.6%) opens sharply lower after Q2 revenues fell Y/Y and finished below expectations as North America sales declined for the second straight quarter.Q2 global unit case volume grew 3% Y/Y but was flat in North America, despite increased marketing around the World Cup and the launch of the "Share a Coke" campaign; J.P. Morgan analysts had expected volumes to gain 1%-2% in North America, which accounted for 45% of total Q2 revenue.On the bright side, gross margin widened to 61.7% as input costs declined 3.4% from a year earlier.KO also says adjusted earnings would be hurt by $0.02 in H2 due to the restructuring of its juice operations in Russia and the separation of its Brazilian bottling operations last year.

FDA gives thumbs up to new sugar substitute
The U.S. regulator approves advantame, the sixth sugar substitute to get the agency's blessing. It can used as a tabletop sweetener or as an ingredient in cooking by virtue of its stability at high temperatures.The approval was based on the results of 37 animal and human studies submitted by the manufacturer.Advantame is chemically similar to aspartame (Equal). People with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria have difficulty metabolizing phenylalanine, a component of both aspartame and advantame. Food containing aspartame must be labeled as such. The amount of advantame needed to achieve a similar level of sweetness as aspartame is much less so no special labeling will be required.The last sweetener cleared by the FDA was neotame (Newtame) in 2002.Just a few related tickers: (PG) (PEP) (KO) (GIS) (K) May 20, 2014, 7:15 PM | 9 Comments

Analyst: Coca-Cola "fully engaged" in GMCR, sees value in single serve
Today’s news that Coca-Cola (KO +0.6%) has increased its equity position in Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR +7.5%) to 16% from the original 10% purchase leads Canaccord analysts to believe that KO favorably views GMCR's positioning and growth opportunity in coffee, and has confidence in the upcoming Keurig Cold launch.Regardless of the timing of adding to its stake, Canaccord says the move illustrates the value in single-serve and with Coke as a 16% holder, "the strongest potential partner in cold beverages is fully engaged" with a significant material interest in the upcoming Keurig Cold launch, and the stake also could boost GMCR's valuation reflecting the addition of a premium over the speculation of a future take-out by KO.

Buffett/Munger take questions at "Capitalist Woodstock"
He didn't want to "go to war" with management, says Warren Buffett, responding to the first question asked of him at the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) annual meeting: Why did he abstain from voting on the controversial equity compensation plan for Coca-Cola (KO) executives?"You keep belching at the dinner table, you'll be eating in the kitchen," says Buffett, describing the clubby culture of corporate boards where being agreeable keeps you on the inside and being confrontational gets you blackballed. "I've voted for compensation plans in various places that are far from what I would have designed myself ... That is the way boards work."A shareholder proposal requesting Berkshire board consideration of a dividend received less than 2% of the vote, pleasing to Buffett who believes he and Charlie Munger can do a better job of allocating company capital than returning it to shareholders. Still, with $40B and rising in Berkshire's coffers, even Buffett concedes the day is coming when the company has "more cash than we can intelligently invest.""That error that they made doesn't bother me," says Buffett of Bank of America (BAC), which had to suspend its capital return plan after miscalculating capital levels. "It doesn't change my feeling about Bank of America's risk management one iota."Mungerisms: Comparing Berkshire book value to the S&P 500 is "insane" and makes it harder for Buffett to look good. "Warren sets a ridiculously high standard. The last couple of years added $60B in value ... If that's failure, then I want more of it." May 3, 2014, 7:51 PM | 66 Comments

Barron's gets bullish on Coke
"Much of Coke's (KO) recent volume weakness can be traced to temporary factors that should abate next year," writes Jack Hough, who thinks shares of the world's largest beverage company could gain 20% next year.The "key" for KO, says Hough, citing Janney analyst Jonathan Feeney, is the 700M people that will join the middle class over the next seven years. This could cause "soft-drink sales to double" over the next decade or so.Hough goes on to cite a number of sell-siders including RBC's Nik Modi who notes KO's "share price implies just 2.3% compounded-yearly growth in earnings before interest and taxes through 2020, about four percentage points below the company's long-term pace," and Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog who says a spin-off of the company's bottling operations "would raise profit margins and unlock a higher valuation for the stock."Apples to apples (perhaps): Barron's says KO trades at a 4% premium to Pepsi (PEP) — that premium has at times reached 20%.

Sugar the new tobacco? Bottled water to soon surpass soft drinks
"I've never seen anything like it," says Beverage Marketing Corporation chief Michael Bellas, as bottled water continues to grab market share from soft drinks. Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) have obviously noticed and cary their own bottled water lines, but these are low margin. Both have failed to gain much traction in the more profitable business of so-called enhanced waters.Nearly 90% of doctors globally tie the epidemics of type II diabetes and obesity to excess sugar consumption, according to a loud new Credit Suisse report, titled, "Is Sugar Turning The Economy Sour?"Sugar - and its cousin high fructose corn syrup - can be found in pretty much every single item of processed food available nowadays, but the biggest villain is soft drinks, with CS estimating 43% of added sugars in our diets coming from sweetened beverages. "Recent research shows that as the sugar is in a solution, it is easily and completely ingested, giving a large injection of calories without the consequential feeling of being full." The good news (or bad news if you own a purveyor of sugar) is the public is catching on - though this varies significantly by demographic.Public policy is catching on too, with Credit Suisse - in a nod to tobacco - noting sugar "meet(ing) the criteria for being a potentially addictive substance." Mexico (not Bloomberg's NYC) may provide the first test case as the President has proposed a tax on sales of sugary drinks.More on the CS report and sugar from Izabella Kaminska.

Cooler heads are saying that a SodaStream (SODA +6.3%) partnership with a major beverage company (KO, PEP, DPS) is more likely than a takeover.

More on Coca-Cola (KO) in China (previous): The billions the company plans to funnel into China is based on the belief that the market in China is vastly under-penetrated. The Chinese only consume an average of 39 Coca-Cola products (Coke Zero, Sprint, Diet Coke, Minute Maid, etc.) a year compared to the amazing 400 Coke products per consumer in the U.S. (Mayor Bloomberg are you keeping up?). Working in the company's favor is a long-standing relationship with China's government that has been smoother (so far) than the path of some other U.S. consumer giants.

The soda industry continues to push back at the contention of NYC Mayor Bloomberg amongst others that the nation's obesity issues and high level of soda intake are interwoven. According to data dug out by academics, despite getting close to 100% of the blame, extra sugar only accounts for 9% of the extra calories the U.S. population takes in today compared to 30 years ago. Of that 9% extra sugar rush, soda only makes up a subset of the total. Oct. 12, 2012, 1:01 PM | 27 Comments

Coca-Cola (KO -0.4%) and PepsiCo (PEP -0.1%) start to use the same tactics that Big Tobacco has employed for years of championing the right of consumers to pick their own products. While the campaign of Mayor Bloomberg in New York City to ban large-sized soda drinks appears to be only a minor irritant, increasing talk of restricting soda products from the food stamp program stands as a more legitimate threat to soda sales if it takes hold.

Coca-Cola (KO) CEO Muhtar Kent says the company will start tapping into its $13B stockpile of cash, with a focus on capital expenditures at the top of the list.

At issue are the touring exhibits across the world of Coke-related trash that Sodastream uses to demonstrate the environmental benefits of home brewing soda. By filing off the letter, Coca-Cola may have drawn more publicity to the events than they were ever going to generate on their own. Jun. 18, 2012, 12:39 PM | 4 Comments

Execs with Coca-Cola (KO -0.1%) unload on NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg over his plan to curb soda intake as the elixir for the nation's obesity issues. Headliner Katie Bayne says obesity rose during the last 20 years as beverage intake declined, as she ponders why only a few names are getting singled out?

Michelle Obama backs the proposed ban in NYC on large-sized soda drinks before issuing a statement later on detailing that she didn't quite mean to enter the debate.

Could it stick? Though a majority of New Yorkers seem to vociferously oppose Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed ban on large-sized sugary drinks, Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj can't help but wonder if other cities will follow the Big Apple's lead on taking on obesity and leave beverage companies jumping around from one locale to another defending consumers' right of choice. Possibly in line to play Whack-A-Mole: KO, PEP, DPS, COTT, MNST.

Michael Bloomberg abruptly cancels a live appearance with AllThingsD as a controversy over his plan to ban large-sized sugary drinks in NYC creates outrage in public forums and from the beverage industry. While the city served as a successful model for public smoking restrictions, it's a bit harder to craft an argument over the dangers of second-hand soda drinking. A statement from Coca-Cola (KO -0.2%) cuts to the chase: "New Yorkers expect and deserve better than this."

Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposes a sweeping ban in New York City on large-sized sugary drinks at restaurants, movie theaters, and from street vendors in one of the most ambitious local measures to take on obesity. If passed, the new law would prohibit the sale of sodas, pre-sweetened ice teas, and sugar-laced energy drinks larger than 16 ounces. In somewhat twisted logic, New Yorkers could still buy two 16-ounce drinks - instead of one 32-ouncer. On the mayor's radar: DPS, KO, PEP, MNST, COT.

Minyanville sees the case of Heineken's (HINKY.PK) foray into China as a cautionary tale for firms thinking about betting big in the nation.

Could the same consumer peaking process happen to MCD, KO, Pizza Hut/KFC, and other U.S. firms as they pour investments into expansion in China?
