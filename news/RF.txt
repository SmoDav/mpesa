Banks head lower following rate hike
The major averages, bonds, and gold have all turned higher after the Fed lifted the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, but satiated bank bulls might be lightening up just a hair.After all, the "dots" showed the Fed as being no more hawkish than a couple of meetings back when it surprised the world by predicting three rate hikes this year. Inflation and growth expectations were essentially unchanged as well.So while the Fed may have been faster with a rate hike than many expected just a couple of weeks back, it appears the timetable past today remains the same.KBE -0.15%, KRE -0.1%, XLF flatJanet Yellen's press conference is just getting underway.Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), Citigroup (C -0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.1%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.3%), PNC Financial (PNC -0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY +0.2%), Regions Financial (RF), SunTrust (STI -1%), Fifth Third (FITB -0.7%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

FBR picks bank winners and losers from rate hike
The lenders best poised to capture the benefit of higher rates have a high percentage of floating-rate loans (typically C&I), a small securities book, and strong deposit base with a large mix of non-interest-bearing checking accounts, says analyst Bob Ramsey.Fitting the bill are Iberiabank (IBKC +1%), Preferred Bank (PFBC +1.2%), Regions Financial (RF +0.2%), Zions Bancorp (ZION +0.7%), ConnectOne (CNOB +0.8%), PacWest Bancorp (PACW +0.9%), State Bank Financial (STBZ +0.3%), Atlantic Capital (ACBI +0.3%), Comerica (CMA +0.1%).Poorly positioned in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB +0.9%) thanks to its large book of fixed-rate assets, relatively small level of checking deposits, and sizable mortgage banking operations.Source: Bloomberg

Investors take some profits in financials
Satiated bulls are doing some selling today, with the regional banking sector (KRE -2.4%) being hit the hardest (it's still higher by 56% Y/Y).With opinion about a March rate hike having swung in the past handful of days from "no chance" to "sure thing," it's probably not a bad idea to take some profits. There's still the February employment report to come (next Friday, not tomorrow), and a weak one could quickly dial back hopes for higher rates.Regions Financial (RF -3.6%), New York Community (NYCB -2.6%), KeyCorp (KEY -2.4%), PNC Financial (PNC -2.5%), Fifth Third (FITB -3.3%), SunTrust (STI -2.6%), M&T (MTB -3.1%)

Market has not fully rewarded some Trump-trade winners, Jefferies says
Some Trump-trade stocks in commodity cyclical sectors have further upside, a group of Jefferies analysts writes."These groups are levered to GDP and are likely beneficiaries of higher inflation," Jefferies says, as it identifies stocks within the sectors with company specific attributes that may result in even better performance.Jefferies' list of stocks that should see benefits from “most permutations of tax reform and from better growth and reflation” includes: BA, GCP, HAL, IP, NUE, OSK, PKG, PX, RES, TXT, URI, WRK, X.The 10 S&P 500 stocks up most since the election - all up more than 44%: URI, ARNC, CSX, BAC, AMP, NRG, CFG, RF, LUK, INCY.

Banks give some back as rates sink to 2017 low
The 10-year Treasury yield is off another four basis points today to 2.33% - now at the bottom of a range of about 2.3%-2.6% that it's occupied since shortly after the election.Financial sector investors betting on higher interest rates may be keeping a close eye on whether or not a downside breakout occurs.For now, satiated bulls are cashing in a few chips, with the XLF -0.9%, the KRE -1.15%, and KBE -1.05% vs. the S&P 500's 0.15% decline.Bank of America (BAC -1.9%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.2%), Morgan Stanley (MS -2.4%), Regions Financial (RF -1.3%), KeyCorp (KEY -1.5%), Fifth Third (FITB -1.1%), State Street (STT -1.2%), Schwab (SCHW -0.9%), MetLife (MET -1.6%), Lincoln National (LNC -1.4%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

Dollar, banks on the move as Yellen leans hawkish
Testifying before the Senate this morning, Fed Chair Janet Yellen says it would be "unwise" to delay on rate hikes, thus suggesting a move in March could be more likely than previously thought.The 10-year Treasury yield is higher by 6.7 basis points to 2.50%, and Fed Funds futures are pricing in slightly more hawkish Fed policy for the remainder of the year.Also notable was lack of much mention of regulation in Yellen's opening remarks. There had been thought that Yellen would use the opportunity to push back against Trump administration and congressional calls for a sizable rollback of Dodd-Frank and the stress test regime.Welcoming news of higher rates (and no news yet on regulations) is the financial sector: (XLF +0.7%), (KBE +1.2%), (KRE +1.3%)Bank of America (BAC +2%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.2%), Citigroup (C +1.5%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.2%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2%), Regionsl Financial (RF +1.8%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.2%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.5%), PNC Financial (PNC +0.8%), Fifth Third (FITB +1.6%), Lincoln National (LNC +1.7%) MetLife (MET +0.8%), AIG (AIG +0.8%)The dollar (UUP +0.4%) has also moved higher since Yellen took the stage.

Lenders lead advance as House's Hensarling lays out his plans
Writing in the WSJ last night, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau a rogue agency, purposely created to be insulated from Congressional, presidential, or voter oversight."The regulatory web spun by the CFPB can make every provider of financial services guilty until proven innocent, inviting selective enforcement and financial shakedowns."He notes Dodd-Frank specifically excluded auto lenders from CFPB jurisdiction, but that hasn't stopped Richard Cordray (CFPB chief) and company, as the likes of Santander Consumer (SC +1.2%), Ally Financial (ALLY +1%), and Credit Acceptance Corp. (CACC +1.9%) have found out. The House two years ago voted overwhelmingly voted to stop the CFPB's efforts in this area, but Elizabeth Warren was able to halt the bill in the Senate.The president, says Hensarling, should fire Richard Cordray yesterday, put in place a new director to undo all harmful actions taken by the agency, and then get to work putting policies to work that actually protect consumers.Even with better leadership, though, the CFPB would still be unconstitutional, he continues, so the agency must be "functionally terminated" through a simple majority vote to cut off funding (which comes from the Fed, not Congress).In other Hensarling news, Bloomberg has seen a memo outlining other Dodd-Frank reforms, including reducing stress tests to just every other year.XLF +1.3%, KRE +1.5%, KBE +1.3%OneMain (OMF +4.4%), BofA (BAC +1.6%), Citigroup (C +1.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2.2%), Regions (RF +2.7%), KeyCorp (KEY +1%), SunTrust (STI +1.6%), BB&T (BBT +1.1%), M&T (MTB +1.2%), Zions (ZION +2%)

Fiduciary rule still in focus
A Dallas federal judge has upheld the Labor Department's fiduciary rule, dealing a setback to the financial industry's attempts to kill the measure.But the legal move may not mean much for the regulation's fate.Last Friday, President Trump issued a memorandum to study the rule's impact and rescind or revise it if it isn't consistent with his administration's regulatory principles. A status report will be published on March 10.Related tickers: JPM, C, BAC, WFC, GS, MS, USB, BK, STT, PNC, COF, KRE, KBE, RF, KEY, IVZ, TROW, LM, AB, FII, WDR, LPLA

Banks and asset managers higher as Trump takes aim at Dodd-Frank, DOL rule
The president later today is expected to sign executive orders to scale back Dodd-Frank and to postpone implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary role."We’re not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year,” White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn tells the WSJ. “The banks are going to be able to price product more efficiently and more effectively to consumers ... This is a table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming."The moves are sure to upset consumer groups and the opposition party, not to mention the ambitious CFPB and its director Richard Cordray (of whom, Cohn implies his days heading that agency are numbered).KRE +1.45%, KBE +1.6%Bank of America (BAC +2.1%), Citigroup (C +2%), Goldman (GS +3%), Morgan Stanley (MS +3.3%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.9%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.5%), PNC (PNC +1.5%), Invesco (IVZ +3.6%), T.

Banks lead decline on Wall Street
The KBE and KRE are each down more than 2% vs. the S&P 500's 1% retreat.Pick your excuse, but the best explanation is probably seen in the sharp upward and to the right price charts of the banking sector names, and the occasional need to take a breath.There's also politics, and Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin over the weekend provided more evidence that the Trump administration intends to tweak, but not gut Dodd-Frank. At issue is the Volcker Rule which prohibits lenders from taking risky bets with federally-insured deposits.Mnuchin in a letter to lawmakers: "A legal distinction between the insured and non-insured entity is an important factor ...

Morgan Stanley, Comerica lead banks lower despite strong earnings
Bank earnings have been running hot, but having bid the sector sharply higher for nearly all of 2016, and particularly since the election, investors are selling the news.The latest two examples are Morgan Stanley (MS -2.2%) and Comerica (CMA -4.2%), both of which blew past estimates this morning. Comerica, for instance, is up a tidy 85% Y/Y, including a 38% run over the last three months.The KRE is down 2.6% and the KBE down 2.5%.Bank of America (BAC -2.7%), JPMorgan (JPM -2.5%), Citigroup (C -1.8%), Goldman Sachs (GS -1.8%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -2.1%), Regions (RF -3.8%), KeyCorp (KEY -2.8%), PNC Financial (PNC -2.8%), SunTrust (STI -2.6%), Zions (ZION -3.2%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

Investors give 'thumbs up' to bank earnings; KBE +2.3%
There was a bit of caution among bank investors in the past couple of days, but they're back to buying low and selling high this morning as the initial results from Q4 begin to pour in. Among those reporting today: Bank of America (BAC +1.8%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.9%), Wells Fargo (WFC +2.8%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.4%), First Horizon (FHN -0.3%).KBE +2.3%, KRE +2.5%; the S&P 500 is ahead 0.3%.An early take from KBW's Bose George: Mortgage banking trends are weakening in line with expectations - with stronger volumes being offset by lower gain-on-sale margins. Higher rates are still filtering through though, and industry sources and recent data suggest volumes falling 10-15% this quarter.Piper's Kevin Barker calls Wells Fargo's operating numbers "decent," but notes rising auto loan net charge-offs - 1.05% in Q4  vs. 0.87% in Q3, and 0.59% a year earlier.Bloomberg's Alison Williams takes note of the positive signal of boosted buybacks at Bank of America, and calls cost cuts "key." It's hard to get too excited about any particular metric given the bank's near-50% run higher in the past few months.Other players: Goldman (GS +1.1%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2%), Citigroup (C +1.6%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.3%), Regions Financial (RF +3.2%), New York Community (NYCB +1.3%), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN +2.2%), KeyCorp (KEY +2.3%)

Banks lead S&P 500 lower as bulls lighten up ahead of earnings
Q4 earnings season kicks off tomorrow morning with Bank of America (BAC -1.1%), Wells Fargo (WFC -0.8%), JPMorgan (JPM -0.8%), PNC Financial(PNC -3%), First Horizon (FHN -2.1%), and First Republic (FRC -1.4%) all reporting. BlackRock (BLK -1.4%) is also due up tomorrow.Among those next coming next week: Citigroup (C -1.2%), Goldman Sachs (GS -1%), and Morgan Stanley (MS -1.2%).The KBE is up a whopping 40% Y/Y, including a 23.5% run since the election. It's lower by 1.9% on today's session vs. the S&P 500's 0.5% decline.Giving well-fed financial sector bulls another reason to take some profits is the continued decline in interest rates over the past few weeks, with the 10-year yield lower by another six basis points today to 2.32% - it topped at about 2.60% in mid-December.KeyCorp (KEY -2%), Regions Financial (RF -1.5%), Fifth Third (FITB -1.5%), State Street (STT -1.7%), MetLife (MET -1.9%), Prudential (PRU -2.9%), E*Trade (ETFC -1.5%), Schwab (SCHW -1.2%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

Financials sink alongside rates and retail
The S&P 500 is lower by just 0.3%, but the financial sector (XLF -1.9%) is taking a sizable breather from its big post-election run.Those buying on hopes for the long-awaited sustained rise in interest rates might be pausing as the 10-year yield sinks seven basis points to 2.37%. Two weeks ago, it was at 2.60%.Bond bears have at least a couple of excuses to lighten up today. One might be softer-than-hoped jobs numbers from ADP. Or maybe economy bulls are mulling the carnage in retail (XRT -3.2%) - unless you happen to be Amazon (+2.3%) - following guidance, job, and store cuts at Macy's, and another 150 closings at Sears, as well as weak numbers from players like Kohl's.Bank of America (BAC -2.6%), Citigroup (C -2.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC -2.8%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.9%), Morgan Stanley (MS -3.1%), Regions Financial (RF -2.6%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -1.9%), KeyCorp (KEY -1.7%), Fifth Third (FITB -2.9%), Schwab (SCHW -1.5%), MetLife (MET -2.4%), AIG (AIG -1.4%)

Slump in mortgage demand deepens
Yes, it was the holiday season, but don't discount the big move lower in the MBA mortgage application index over the past two weeks, says Piper's Kevin Barker. The latest data supports Barker's and team's view that refinance volume could drop 40-50% in Q1 from Q3 of 2016.In addition to lower volume, limited demand for mortgages is likely to cause gain-on-sale margins to decline in the near-term, says Barker.Among the names with exposure: AJX, BBT, BKFS, CFG, CLGX, FAF, FBC, FNF, HBAN, KEY, MTB, NRZ, NSM, OCN, PFSI, PNC, RF, RLGY, STI, USB, WFC, ZIONSource for Barker comments: Bloomberg

Banks continue surge on higher rates, lower regulation
There are multi-year highs again across the sector as interest rates continue to rise, but, maybe more importantly, bank investors begin to envision a far less heavy regulatory burden.In a speech Friday described by FBR's Ed Mills as "going out swinging," Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo set himself up as the chief defender of the status quo, saying he doesn't see a "sound economic case" for rolling back the post-crisis regulatory regime.Whether anyone hears him much going forward is a different story, given names like former BB&T boss John Allison or former FDIC chief Thomas Hoenig being thrown around as possible Fed vice chairmen for bank supervision. Both Allison and Hoenig are fans of following simple leverage ratios, but Tarullo says just focusing on those is "inadequate and dangerous."Tarullo's voice will also have to rise above that of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum led by Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman.XLF +1.15%, KRE +1.1%, KBE +1.25%Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.4%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.6%), Citigroup (C +2.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.5%), Synovus (SNV +1.1%), SunTrust (STI +1.4%), Primerica (PRI +2.1%), Bank of New York (BNY +1.4%), State Street (STT +1.1%)

Banks back in the lead as new Treasury chief has Dodd-Frank in sights
While the pick of ex-Goldmanite and Hollywood player Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary can hardly be called "draining the swamp," Pantheon's Ian Shepherdson says it should make Wall Street happy.In his first public comments after being selected, Mnuchin promised to "kill" swaths of Dodd-Frank.Also making Wall Street (and other bankers/insurers/brokers) happy today is another big move higher in interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury yield up 10 basis points to 2.394%.The S&P 500 is just marginally higher, but the KBE is ahead 1.9%, and the KRE 2%.

The major averages are down just marginally, but the banks (KBE -1.3%), (KRE -1.1%) are sporting sizable early losses as the sell-side cashes in some chips after a big run higher for the sector.Valuations are full, higher interest rates have been baked in, and an uncertain election outcome are the common themes to the downgrades, which include earlier-reported cuts by Citigroup for Goldman, KeyCorp and Citizens Financial, and a downgrade to Regions Financial (RF -1.7%) by Sandler O'Neill.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, KRE, UYG, VFH, KBE, IYF, BTO, IAT, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, KBWB, QABA, KBWR, RYF, FINU, KRU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, KRS, JHMF, WDRW, DPST, FAZZ, FNCF, FTXO

Regions Financial in the red after earnings beat
The headline was a three cent beat, but Evercore ISI's John Pancari takes note of net interest margin - which compressed more than hoped - a 2.6% Q/Q rise in expenses (when he was expecting a 3% decline), and the operating efficiency ratio coming in at a perky 65.4% vs. 62.9% expected.Regions (NYSE:RF) is about the only bank in the red today, but barely so with a decline of 0.3%.Previously: Regions Financial beats by $0.03, beats on revenue (Oct. 18)

Banks lead early gains after beats from JPM, C, and WFC
JPMorgan and Citigroup both easily topped estimates thanks to a big rebound in previously-in-the-doldrums markets revenue. JPM is higher by 1%, and Citi by 2%. The read-through is pushing Goldman Sachs (GS +3%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2.7%) and Bank of America (BAC +2.4%) all nicely higher.Less capital-markets focused, Wells Fargo also beat forecasts, but not as soundly.

ECB "taper" chatter sends rates and financials higher
A Bloomberg report says the ECB is likely to gradually wind down bond purchases ahead of the scheduled March 2017 end of its QE program. The central bank is currently buying €80B per month of government and corporate paper, and may begin to slow that amount by €10B per month, according to the story.Yields are higher in Europe and the U.S., with the 10-year U.S. Treasury up five basis points to 1.675% and the German 10-year Bund yield is up four bps to -0.048%.

Latest stress test changes bad news for TBTFs, good news for smaller players
"Large banks are going to be forced to take on more capital," says Dick Bove. "It will make the cost of funding more, not less, expensive. It will reduce the appeal for investors to put money at risk in the banking system."Bove is commenting on a weekend announcement from Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo promising future stress tests will be geared to demanding even higher cash buffers for banks. Set to take effect next year, the new rule could raise capital requirements for the largest banks by 3 or 4 percentage points, writes Jeff Cox at CNBC.Interested parties: BAC, C, WFC, JPM, GS, MSThere's good news though, as those lenders with less than $250B in assets won't be subject to the same standards. FBR's Edward Mills calls it a "significant positive" for regionals, which now have more certainly on the process, reduced regulatory expenses, and thus the ability to return more capital to owners.Interested parties: RF, ZION, CMA, KEY, FITB, STI, NYCB, HBAN, PNC, BBT, MTBETFs: KRE, KBE, IAT, KBWB, QABA, KBWR, KRU, PSCF, KRS, WDRW, DPST

Six financials to buy on rate hike - Goldman
It's no surprise that yield-starved financials are expected to be a big beneficiary of higher base rates, but the team at Goldman has six that stand to gain the most.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), and Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) make the cut.Goldman sees an average 46% upside to normalized earnings for the group if rates go back to 3% (a long way off for even the most hawkish).Used to low and slow as far as rate hikes go, investors may be overlooking the potential for even one Fed move this year to be a positive catalyst. The team suggests taking a look at 6-month and 12-month calls on their recommendation list. Sep. 14, 2016, 11:03 AM | 14 Comments

Banks and insurers cheap for a reason
While nearly all major U.S. banks cruised through the stress tests last month, writes David Schawel, those exams are about determining if lenders have enough capital to get through a crisis, not whether they can earn the sort of risk-adjusted returns of the past.On this front (for insurers as well as banks), there's plenty more for investors to worry about, he says, thanks to the vanishing spread between short rates (what the companies pay on their liabilities), and long rates (what they earn on their assets).A new Fed study finds the adverse effect of weaker net interest margins is materially larger when rates are low. The reason: The lower bound of funding costs is zero as institutions are reticent to charge negative rates.Investors interested in buying banks or insurers because of seemingly cheap valuations might want to look again. Bank multiples, says Schawel, typically move alongside ROE, and serious improvement in ROE is unlikely with rates remaining low.Interested parties include: BAC, C, JPM, WFC, MET, PRU, LNC, PNC, USB, RF, KEY, KRE, KBE Jul. 11, 2016, 3:40 PM | 135 Comments

Yields on French government paper are now negative all the way out to nine years, and Swiss 50-year bonds now sport yields below zero.Some hawkish words today from San Francisco Fed President Williams weren't enough to lift the share prices of yield-starved financials (XLF -1.5%).The SPDR KBW Bank ETF (KBE -3%), the SPDR KBW Regional Bank ETF (KRE -3%)Citigroup (C -3.3%), Morgan Stanley (MS -3.5%), Regions Financial (RF -3.9%), Fifth Third (FITB -4.2%), Capital One (COF -3.3%), Legg Mason (LM -3.3%), E*Trade (ETFC -3.2%), Schwab (SCHW -3%), MetLife (MET -4.2%), Prudential (PRU -3.2%), Lincoln (LNC -4.5%) Jul. 5, 2016, 4:17 PM | 6 Comments

Financials lower by more than 4% post-Brexit
The Too Big To Fail lenders are naturally among the day's big losers following the U.K. vote to leave the EU, but losses in the financial sector are wide and deep as - among other things - interest rates look to be a lot lower for a lot longer.Among asset managers, Invesco (IVZ -10.8%) - with a sizable U.K. exposure - is faring about the worst. WisdomTree (WETF -7.8%) takes a hit as the yen is the solo currency surging against the dollar, reducing demand for its popular hedged Japan ETF.It's wait till next year (or even 2018 if you believe short-term rate futures markets) for rate hikes, meaning regional lenders can't celebrate their passing of the Fed stress tests last night. Regions (RF -7.8%), KeyCorp (KEY -6.4%), PNC Financial (PNC -5.5%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -4.2%), BB&T (BBT -5.1%).Even lower rates put even more pressure on the business models of the life insurers: MetLife (MET -8.8%), Prudential (PRU -7.7%), Lincoln National (LNC -9.9%), Voya (VOYA -7%).

BofA top bank idea at Baird
Not very excited about the prospects for bank stocks given the significant flattening in the yield curve as potentially signaling a deteriorating H2 and 2017 environment, a bank stock analyst nevertheless needs to recommend bank stocks.Given low expectations as reflected in its cheap valuation, its highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, and the chance for good news from CCAR, Bank of America (BAC -1.3%) is the team's top bank idea.Looking at regionals, they like the M&A optionality in Comerica (CMA -1.1%), but don't see much value in names like Citizens Financial Group (CFG -1.1%), Regions Financial (RF -1.1%), SunTrust (STI -0.9%), and Zions Bancorp (ZION -0.9%).

“Let’s not sugarcoat it, this is not necessarily a loan a bank wants to make at this point,” says Evercore ISI's Glenn Schorr, talking about loans banks have committed to for energy companies, but upon which those firms have not yet drawn.In Q1, energy borrowers announced draws of more than $3B on these loans, saddling banks with maybe more exposure to the sector than they or their investors would like right now.Citigroup (NYSE:C), for example, has about $20B in funded energy loan exposure, but commitments for nearly another $40B. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has loans of just over $20B and commitments for another $20B-plus. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) are showing similar stories (though mostly smaller amounts). Add it up, and there's $147B of unfunded loans disclosed by the ten of the largest U.S. banks.

Higher rates? Wait 'till next year
The 10-year Treasury yield at 1.69% has returned back to levels not seen since the panicky action in mid-February. And while the Fed has marked down its expectation of rate hikes this year to just two, short-term interest rate markets haven't even priced in one.This leaves those whose business model depends on riding the yield curve having to contend with not only a middling macro picture, but - once again - a rates lower for longer picture (although Jamie Dimon says his big fear is that markets aren't pricing in nearly enough in the way of higher rates).Citigroup (C -4.1%), Bank of America (BAC -3.3%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -2.8%), KeyCorp (KEY -3.4%), Regions Financial (RF -3.4%), BNY Mellon (BK -3.6%), E*Trade (ETFC -4.7%), Manulife (MFC -5.2%), Lincoln National (LNC -3.6%) Apr. 7, 2016, 3:09 PM | 13 Comments
Big banks: The CCAR submissions are in
"We are confident in the capital strength of the large and mid-cap banks - and with that, their capacity for increased capital returns," says Credit Suisse's Susan Roth Katzke.Stronger balance sheets, she says, should outweigh what is a harsher adverse scenario from the Fed.Roth and team see a total net capital return increase of 77% vs. 58% in 2015, with a median payout ratio of 31% vs. 27%. Incremental dollars should be skewed to buybacks given cheap stock valuations and the Fed's preference for the flexibility afforded by repurchases.Best positioned for the highest capital return are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).The highest incremental capital returns should come from Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).The lower end of payout ratios should fall on Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) and Bank of America.Now read: Sell The Banks: The Invisible Hand Is Broken (April 4) Apr. 7, 2016, 12:44 PM | 12 Comments
WSJ: Winners and losers from D.C.'s new retirement rules
The Department of Labor this week is expected to release final regulations requiring brokers to act with a fiduciary standard - that is act solely in the best interest of their client. Previously, recommendations only had to be "suitable" for clients - a less rigorous standard allowing excessive fees, and investments with hidden commissions.Investors now paying trading commissions will likely be moved into accounts where brokers collect fees based on AUM. Popular, but costly products like variable annuities, commodity pools and non-tradable REITs might no longer find a home in retirement accounts. They'll be replaced with low-cost index funds.Whether it all works out for the little guy remains to be seen, but one thing is sure: Regulatory costs will be on the rise, something larger shops - think Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) - are going to be able to absorb better than smaller players who are more reliant on commissions - think LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) and Raymond James (NYSE:RF).Big providers of index mutual funds and ETFs are winners as well - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), and WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) fit the bill. Active mutual fund houses like Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), Legg Mason (NYSE:LM), and Waddell & Reed (NYSE:WDR), not so much.Insurers who are big providers are variable annuities could also be pressured - Ameriprise (NYSE:AMP), Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU).Now read: Congratulations To All The New Fiduciary FAs Out There: Financial Advisors' Daily Digest (April 4) Apr. 5, 2016, 1:23 PM | 19 Comments

Banks lower as JPMorgan warns on energy
Holding its investor day today, JPMorgan said it was going to add another $500M to energy-related loan-loss reserves. This followed a $67M provision in Q4, which at the time brought total oil and gas loss reserves to $815M (vs. a portfolio with book value of $44B).In addition, the bank said it could need to add another $1.5B to reserves should oil hang around $25 per barrel over the next 18 months. For perspective, prior to Q4, JPMorgan hadn't had to add to reserves for six years - in fact reserve releases were a big boost to profits across the industry."When the biggest bank increases reserves for potential oil losses it sets a tone for the industry,” says Mike Mayo.Separately, the FDIC says bad loan provisions across the banking sector were $3.8B higher in Q4 than a year earlier.JPMorgan (JPM -3.5%), Citigroup (C -2.9%), Bank of America (BAC -2.9%), Wells Fargo (WFC -2%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -3%), Regions Financial (RF -3.8%), Comerica (CMA -4.2%), Zions (ZION -4.1%), PNC Financial (PNC -2%).ETFs: KRE, KBE, IAT, KBWB, QABA, KBWR, KRU, KRS Feb. 23, 2016, 2:38 PM | 56 Comments

It wasn't supposed to be this way after the Fed embarked on a rate hike cycle as these yield-starved names could finally look forward to earning a better spread on their money.Since the Fed hiked last month, however, the long bond yield has tumbled about 20 basis points, further narrowing the yield curve.With today's 1.3% decline, the XLF is lower by 7.6% YTD, about 200 basis points worse than the S&P 500 (but about 250 basis points better than the energy sector).TBTFs: Morgan Stanley (MS -3.9%), Goldman Sachs (GS -2.3%), Citigroup (C -1.8%)Regionals: U.S. Bancorp (USB -2%), Regions Financial (RF -3.4%), New York Community Bancorp (NYCB -2.2%)Mortgage-related names like Ocwen (OCN -6.2%), Nationstar (NSM -5.3%), Walter Investment (WAC -13.9%), and New Residential (NRZ -5.3%) have come in for particular punishment this day and this year.

Deutsche downgrades KeyCorp, Regions Financial; prefers Citizens Financial
After nice moves higher of late, the stocks of both KeyCorp (KEY -1.9%) and Regions Financial (RF -1.2%) have priced in several rate increases next year, says analyst Matt O'Connor, downgrading the two to Hold from Buy.In addition, there are risks to KeyCorp's deal to buy First Niagara Financial, like disruption from large expense cuts, regulatory issues, and more tangible book dilution.There may be more upside to be found in Citizens Financial Group (CFG -0.4%), says O'Connor, as that lender is earlier in its turnaround, trades at a 10% discount to Regions, and has less energy-related credit risk.

Goldman sees rebound ahead, lists 25 most oversold stocks
Goldman Sachs analysts say the U.S. stock market correction has many more parallels with 1998 than 2008, which “suggest[s] a rebound ahead,” while predicting the S&P 500 will rise by 11% from current levels to reach 2,100 by year's end.The S&P fell 19% between July and August 1998, but "ultimately, the U.S. economy was relatively unaffected by overseas financial market gyrations in 1998, and we believe a similar situation will occur in 2015," Goldman says.The correlation between U.S. economic growth and Chinese growth is relatively low, Goldman says, estimating that a one percentage point drop in Chinese growth would translate into a 0.06 pp reduction in U.S. GDP.The best strategy for U.S. consumers, the bank advises, is to hold companies with high domestic revenues and avoid companies with high foreign sales.Goldman's list of the 25 most oversold stocks with high U.S. sales exposure: KMX, M, WFM, CHK, SWN, RRC, COG, PXD, OKE, MPC, NAVI, ETFC, LNC, BXP, KEY, RF, DFS, ANTM, CSX, NSC, UNP, JBHT, FSLR, ADS, PAYX Aug. 25, 2015, 10:43 AM | 41 Comments

BAML: Financial bull intact despite Greece
It was a rough start to the year for the financial sector, but at about the mid-point of 2015, the XLF is ahead 9.7%, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 1.8% rise.Calling U.S. Treasury yields "considerably more resilient" today than in 2012 thanks to the strength of the economy, Erika Najarian and team don't expect the Greek crisis to impact the 10-year yield or the timing of the first Fed rate hike.The bottom line, says Najarian, is to expect continued rotation into the financial names, with solid loan performance in Q2 a catalyst on top of the improved interest rate picture.Najarian and team are sticking with their Buy-list of rate-sensitive names: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), East West Bancorp (NASDAQ:EWBC), and Texas Capital Bancshares (NASDAQ:TCBI).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF, FINZ Jul. 6, 2015, 1:31 PM

Financials turn higher for the year
Yield-starved financial sector names were mercilessly punished to start 2015 as sharply falling interest rates in January again disappointed investors waiting for the return of some spread income.The rout in bond prices since, alongside what now seems the near-certainty of the beginning of Fed rate hikes in as soon as three months has helped turn things around, and the sector - as measured by the Financial Select SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) - is now in the green for the year, and trails the S&P 500 by just about 150 basis points.Among the notable movers today as the 10-year yield rises to another 2015 high: Bank of America (BAC +1.4%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.2%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.4%), Regions Financial (RF +1.3%), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN +1.6%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.6%), PNC Financial (PNC +1.3%), M&T (MTB +1.1%), Bank of Hawaii (BOH +1.6%), First Horizon (FHN +1.2%), Lincoln National (LNC +1.1%), E*Trade (ETFC +0.9%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, BTO, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, FINU, QABA, KRU, KBWR, RWW, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, KRS Jun. 9, 2015, 2:45 PM | 16 Comments

Goldman: Any returns over next year coming from dividends
Goldman's sees the S&P 500 hitting a mid-year high of 2,150 by mid-year, but fading to 2,100 by year-end after the Fed hikes rates. Its 12-month forecast of 2,125 stands against the current level of 2,130.With appreciation returns expected to be nil, Goldman suggests having a look at its dividend growth portfolio - a sector-neutral basket of 50 stocks. They have a median yield of 2.5% and are expected to boost payouts by 16% this year and 12% in 2016. The group's P-E ratio is 15 vs. 17.3 for the S&P 500.The ten highest-yielding additions: Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) - with a 2.3% yield, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) - 2.1%, Dr. Pepper Snapple (NYSE:DPS) - 2.5%, National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) - 3.6%, Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) - 2.3%, Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) - 3.1%, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) - 2.4%, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) - 3.9%, International Paper (NYSE:IP) - 3.1%, AES Corp (NYSE:AES) - 3%.Looking over a ten-year horizon, Goldman expects dividends to account for 46% of the S&P 500's 5% annualized return, up from 20% during the current bull market which started in 2009.ETFs: DVY, SCHD, ADX, SDOG, DLN, DHS, FDL, DTD, FVD, DVYL, SDYL May 18, 2015, 3:03 PM | 21 Comments

Regions Financial fined $7.5M for overdraft fees
In addition to the fine from the CFPB, Regions (RF +0.5%) has already refunded customers $49M in fees and will fully refund any remaining customers as necessary. In addition, the bank will have to hire an independent consultant to identify any other customers who may have been illegally charged fees and correct any errors showing up on credit reports.At issue is the bank's charging of overdraft fees to clients who had not opted into the service."We believe the vast majority of the refunds have been completed and we have made changes to our internal systems," says the bank.

Regions Financial PT lifted at Compass Point, rating cut at RBC
Compass Point analyst Kevin Barker reiterates his Buy rating and lifts the price target to $11.50 from $11 following Region's (RF -0.5%) Q1 results yesterday. The move comes as he slightly boosts his 2016 EPS estimates due to increased balance sheet leverage.Barker, however, does take note of a significant increase in provision expense as the bank gets ahead of likely deterioration in loans in healthcare, energy, and other sectors. He expects provisions to remain elevated through next year, but be offset with operating efficiency and balance sheet growth.RBC sees things differently, and throws in the towel on its Outperform rating.Previously: Low-rate "torture" for the regional lenders (April 21)Previously: Regions Financial flat after inline results (April 21) Apr. 22, 2015, 9:56 AM
Low-rate "torture" for the regional lenders
"This whole discussion today about when interest rates move is torture for us,” said U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) CEO Richard Davis on last week's earnings call. “I remain very optimistic for the economy … a little less optimistic for the bankers until interest rates start to move up.”Earlier today, Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) and Fifth Third (NASDAQ:FITB) became the latest in a line of lenders reporting slimming net interest margins. For Regions, the average yield on its loan portfolio fell to 3.45% from 4.03% a year ago. "You’re trying to book the prudent loans that you have the opportunity to, but with the level of competition in the market, it’s hard to move those rates up absent some kind of interest-rate increase," said Regions chief Grayson Hall on the earnings call.On average, U.S. banks with more than $10B in assets showed a NIM of 2.97% in Q4, the lowest level in 25 years according to the FDIC ... And it got worse in Q1. Six of the nine big commercial banks reporting so far - including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and PNC Financial - had Q1 margins lower than Q4.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Regions - two banks seen as particularly sensitive to interest rates - are unsurprisingly the worst performers in the KBW bank index (NYSEARCA:KBE) this year, off 13.9% and 9.3% respectively.What to do? Regions, for one, is trying to emulate the Wall Street big boys by bulking up its wealth management and capital markets operations. And maybe there's some more fat to trim. “We’re going to turn up the heat on expenses…and we’ll see where we get to,” said PNC boss William Demchak on last week's conference call.Source; WSJ's Peter Rudegeair ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, FINU, QABA, KRU, KBWR, RWW, RYF, FINZ, KRS Apr. 21, 2015, 9:37 PM | 9 Comments

Oil fears overblown in banks with energy exposure, Raymond James says
Concerns about loans made to oil companies by energy-friendly regional banks are overblown, Raymond James analysts say, viewing the risk of material credit losses as unlikely given the conservative underwriting process.A sustained pullback in energy prices is certain to impact the Texas economy, although the benefits of lower oil prices on the consumer as well as potential rising interest rates could provide an offset to EPS risk for the banks, Raymond James says.The firm says it would selectively look to add to energy lenders such as Buy-rated Zions (NASDAQ:ZION), Texas Capital (NASDAQ:TCBI) and LegacyTexas Financial (NASDAQ:LTXB), as well as Outperform-rated BB&T (NYSE:BBT), Hancock (NASDAQ:HBHC), MidSouth (NYSE:MSL), Southwest (NASDAQ:OKSB) and Regions Financial (NYSE:RF).

Regions Financial (RF -2.4%) is an outlier to the downside among the regional bank names after KBW analysts Chris Mutascio and Daniel Coffman cut the stock to Underperform from Market Perform.The team feels the idea of higher rates based on Friday's jobs report is overdone, and doesn't see the Fed hiking until late this year, and even then at "an incredibly slow pace.""It is hard for us to see the Fed moving in any significant manner while the rest of the world is fighting off deflationary risks and slowing economies by devaluing their currencies as fast as possible. In other words, we don't see the Fed providing an earnings catalyst for RF any time soon."KBW sees full-year EPS of $0.74 this year and $0.81 next - that's 8% below Street consensus.

Rate hikes coming? Financials up big after jobs number
Financials have been mercilessly pounded in 2015 as hopes for higher interest rates looked like they might be dashed yet again, but today's blowout jobs number - firmly putting a June rate hike on the table - has brought in the dip-buyers.The major averages are flat, but the XLF is up 1.4%. The Regional Bank ETF (KRE +2%) and the Bank ETF (KBE +2.1%) are doing even better.Among the yield-starved banking names: Bank of America (BAC +3.1%), JPMorgan (JPM +2.6%), Citigroup (C +2%), Regions Financial (RF +4%), KeyCorp (KEY +3%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.9%), SunTrust (STI +2.3%), Zions (ZION +3.6%), Synovus (SNV +2.3%).Insurers: MetLife (MET +2%), Prudential (PRU +3.2%), Lincoln National (LNC +4.6%). AIG (AIG +1.5%).Trust banks: BNY Mellon (BK +2.7%) State Street (STT +1.9%), Northern Trust (NTRS +2.3%).Online brokers (currently getting killed on money-market fee rebates): Schwab (SCHW +4.5%), TD Ameritrade (AMTD +3.5%), E*Trade (ETFC +2.1%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, KIE, IAT, IAI, SEF, IYG, IAK, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, KBWP, KBWI, PSCF, FINZ, KRS Feb. 6, 2015, 9:50 AM | 49 Comments
Financials go on sale in January
The financial sector is off to a worse start to the year than even the energy names, with the XLF down 3.9% YTD vs. the XLE's 3.2% decline. The S&P 500 is roughly flat. The SPDR KBW Bank ETF (NYSEARCA:KBE) is off 7.5%, and the Regional Bank ETF (NYSEARCA:KRE) is lower by 6.9%.Q4 earnings results haven't been wonderful, but financial names had been savaged well before those reports started coming out. Instead there's a difficult regulatory regime that won't quit, and - for now - it's looking like "wait'll next year" for the rising interest rates that were supposed to drive profit margins higher. The 10-year/2-year spread - already pretty low at 150 basis points to start the year - has narrowed to 137 bps.A partial roll call of banks: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) -12.1% YTD, Citigroup (NYSE:C) -10.1%, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) -9.4%, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) -9.4%, Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) -14.7%, KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) -4.5%, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) -5.4%, Bank of New York (NYSE:BK) -9.1%, Capital One (NYSE:COF) -6%, Discover (NYSE:DFS) -13.6%.Other spread-starved sector names: MetLife (NYSE:MET) -9.8%, AIG (NYSE:AIG) -8%, Prudential (NYSE:PRU) -10.8%, Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) -9.9%.Some of what's working in financials: Blackstone (NYSE:BX) +6.7%, E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) +1.2%, WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) +12.3%, Legg Mason +2.8%.

Banks, insurers hit hard as higher rate assumption in question
Bank earnings models will no doubt need to be tweaked as the sure thing of higher rates becomes somewhat less sure, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield plunging all the way down to 2%, and 30-day Fed Funds futures - just weeks ago pricing in 100% chance of a rate hike by June 2015 - now sees no move until December 2015.The XLF is lower by 1.9% and the Regional Banking ETF (NYSEARCA:KRE) is down 2.1% (the S&P 500 is off a mere 1.1%).

Supreme Court ruling may make it harder for shareholders to file class action suits
In the next several weeks, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case involving a shareholders' class action lawsuit against Haliburton (HAL). If it rules in favor of the company, it will set a higher bar for plaintiffs to achieve class certification. Currently, a judge holds a certification hearing to decide whether class status is appropriate. One criterion is that the people must have common issues. If HAL prevails,  then the defendants will be able to file a brief with the court demanding that the shareholders have to again seek court approval for class status under a new, tougher standard. If they fail the gain the approval, the case ends.HAL is trying to overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, which is based on "fraud on the market theory," which postulates that a defendant's material misrepresentation that affects the price of publicly traded securities is assumed to have been relied upon by a buyer who suffered a loss. In HAL's case, shareholders alleged that it understated its asbestos liabilities while overstating revenues and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries.Other firms facing class action suits that would benefit from a favorable ruling are Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBC), Regions Financial (RF) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS).

Regions expects noninterest revenue to move higher in Q2
Noninterest revenue of $438M in Q1 fell from $526M the previous quarter and $501M a year ago, but Regions (RF -0.5%) - presenting at the Morgan Stanley financials conference - says Q1 may have been the trough.Webcast and presentation slides While industry mortgage production is expected to be lower by 40% this year, Regions expects just a 20-25% decline for itself. Hoping to offset this falloff, Regions is planning to expand small credit product offerings.Alongside the drift upward in noninterst revenue, management expects the efficiency ratio - 66.9% in Q1 - to drift lower (a good  thing).

Smaller banks next in line over mortgages
First they came for the big banks, and I did nothing ... The nation's largest lenders nearly sucked dry from mortgage settlements, housing regulators have turned their attention to a number of smaller players, with Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), SunTrust (STI), and Regions Financial (RF) all recently disclosing investigations into the origination and servicing of home loans. U.S. Bancorp (USB) and Capital One (COF) have also disclosed probes into various mortgage practices.Any money recouped from the regional lenders would go a long way towards stabilizing the finances of the FHA which required a $1.7B taxpayer infusion last year. "Settling with the large guys gave [the government] a template," says Eric Wasserstrom from Robinson Humphrey. "The agencies involved in the national mortgage settlement had planned to focus on the largest mortgage servicers first," says the Iowa assistant AG.

Still room to run for Regions Financial?
Under current CEO Grayson Hall who took over four years ago, Regions (RF) has cleaned up problem loans, cut costs, and boosted its presence in some thriving sectors of business lending, writes Lawrence Strauss in this week's Barron's, and is also making all the right moves in key growth fields like mobile banking and wealth management.Yes, the first quarter was a hiccup as profits fell thanks to a decline in mortgage lending, but this was industry-wide and Regions is less dependent on residential mortgage business than peers (accounts for 16% of all loans at RF). Regions' focus is commercial and industrial loans, and these grew 11% Y/Y.Interest rates? Regions - thanks to nearly industry-low funding costs - saw a boost in its net interest margin in Q1 while many competitors posted declines. And when rates do rise, the bank - says CEO Hall - is "better positioned than most" to benefit.Then there's capital. The bank's Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% is roughly 300 basis points higher than required. Other than supporting continued loan growth, a 2% dividend, and a $350M buyback (approved by the Fed), the money is there for some real expansion. "You could see them using that capital via M&A to fill in a number of markets where they don't have the density they need," says Goldman's Ryan Nash. May 3, 2014, 8:49 AM | 1 Comment

Noninterest expense fell to $817M from $842M.Loan loss allowance as a percentage of loans falls to 1.67% from 2.37% one year ago.Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% rose from 10.6% at year's end.

Regions no longer a Buy at Miller Tabak; First Midwest upgraded
A late-Tuesday downgrade of Regions Financial (RF -1.7%) by analyst Thomas Mitchell is moving the stock today. It's a valuation call, with Miller pulling his Buy rating after recent outperformance by stock (it's up roughly 40% over the past year vs. about 30% for the KBW Bank Index). Regions, says Mitchell, "remains challenged to accumulate enough new capital to grow the business faster."In another move, Mitchell pulls his Sell rating on underperforming First Midwest Bancorp (FMBI -0.6%), saying the lender "has (finally) emerged from the very difficult credit quality conditions it had long faced as a result of lending on undeveloped land parcels back in the mid-2000's."

Fed set to say whether approves bank plans to return money to investors
The Federal Reserve is due to say today whether it approves banks' plans to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock. The process is spread out over a week so that banks can alter their programs if they don't receive Fed authorization.Last year, the Fed told JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to change their capital-allocation plans.The Fed's decision will come a week after it said that 29 out of 30 banks had passed its stress tests.Relevant tickers include C, MS, BAC, BK, AXP, COF, C, FITB, PNC, RF, STT, STI, USB, WFC, ZION.ETFs of interest: KBE, KBWB, KRE, KCE, KBWC, XLF, IYF, PFI, VFH, RYF, RWW, FAS, UYG, FAZ, SKF, SEF, IAI, FXO, PSCF, KBWD, KBWB, IYG, FINU, FINZ.

More on Fed stress test results
Again, all 30 lenders subject to the Fed stress test passed with the exception of Zions Bancorp. Checking the individual results:Regional banks passing: BB&T Corp. (BBT), Comerica (CMA), Fifth Third (FITB), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), M&T (MTB), PNC, Regions (RF), SunTrust (STI), U.S. Bancorp (USB).Credit card lenders: American Express (AXP), Discover (see here), Capital One (COF).Those controlled by overseas holding companies: BBVA Compass, BMO FInancial, HSBC North America, RBS Citizens Financial, Santander Holdings USA (SAN), UnionBanCal (MTU).Trust banks: Bank of New York (BK), State Street (STT), Northern Trust (NTRS).TBTFs: See here.More on Zions (ZION): The failure likely has something to do with CDOs on its books backed by trust-preferred securities. The bank signaled earlier this year it would likely resubmit its capital plan to the Fed as the test's calculation of its capital ratio wouldn't reflect Zion's planned sale of these.

Markit expects major dividend hikes at BofA and Citi
Expecting dividends to grow 49% on average for the banks subject to the Fed's stress tests (about the same as last year), Markit, says Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) will lead the way with 400% boosts. "They are the last of the major banks paying minimal dividends ... change is overdue."While 400% is a big number, Citi and BofA will continue to lag their peers in terms of yield (400% growth on a penny just leads to a nickel).Also expected to have a significant pop is Morgan Stanley (MS) - a doubling of the payout to $0.10 per share and a 1.4% yield. Others in the top 5 in increases are Zions Bancorp (ZION) with a 75% boost to $0.07 and Regions Financial (RF) up 67% to $0.05.The others: KEY +27%, HBAN +20%, BK +20%, STI +20%, COF +17%, DFS +15%, AXP +13%, STT +12%, JPM +11%, CMA +11%, PNC +9%, USB +9%, GS +9%, FITB +8%, WFC +7%, NTRS +6%, and no soup for BBT and MTB where the dividends are expected to be flat at $0.23 and $0.70 per share, respectively.As for ETFs, the dividend jumps are expected to have the biggest impact on the XLF which would see a 25% increase in payout: The ETF has 81 companies, but the top 5 holdings - BofA, Wells, JPM, Citi, USB - make up 41% of assets. In contrast, just two CCAR banks make up the top five holdings of the KBE and it should see a more muted increase of just 18%.Related ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, RKH, QABA, FNCL, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ Feb. 20, 2014, 3:29 PM | 13 Comments
Regions adjusted EPS beats by a penny
Adjusted EPS of $0.21 is a penny higher than expectations. Among the extraordinary items is a transfer of troubled loans into the held-for-sale bin resulting in an after-tax charge of $46M.Net interest income up 1% Q/Q with NIM up 2 bps to 3.26% (up 16 bps from a year ago).Noninterest revenue of $526M up 6.2% from a year ago, with mortgage revenue off 23%.Adjusted noninterest expense is roughly flat from a year ago.Charge-offs and loan-loss provision comparisons are tricky thanks to the above-mentioned move.Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.6% gains 10 basis points from last year.RF -2.1% premarket Jan. 21, 2014, 7:39 AM

Regions drops controversial loan program
The Ready Advance program - which provided revolving credit lines to checking account customers and charged a 10% cash advance fee in addition to the interest - had come under attack from consumer groups.Regions (RF +2.7%) announces a new program - the Savings Secured Loan - up to a $250 line available to savings account customers.

Banks could face tougher stress tests next year
The Fed intends to use its own estimates about the effect of a recession on bank balance sheets in its stress tests. Previously, the Fed has relied on data from the firms themselves.The central bank could project that bank assets would grow during a slump, as has happened in the past three recessions, rather than fall, as the banks have predicted.With such a finding, the Fed could require banks to hold more loss-absorbing capital or limit shareholder payouts.

Loan growth and margins catch up at Regions
Year-over-year loan growth of about 1.2% the last two quarters was slightly ahead of Regions' (RF -0.2%) community bank peers, says CEO Grayson Hall at the Goldman Sachs conference. Previous quarters were notable for Regions' loan growth being both negative and well below that of its competitors.Webcast and presentation slides The bank also posted the best boost to net interest margins in the industry over the past year, and now sports a NIM of 3.24% vs. the peer average of 3.29%. One year ago, Regions' NIM was 39 basis points less than the industry average. Dec. 10, 2013, 10:46 AM

CS: Investors may want to dial back bank capital return hopes
New CCAR guidelines are largely inline with last year, says the team at Credit Suisse, but some variables pose more onerous assumptions and could keep capital distributions more conservative than otherwise expected, though still improved from last year.The incorporation of a large counterparty default scenario is particularly of note for those banks with material trading and custodial operations. The bar for CCAR passage is thus raised for: BAC, BK, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, and WFC.Additionally, the weakening of economic activity in the severely adverse scenario appears worse than last year. Also included is a reversal in the recent improvement in U.S. housing and the European economy.Those best-positioned for excess capital deployment: AXP, HBAN, KEY, NTRS, RF, and USB. Bank of New York, Goldman, State Street, and Wells Fargo all have the honor of ending up on both lists.ETFs: KBE, KBWB. Nov. 5, 2013, 12:48 PM
Regions removed from Goldman's Conviction Buy list

Regions Financial loses Buy rating at SunTrust
SunTrust's Eric Wasserstrom is cautious due to the impact of continuing high operating expenses and cuts to Hold with price target reduced to $10.50 from $11.50.Regions (RF) yesterday reported flat sequential noninterest expenses, but headcount was higher by 376. The behavior stands in contrast to most other banks who continue to try and slash expenses. Regions "continues to prudently invest for the future," said the company in the earnings release. "If the revenue does not materialize, we will reduce expenses accordingly," said CFO David Turner on the earnings call (transcript).Q3 results.Shares -0.8% premarket after yesterday's 3.6% decline.

Regions also hit by refinance slowdown
Net interest income of $824M up 2% from Q2, with net interest margin of 3.24% up eight basis points thanks to lower funding costs.Noninterest income of $495M is slightly lower than Q2, led by a 16% decline in mortgage production volume. Mortgage income of $17M is off from $52M last quarter. New home originations jump to 60% of total from 37% as refinancing disappears.Noninterest expense of $884M is flat from Q2, but headcount is up 376.

Regional banks slide as taper had been priced in
Regional banks have fallen and can't get up following yesterday afternoon's non-taper announcement. The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE -1.7%) is off about 3% from where it stood prior to 2 PM ET yesterday.The sector sliced right through the bond market tumble this summer as higher rates were expected to boost profitability for the lenders, and investors are using the excuse of the taper delay to cash in some chips (as they are with another higher-rate beneficiary, the insurance sector).Individual names of note: Huntington (HBAN -2%), Regions (RF -3.7%), SunTrust (STI -3.1%), First NIagara (FNFG -2.8%), Synovus (SNV -1.8%), KeyCorp (KEY -3.9%), ZIons (ZION -3.1%), Flagstar (FBC -2.3%).Perhaps a little less asset-sensitive and performing better: U.S. Bancorp (USB -0.4%), BB&T (BBT -0.3%), PNC Financial (PNC -0.5%), Hudson CIty (HCBK -0.9%), Fifth Third (FITB -1%).Other ETFs: KBE, KBWB.

Regional players liking rising rates

Rising rates mean hiked price targets for regional banks
BMO Capital's Lana Chan plugs Fed rate hikes into her models and raises price targets on eight regional banks. Her assumptions are rate hikes beginning in mid-2015 and totaling 100 bps by the end of the year, with another 100 bps of hikes by the middle of 2016 - a total off 200 basis points over one year.Hold-rated BB&T (BBT +0.3%) is upped to $40 from $38, Comerica (CMA -0.2%) to $42 from $41, PNC Financial (PNC -0.7%) to $78 from $76, SunTrust (STI -0.3%) to $36 from $35, U.S. Bancorp (USB -0.4%) to $39 from $38, and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.1%) to $47 from $46.M&T Bank (MTB -0.7%) - still awaiting approval of its buyout of Hudson City Bancorp (HCBK -0.6%) - is lifted to $124 from $117.Buy-rated Fifth Third (FITB -1.3%) with price target $22, KeyCorp (KEY -0.4%) with price target $14, and Zions (ZION -1.7%) with price target $33 receive no boost, but Regions Financial (RF -0.1%) is lifted to $13 from $12.Many banks disclose their own analysis - but these (probably like Chan's) assume a "parallel" increase in rates in which the yield curve shape doesn't change. By their own analysis, Zions see itself benefitting more than its competitors, with net interest income to rise 18.1% on a 200 bp parallel increase in rates.Regional bank ETFs: IAT, KBE, KRE, RKH, QABA, KRU, KRS, KBWR.

"Green sprouts" of revenue growth for smaller banks
"We have seen a better economy, we saw better credit growth, but now we are seeing better loan growth," says KBW's Jeff Harralson, bullish on the regional and community banking sectors (KRE, KBWR). "We're seeing the first hints of banks beginning to raise the loan rates ... very positive for their earnings."Regionals are generally considered those with less than $50B in assets, community banks are those with less than $10B.Dick Bove agrees, with Regions Financial (RF), SunTrust (STI), and BB&T (BBT) his favorites in the sector.."It's a credit recovery story that finally turned the corner," says RayJay's Michael Rose, noting United Community Banks (UCBI) of northern Georgia as one with credit issues but room to grow.Don't forget M&A activity, adds Harralson, noting both PacWest Bancorp (PACW) and CapitalSource (CSE) jumped on the day of their merger announcement. Others that might benefit from deals are SCBT Financial (SCBT) of South Carolina and Prosperity Bancshares (PB) of Houston. Aug. 8, 2013, 1:04 PM

A Goldman Sachs note helps explain some of the recent weakness in big bank stocks and adds a warning signal: Banks that gain more than 10% in Q1 usually give back nearly all those profits in Q2 when future earnings estimates begin falling. Goldman's top concern heading into Q1 earnings is that "lackluster fundamentals could lead to a negative EPS revision cycle (which has been the trend the past few years)."

If Regions Financial (RF -7%), its shares down nearly 50% YTD, wants to get out from under its $3.5B TARP bill, it may have to accept a low-ball bid for its Morgan Keegan brokerage.

A consortium including Blackstone (BX) and Carlyle is among the finalists to buy Regions Financial's (RF) Morgan Keegan brokerage and investment banking unit, which has a book value of $1.5B, Reuters reports.

Markets sniff out weakness, and the relentless selling in financials may be no more than frontrunning John Paulson, whose Advantage Plus fund is reportedly off 47% through September's end. Redemptions - perhaps massive ones - are a possibility, meaning Paulson will have to unload financial shares, and others, he has been so fond of. One could do worse than picking a bottom in the XLF on the day he is forced to give up on the sector. Oct. 8, 2011, 8:44 PM | 12 Comments
Treasury may have to play a waiting game to get its TARP loans paid back, according to Sandler O'Neill analyst Kevin Fitzsimmons. A fall in stock prices has increased the size of TARP payments relative to market caps, making it trickier for banks to raise money via debt or equity offerings. Banks stuck holding an unwieldy tab: RF, ZION, SNV, BPOP, (full TARP scorecard).

Financial shares are again a sea of red in an otherwise mixed market.
