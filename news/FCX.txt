Strike at Freeport's Cerro Verde mine may end next week, union says
The ongoing strike at Peru's Cerro Verde copper mine may end next week if the labor ministry declares it illegal, the head of the union says after negotiations with owner Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) ended without an agreement.Workers began the strike on Friday to demand better family health benefits and a bigger share of the mine's profits, but they risk losing their jobs if the ministry says the strike is illegal and they do not return to work, the union president says.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Today, 9:17 AM | 3 Comments
Strike at Freeport's Cerro Verde mine in day four; union says output at 50%
A strike at Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru is now in its fourth day after a meeting between the union and management failed to resolve a dispute over labor demands.The union says Cerro Verde, Peru's biggest copper mine, is producing only half as much copper as usual because FCX has hired contract workers to operate key areas; the mine produced nearly 500K metric tons of copper in 2016, more than double its 2015 output, thanks to an expansion.~1,300 workers out of 1,650 left their jobs Friday to demand family health benefits and a bigger share of the mine's profits.FCX owns a 53.56% stake in Cerro Verde, Sumitomo Metal Mining has 21% and Buenaventura (NYSE:BVN) has 19.58 percent.

Global miners move higher as China affirms capacity cuts
China's steel and iron ore futures resume their climb overnight, surging a respective 5.9% and 4.3%, after the head of China’s Ministry of Information and Technology reaffirmed the government’s resolve to cut excess capacity in the steel sector.Today's strength also is attributed to seasonal demand, as Chinese construction activity picks up after a slowdown over winter.Among relevant tickers: SLX +2.4%, BHP +2.1%, RIO +3.5%, VALE +4.1%, CLF +4%, X +3.9%, MT +4.2%, AKS +3%, WOR +2.7%, FCX +2.3%, TECK +2.6%, AA +2.4%, CENX +1.7%, ACH +1.2%, KALU +1%.

Strike halts output at Freeport's Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru
Workers at Freeport McMoRan's (FCX -0.6%) Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru have started an indefinite strike that halted production of ~40K oz./month, a union official says.The union initially scheduled a five-day strike but voted this week to stop work indefinitely to push for family health benefits and a bigger share of the mine's profits.Cerro Verde, Peru's biggest copper mine, more than doubled its production last year to nearly 500K oz. because of an expansion; FCX owns a 53.5% stake, Sumitomo Metal owns 21% and Buenaventura (BVN +1.7%) holds 19.5%.

Indonesia will not budge on divestment rule for Freeport, minister says
Indonesia's government will not back down from new rules requiring Freeport McMoran (FCX -0.5%) to divest a majority stake in its local unit, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan tells Reuters.New rules require FCX to give up its 1991 contract before it can resume exports of copper concentrate, divest a 51% stake in its Indonesian unit, pay more taxes, and build a second copper smelter; the government is willing to "sit down and have more beneficial solutions for both sides," Jonan says, but "the 51% [rule] is mandatory."FCX earlier this week cut its Grasberg copper mining target and shelved plans to invest $1B/year in a long-term underground expansion, and CEO Richard Adkerson warned the dispute could go to arbitration if there was no resolution by mid-June.

Freeport McMoRan sees "no return to business as usual" in Indonesia
Freeport McMoRan's (FCX +2.7%) Indonesian unit sees "no returning to business as usual," according to an internal company memo, after the company cut production and laid off workers at its Grasberg copper mine in a battle with the government over mining rights.Reuters reports that the unit said in a memo to staff yesterday that it had shelved plans to invest $1B/year in long-term underground expansion at Grasberg, and that copper ore output from the mine would be cut to 95K metric tons/day in 2017 from 140K metric tons previously estimated.The Indonesian unit says its actions are "painful but necessary" in ensuring survival while it works with the government to reach a solution to resume exporting copper concentrate.

Shareholders want Freeport McMoRan to get tough with Indonesia, CEO says
Shareholders are pressuring Freeport McMoRan (FCX +1.9%) to stand up to the Indonesian government over changes the country wants to make in the miner's contract, with many of them believing FCX has "been too nice," CEO Richard Adkerson says.The CEO says Rio Tinto (RIO +1.4%), a partner in FCX's Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, also supports the company's tougher approach.In some of his strongest language yet, Adkerson says Indonesia's new regulations are "in effect a form of expropriation of our assets, and we are resisting it aggressively."FCX remains locked in a standoff with the Indonesian government over permission to export copper concentrate produced at Grasberg, which accounts for about a third of its annual copper production and 40%-50% of the value of its worldwide assets.

Freeport McMoRan, Indonesia at impasse over Grasberg mine
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) -3.4% premarket after failing to reach an agreement with Indonesia's government to resume copper concentrate exports.FCX, whose majority-owned Grasberg mine in Indonesia is the world’s second largest copper mine, says it will not accept the government's terms that would allow it to resume shipments of copper concentrate for a year but switch to an operating license, the terms of which dictate the company eventually would have to give up control of the mine.FCX says it is unwilling to revisit the terms of its current 30-year contract to mine at Grasberg, which accounts for about a third of its annual copper production and 40%-50% of the value of its worldwide assets; CEO richard Adkerson says FCX will consider going to arbitration if the dispute is not resolved within the next 120 days.Also over the weekend, Freeport Indonesia CEO Chappy Hakim resigned after holding the job for only a few months.The events prompt Deutsche Bank analysts to downgrade FCX to Sell with a $12.50 price target, cut from $14; the fiirm now expects Grasberg to operate on a scaled-back mode to supply only local the Gresik smelter for the rest of the year, with underground development and ramp-up delayed further.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Tue, Feb. 21, 7:59 AM | 89 Comments
Freeport gets Indonesian OK to resume copper exports for a year
Indonesia's mining ministry recommends granting a permit to Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) to allow the export of 1.1M metric tons of copper concentrates for one year.The government says it issued the recommendations based on a commitment to develop a smelter in Indonesia, adding that progress would be evaluated independently at least every six months.The announcement comes after exports had stopped for more than a month and production at FCX's giant Grasberg mine had been halted, helping push copper prices higher; ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM

Freeport halts production at Indonesian copper mine
Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) Indonesian unit says it has halted production of concentrate at the Grasberg copper mine and has begun to send workers home.FCX previously said it would need to cut production to ~40% of capacity if it did not get a mining export permit from the government by mid-February, due to limited storage.Although the government said last week it had issued the new permit, FCX said no agreement had been reached on the terms that were "necessary and critical" for its long-term investment plans, and that an export ban remained in place.

Global miners move higher alongside copper prices
Global mining stocks extend recent gains on the back of stronger metals prices, with copper rising to its highest level since May 2015 as the world's two biggest mines face production stoppages.Shares in BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP), Rio TInto (NYSE:RIO), Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY), Anglo American (OTCPK:AAUKF, OTCPK:AAUKY) and Antofagasta (OTC:ANFGF) are higher by 1.7%-2.2% in London trading; Vale (NYSE:VALE) +4.6%, Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF) +2.4%, Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) +1.6% in premarket U.S. trading.Copper recently traded traded at $6,126/metric ton after jumping more than 4% on Friday, its biggest one-day rise in nearly four years.BHP declared force majeure at its Escondida mine in Chile on Friday, and the mine was attacked over the weekend by vandals who forced contract workers to stop work during an ongoing strike.At the same time, exports at FCX's Grasberg site in Indonesia have been suspended for a month."In the near term, copper prices should continue to trade on headlines from Escondida as well as from the large Grasberg mine in Indonesia, which is also at risk of production disruptions if an export permit is not granted by the government in the coming weeks," J.P. Morgan says.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Mon, Feb. 13, 8:25 AM | 5 Comments

Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.6%) is downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at J.P. Morgan, as analyst Michael Gambardella sees little upside in the stock at current elevated copper prices.Gambardella also thinks the labor dispute at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia could drag on, which could continue to weigh on FCX shares.While JPM does not expect any more significant asset sales, he thinks FCX could divest its remaining oil and gas assets or sell a bigger stake in Grasberg.

Goldman bullish on copper; Chinese demand seen rising alongside mine strikes
Analysts say copper prices could rise further if disruptions at the world's two largest copper mines persist, as workers at BHP Billiton's (BHP +0.6%) Escondida mine begin their expected strike and a new export permit at Freeport McMoRan's (FCX -1.2%) Grasberg mine has yet to be granted after the prior permit expired nearly a month ago.An already-bullish Goldman Sachs notes that the supply disruptions come just as China's economy appears to be on the mend: “The timing of these disruptions is important since... they would be occurring over the same period as we expect to see a strong seasonal and cyclical uptick in Chinese demand post Chinese New Year and into the second quarter of 2017.”China’s GDP grew 6.8% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, slightly beating expectations, in a sign for some analysts that sluggish growth has turned the corner.The two mines are expected to produce about 9% of world mine supply this year, Goldman estimates, also noting potential supply risk in Rio Tinto’s (RIO -0.1%) Bingham Canyon copper mine in Utah where contracts are due to expire in March.Macquarie, which recently raised its copper price forecast by 9.3% to $5,850/metric ton, expects the Escondida strike to last a week or two, reducing global supply by as much as 45K metric tons.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM

Rio Tinto considering exit from giant Grasberg mine in indonesia
Rio Tinto (RIO -1%) could walk away from its interest in the huge Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia amid uncertainties over the future operation of the mine, CEO Jean-Sebastian Jacques reportedly said at an analyst briefing."Everyone was taken by surprise," the CEO said, referring to Indonesia's halt of copper exports from Grasberg, which mine operator Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.5%) has warned could force it to cut production and its local workforce.A strike at Indonesia's biggest copper smelter, which is FCX's only domestic buyer of copper concentrate, has added to pressure on the partnership.Rio will decide in "coming weeks and months" whether to sell or exit its option to take an effective 40% stake in Grasberg in 2021, Jacques said.

Copper supply threatened as disruptions rage at top BHP, Freeport mines
BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) says it will halt production at its Escondida mine in Chile, the biggest copper producer, as workers set to begin a strike today after talks between the union and management broke down after a period of government mediation.Meanwhile, Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) warns it will scale back activities at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia amid a smelter strike and issues over renewal of its mining permit.Escondida and Grasberg are the world's biggest copper mines; BHP -1.4%, FCX -0.6% premarket.Copper prices, already +6.5% YTD, rise to as high as $5,920/ton in LME trading, and Goldman Sachs says prices could exceed its six-month target of $6,200/ton because of potential supply disruptions, including at Escondida.Analysts say the events in in Chile, the world's top copper producer, could encourage wage disputes at other large mines, including large zinc mines in Peru.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM

Freeport, still waiting for government action, threatens to cut Indonesia ops
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -2.7%) says approval from Indonesian authorities for the export of its copper concentrates still has not been granted, and threatens to cut costs, staff and spending in Indonesia in the "near-term" if there is continued delay in government approval.FCX says each month of delay in obtaining approval to export means production would be reduced by 70M lbs. of copper and 70K oz. of gold.FCX's exports of copper concentrate from Indonesia have been halted since Jan. 12 when a ban on shipping semi-processed ore out of the country came into effect to boost the local smelter industry.

Copper tops $6K/ton as Escondida mine strike looms
Copper prices rise above $6,000/ton before pulling back, as workers at BHP Billiton's (NYSE:BHP) Escondida copper mine in Chile - the world's largest - have voted to reject a company wage offer and go on strike.The strike is due to begin in 48 hours but likely will be postponed for a five-day government mediation to attempt a resolution.The Escondida mine's 980K tons of copper production in 2016 accounted for 5% of global output, according to Commerzbank.Copper prices already have climbed 32% over the past 12 months, helped by hopes for higher infrastructure spending from the new U.S. administration on the demand side, and the interruption to supplies from Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) Grasberg mine in Indonesia - the world’s second biggest copper mine - as well as disruptions around FCX’s Cerro Verde mine in Peru and some shipping delays because of poor weather in Peru impacting supply.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Wed, Feb. 1, 7:44 AM | 8 Comments
Indonesia to temporarily exempt Freeport from some new mining rules
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) +1.8% premarket as Indonesia will temporarily exempt its local unit from some new rules while processing its application for new mining rights, potentially allowing for the resumption of copper concentrate exports.However, comments from Indonesia's mining ministry do not specify which of the new rules, which require FCX to pay more taxes and divest a 51% stake, the company would be temporarily exempted from.FCX is one of Indonesia's biggest taxpayers, paying more than $16B in taxes, royalties, dividends and other payments during 1992-2015, and has warned that the halt to its shipments since the new mining rules took effect on Jan. 12 could lead to much lower production at its Grasberg mine.

Freeport CEO Adkerson warns on Indonesian production
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -3.2%) warns it would need to start cutting production and jobs at its Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia by mid-February if it fails to get an export permit from the government.CEO RIchard Adkerson said in today's earnings conference call that FCX has told the Indonesian government that it would need to cut Grasberg output to ~40% of capacity if it cannot export.Indonesia's recently imposed ban on shipping semi-processed ore out of the country has removed more than 2% of supply from the global copper market, Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina estimates, which has helped copper prices hit two-month highs of $5,973/metric ton today.Adkerson says FCX has received "indications" from the government that it would be allowed to resume exports while it negotiates converting its contract of work to a special mining license under new mining sector rules.The situation "is likely to get worse before it gets better," LaFemina says.

Freeport loses $188M tax appeal, Indonesian provincial government says

D.R. Horton, Shell, FCX, senior loans among picks at Barron's Roundtable
via Barron's RoundtableDelphi Management's Scott Black reloads his D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) idea from the Midyear Roundtable, noting it's a rare homebuilder with positive free cash flow and low debt. Affordability, however, is an issue - the company says 22-23% of would-be customers looking for financing don't qualify.He's a fan of Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH), noting the stock has been punished alongside other health care names over worries about price increases, but Zimmer's prices have declined 1-3% over the past two years. D.C. can't accuse it of price-gauging. Competitors like Stryker (NYSE:SYK) and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) have substantially higher multiples.Other picks are Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) for its hefty yield, and a more speculative play in Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), whose balance sheet is improving and which stands to reap $410M in EBITDA for every dime increase in the price of copper.Jeff Gundlach likes to look at the ratio of copper-to-gold to predict the direction of bonds - a rise in July signaled 2016's selloff, and it's come down a bit of late, supporting the modest rally.He's looking for investments without much rate risk, and likes Putnam Premier Income Trust (NYSE:PPT) trading at an 11% discount to NAV. The duration is just 0.3. Buying this is like buying the 10-year Treasury yielding 4% when it's actually (as of time of Roundtable) just 2.375%. He's also a fan of PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio (NYSEARCA:BKLN), which has its share of credit risk, but little rate risk.

Freeport seeks guarantees from Indonesia in new mining rules
Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) Indonesian unit says it is seeking fiscal and legal guarantees from the government over mining rules issued last week.The new regulations mean that FCX could be allowed to keep exporting ore if it meets conditions including shifting from current "contracts of work" to "special mining permits," which could increase tax payments to the government.FCX says it would shift away from a contract of work and develop an additional smelter within five years as long as it obtains "a stability agreement providing the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under its contract of work."Although the mining ministry still has not issued a recommendation for FCX to obtain an export permit, the company says it expects to be allowed to resume concentrate exports while new license and requested guarantees are finalized.

Congo's government has dropped objections to Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.3%) and Lundin Mining’s $3.8B combined sales of one of the country’s biggest mines to Chinese companies, ending to an eight-month dispute.FCX in May agreed to sell its 56% stake in the Tenke Fungurume Mining project to China Molybdenum for $2.65B, and in November Lundin said it was selling its 24% stake to a Chinese P-E firm for at least $1.14B.State-owned miner Gecamines, which owns the other 20% of Tenke, no longer opposes the deals, Bloomberg reports, saying the parties have reached an agreement that will provide some financial compensation to Gecamines as well as the right to more consultation and control should the future owners of the asset decide to sell it.

Freeport-McMoRan closes California asset sale for $592M
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX -2.2%) says it's wrapped a sale of its onshore California properties for $592M.The cash deal closes the transfer of the properties to Sentinel Peak Resources California, and brings Freeport's total asset sale transactions in 2016 to $6.6B.Freeport maintains the right to get additional proceeds of $50M per year for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the Brent crude price averages $70/barrel or more in the year in question (it's at $56.75 today).

Copper supply from major Freeport mine threatened as export ban looms
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.6%) CEO Richard Adkerson, owner of the massive Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, says he is confident a pending government ban on overseas concentrate shipments will be resolved by a Jan. 11 deadline.The CEO also told a conference in the U.S. last week that without a resolution, FCX would have to cut back operations and potentially curb development of the underground mine where it is spending $1B/year.The CRU Group consultancy tells Bloomberg it believes the rules will be revised and FCX will be able to continue to export Grasberg concentrates, but that it may not happen before Jan. 11, when the current export license also is due to expire, so a disruption to exports is possible; the firm base case forecast assumes that any disruption does not continue long enough to result in a cutback in production.FCX also is seeking clarity on the conditions that will permit it to operate in the country beyond 2021 when the 30-year term on its contract expires, as well as the requirement to build a new smelter so it can continue to export concentrate under government rules.

Landslide kills 13 as illegal diggers invade Freeport's Temke mine in Congo
A landslide killed at least 13 people last week in the Democratic Republic of Congo after thousands of artisanal miners began invading Freeport McMoRan's (FCX +5.6%) Temke copper mine, according to the Lualaba provincial governor.Between 5K-10K illegal miners have descended on the Tenke copper mine, one of the world's largest, in the past week for reasons that are not entirely clear.Tens of thousands of people in the area depend on small-scale mining to support their families and often operate within the perimeters of industrial mines, using rudimentary tools, sometimes resulting in deadly accidents.

Freeport again go-to copper play, Cowen says in upping target to $20
Freeport McMoRan's (FCX +4.1%) stock price target is raised to $20 from $15 at Cowen, which says the stock has regained its status as the go-to copper investment vehicle after impressive actions taken by management to right-size the balance sheet.FCX shares could re-rate higher as the implied copper price in shares is well below current spot prices, Cowen says in maintaining its Outperform rating.The firm says FCX maintains significant leverage to improving copper prices, in spite of recent copper asset divestitures, and notes that every $0.10/lb. move in copper prices results in a ~$410M change in 2017 EBITDA.

Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has secured a 5% drop in charges it will pay China's biggest copper smelter, Jiangxi Copper, to process its concentrate for 2017, Reuters reports, in a deal that sets the benchmark for the region.FCX reportedly will pay $92.50/metric ton and $.0925/pound for treatment and refining charges, in the second annual cut in a row and down from $.0975/metric ton for term contracts this year, as a surge in supply mostly from Peru begins to fade out; spot charges are at ~$105.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Nov. 17, 2016, 9:17 AM | 2 Comments
Copper execs pour cold water on "irrational" price rally
Global copper markets will be oversupplied for at least two years, according to executives at some of the world's top copper producers, casting doubt on the chances of a prolonged rally in prices.The cautious outlook comes after benchmark copper prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gain since 2011, largely fueled by Pres.-elect Trump's promises of infrastructure spending."In 2017, it will still be a relatively oversupplied market. In 2018 it will not be better than 2017," says a VP at Jiangxi Copper, China's largest copper producer; he also describes the market's recent moves as "irrational."The founder and president of Maike Metals Group, one of China's top metals traders, says China's government needs to control "overspeculation" in the local futures market, hit by volatile trading over the last week as it was whipsawed by speculative cash.Relevant tickers include FCX, BHP, RIO, VALE, OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY, OTC:ANFGF, OTCPK:AAUKF, OTCPK:AAUKY, JJC, CPER, CUPM.

Congo state miner opposes Lundin's Tenke mine stake sale
Congo state miner Gecamines says it strongly opposes Lundin Mining's (OTCPK:LUNMF) decision to sell a 24% stake in the Tenke copper mine, arguing it has a preemptive right to buy the stake.The decision came after Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), Tenke's majority owner, agreed in May to sell its 56% stake to China Molybdenum, a deal Gecamines also opposed because it wanted to buy the stake itself.Lundin CEO Paul Conibear says he hopes the sale will not be challenged by Gecamines.

Lundin Mining to sell stake in Tenke mine owner for $1.14B
Lundin Mining (OTCPK:LUNMF) agrees to sell its indirect stake in TF Holdings to an affiliate of China's BHR Partners for ~$1.14B, and will waive its rights to acquire Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) 70% stake in TF Holdings.TF Holdings owns an 80% interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining; Lundin owns an indirect 30% stake in TF, resulting in an effective 24% interest in Tenke.Through its stake in TF, FCX holds a 56% stake in the Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mine, which it agreed in May to sell to China Molybdenum for $2.65B.Tenke, in the southern Congolese copper belt, is one of the world's largest copper deposits.

Freeport McMoRan CEO says he will complete debt reduction plan
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.2%) CEO Richard Adkerson tells the Financial Times that he expects to stay with the company and complete a plan to cut its big debt load, and says FCX is now better positioned for an eventual recovery in copper prices after a series of asset sales.FCX's target is for net debt below $10B by the end of next year, and Adkerson says that “while we have a lot of work... we feel we proved our mettle this year."Even so, analysts say FCX's completion of at least one of two recent asset sales involving Anadarko Petroleum and China Molybdenum before year-end 2016 is crucial to avoiding problems with credit lines.“Freeport must close $3B of asset sales by December 31 in order to avoid tripping a... covenant," Morgan Stanley says. “While we think there is a strong possibility Tenke slips into 2017, we expect Gulf of Mexico to close despite bondholder litigation.” Nov. 14, 2016, 12:45 PM | 9 Comments
Copper on track for biggest weekly rally in 35 years
Copper was trading up 3% in late Asian trade, rising for a seventh straight session and up more than 15% for the week in what would be its biggest weekly gain since 1980, according to Reuters.Copper already had been moving higher by a surge in China steel and coal prices, but Trump's surprise election victory and comments in his acceptance speech on increased infrastructure spending fueled further buying.Traders say the pace of gains has been amplified by momentum-based fund buying, much of it from China, after prices this week smashed through a key chart resistance.Analysts also are revising down expectations of mine supply for 2017, after January's price slump to six-year lows forced some high-cost mines to shut, and with new supply from Peru largely complete.Relevant tickers include FCX, BHP, RIO, VALE, OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY, OTC:ANFGF, JJC, CPER, CUPM.

Freeport, copper continue to surge on hopes for U.S. construction boom
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +6.1%) extends this week's breakout momentum to challenge 18-month highs along the $14 level as copper prices continue to soar.High-grade copper futures for December have soared 4% so far today, the most in more than a year, extending gains as investors prepare for a possible boom in infrastructure projects under a Trump presidency.Along with improvement in economic data from China, a major buyer of industrial metals, “Trump’s pledge to spend, combined with a surge in speculative demand on exchanges from New York to London and Shanghai, have all helped drive copper up to a 16-months high,” says Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.Along for the ride are copper producers Antofagasta (OTC:ANFGF +11.3%), Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF +5.7%) and BHP Billiton (BHP +8.2%), as well as companies that may benefit from bulked-up spending on U.S. infrastructure projects, such as Dublin-based CRH (CRH +1%), which has surged 11% in two days as the U.S. market makes up 51% of its revenue.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Nov. 10, 2016, 10:45 AM | 19 Comments

Congo government appears to support Freeport sale of Tenke copper mine

Congo seeking arbitration over Freeport McMoRan mine sale
The Democratic Republic of Congo has turned to international arbitration in a bid to force Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and Lundin Mining (OTCPK:LUNMF) to restructure terms of any exit from one of the country’s biggest mines.State-owned mining company Gecamines has filed a complaint with the International Court of Arbitration in Paris, demanding that any change to the indirect ownership of the Tenke Fungurume mine be blocked unless authorized by the state miner.FCX plans to sell 56% of the copper and cobalt mine to China Molybdenum for $2.65B, and partner Lundin has a right of first offer on the sale; Gecamines, which owns 20% of the mine, objects to the sale because it was not informed in advance and that its rights to either pre-empt or participate in the deal had been overlooked.

Freeport McMoRan rated Underperform at BofA Merrill on weak copper outlook
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.1%) is resumed with an Underperform rating and $8 price target at BofA Merrill Lynch, which says balance sheet improvements are now priced in, and a sluggish copper outlook and risks related to Indonesia operations poise a real risk.BofA's global commodity team sees copper as the weakest in the base metals complex against a backdrop of sluggish global growth and large mines ramping up.After asset sales, FCX’s Americas and Indonesia mines become even more critical, and Indonesia challenges return to the forefront, specifically affected by export restrictions that could start in 2017 and an unclear future once FCX’s license expires in 2021.Deutsche Bank is more optimistic, retaining a Buy rating and $12.50 price target on valuation and expected corporate cost savings now that FCX has largely exited oil and gas following the $742M sale of its onshore California assets (Briefing.com).

Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.5%), Barrick Gold (ABX -2.5%) and Pan American Silver (PAAS -0.5%) are upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank, which notes the 12% Q3 rally in commodity prices have enabled the sector to improve their balance sheets via stock issuance, debt refinancing and asset disposals.The firm is neutral overall in the metals group, as it continues to believe that material supply cuts still are needed in most commodities and thus does not anticipate prices continuing their upward trend.Deutsche Bank says its top picks are ABX and Newmont Mining (NEM -3%) in precious metals, Steel Dynamics (STLD -2.4%) in steel, and Alcoa (AA -1.1%) and Kaiser Aluminum (KALU -1.8%) in aluminum; it upgrades AK Steel (AKS -0.7%), Coeur Mining (CDE -0.8%), Teck Resources (TCK -1.5%) and Goldcorp (GG -4.2%) to Hold from Sell.

Bloomberg: Freeport’s $2B asset sale to Anadarko hit with lender dissent
Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) bondholders may be objecting to the company's $2B sale of deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties to Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), Bloomberg reports.Some of the creditors holding $2.3B of bonds want more money and greater protection for allowing the asset sale, which requires changes to FCX’s existing agreement with the lenders, according to the report.FCX, which wants to keep the debt on its own balance sheet even as the assets shift to the buyer, is seeking majority approval from five sets of bondholders to complete the sale.The bondholders want a bigger consent fee, a higher interest rate on the debt and additional protective covenants to approve the sale, according to a creditor letter obtained by Bloomberg; without it, they want the debt to move with the assets to APC, which has a stronger credit profile than FCX.

Lundin gets bid extension on Freeport McMoRan Congo mine stake
Lundin Mining (OTCPK:LUNMF) says it has won another extension, until Sept. 29, to bid on Freeport McMoRan's (FCX +0.6%) stake in the Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Lundin, which already was granted an extension to Sept. 15, does not say why it needs more time but reiterates that it has credible interest from multiple parties on a number of scenarios.FCX agreed in May to sell its 56% stake in Tenke to China Molybdenum for $2.65B; Lundin owns a 24% stake but under a "right of first offer" can supplant any bids for the mine by matching them, or can decide to sell its stake, or do nothing and allow the China Moly deal to proceed.

Freeport McMoRan downgraded at Morgan Stanley on copper outlook
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -3.1%) is downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight with a $7 price target, cut from $9, at Morgan Stanley, which says the risk/reward balance now is skewed to the downside as the stock is now pricing in $2.75/lb copper, above the firm's expected $2.43 average over the next three years.“Copper would need to rise closer to the $3/lb mark for the company to be able to continue to both de-lever and pursue necessary mine extension capex at Grasberg," Stanley's Evan Kurtz writes.FCX is in negotiations with Indonesia's government for the sale of its 10.64% stake in the Grasberg copper asset, for which FCX is seeking $1.7B while the government believes the stake is worth only $630M; Kurtz values the stake at $1.25B, near the midpoint of the current bid-ask.

On a day of widespread carnage among oil and gas shares, Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) fell a mere 0.3% while Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) sank 8.4% in today's trade after its $2B sale of Gulf of Mexico deepwater exploration assets to APC.Morgan Stanley maintains its Overweight rating on APC and hikes its price target to $81 from $74, highlighting the deal's asset quality, upside potential from growing operated infrastructure, and the inexpensive valuation paid that supports long-term guidance of 10%-12% oil production compound annual growth rate to 2020.Johnson Rice upgrades APC to Buy, seeing the deal as "a contrarian move that captures a large chunk of value,” with near-term cash flow generated by the acquisition and the equity offering delevering the company.UBS says the deal should help APC grow oil volumes at better than 10%/year vs. prior investor concerns of little or no oil growth, and the combination of equity and free cash flow reduces net debt/EBITDX to 2.6x from 3.2x, which should offset any concern about increased exposure to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which climbs to 19% of overall production from 10%.

Freeport McMoRan -9% as analysts call asset sale "cheap"
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX -8.8%) is sharply lower after its $2B sale of Gulf of Mexico deepwater exploration assets to Anadarko Petroleum (APC -0.5%) is called "cheap" by some analysts.Deutsche Bank maintains its Hold rating on FCX but says it had valued the related properties at $2.9B, and that while the deal will help repair FCX's balance sheet and simplify the business to focus on copper, it is also "reducing portfolio optionality."Cowen analysts are more upbeat, seeing 50% upside to their $15 price target on FCX, saying “investors were skeptical a Gulf of Mexico deal could get done and view this transaction as the long-awaited closure of a major overhang for FCX shares."The sale wins the approval of Carl Icahn, who owns a 7.8% stake in FCX and has two representatives on the board, saying the sale shows that the company "is making good on its stated goal of deleveraging and is on track to cut its net debt by half, from year-end 2015 through the end of next year, at current copper prices."

Anadarko to buy Freeport's deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets for $2B
Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) -4.4% AH after agreeing to acquire Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets for $2B; FCX +2.4% AH.APC says the deal doubles its ownership in the Gulf of Mexico's Lucius development to 49%, adds ~80K net boe/day to its portfolio, expands its operated infrastructure throughout the Gulf of Mexico, and would generate an estimated $3B of incremental Gulf-related free cash flow over the next five years at current strip prices.APC also says it expects to raise its 2016 full-year capital guidance, not including the acquisition, to $2.8-$3B, primarily reflecting increased activity in the Delaware and DJ basins.FCX, which withdrew a plan to take its oil and gas operations public in May, says the deal brings its total 2016 asset sale transactions to more than $6B.To help fund the deal, APC says it plans a public offering of 35.25M common shares, with an underwriters option to purchase up to 5.287M additional shares.

Indonesia evaluates mining rules as deadline approaches on metal exports
Indonesia's mining ministry is scrambling to find a way around a deadline on mineral processing that could prevent some miners, including Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), from exporting minerals from the country beginning at the start of next year, Reuters reports.Uncertainty over Indonesia's mining rules have been a flashpoint between miners and the government for years, and the sector accounted for nearly 6% of Indonesia's GDP before a 2014 ban on metal ore exports but has slipped to ~4%.The export curbs - which have cost Indonesia billions of dollars in lost revenue - were intended to shift sales from unprocessed raw materials to higher-value finished metals, but smelters have been slow to materialize as low commodity prices have made them economically unviable.

Indonesia's mines ministry has issued a letter of recommendation for Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX) to obtain a permit to export 1.4M metric tons of copper concentrates until Jan. 11 next year, according to a ministry official.FCX, whose Indonesian copper export permit expired yesterday, still cannot export its concentrates until the trade ministry issues an export permit based on the mines ministry's recommendation.FCX, which usually produces ~220K metric tons/day of copper ore, could face a halt in shipments from its giant Grasberg copper mine if the government does not quickly approve an extension.

New Indonesia resources chief tells Freeport not to push on contract extension
Indonesia's new natural resources chief says Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.5%) should not push for a quick extension of its contract to operate the giant Grasberg copper mine."We are a sovereign state and we know what we are doing," the new minister says, referring to contract talks to extend FCX's right to mine in Indonesia beyond 2021.FCX is seeking assurances on a contract extension before investing $18B to expand its operations, but under existing laws cannot legally begin talks on a contract extension until 2019; however, the existing mining law is expected to be revised by parliament this year.

Noble Corp. posts sharp Q2 earnings miss, cuts capex
Noble Corp. (NYSE:NE) -0.5% AH after missing Q2 earnings estimates and lowering its full-year capital spending outlook.NE says Q2 contract drilling services revenues totaled $877M, helped immensely by a $379M gain from a settlement with Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), which canceled a contract during the quarter; without the settlement, contract drilling services revenues were $484M, down 18% from $591M in Q1, driven by a reduction in fleet operating days, with fleet utilization declining to 65% vs. 79% in Q1.NE's average dayrate for Q2 was $509,145; excluding the FCX settlement, NE earned only $280,884 per rig, down from ~$287K in Q1 and ~$340K in the year-ago quarter.NE also cuts its full-year capex estimate to $675M from $800M, saying "industry conditions remain challenging."

FBR raises price targets on Stillwater, Newmont Mining, Freeport McMoRan
Stillwater Mining (SWC -0.1%) is well positioned heading into Q2 earnings, FBR Capital says, as conservative expectations could be lifted on continued cost improvements as well as positive progress reports on Blitz and the company's non-operating assets, which often are overlooked; the firm lifts its price target on SWC's Buy-rated shares to $17 from $13.FBR expects Newmont Mining (NEM -4.7%) to report an in-line quarter vs. consensus, and raises its price target price to $39 from $31, believing the shares are fairly valued at current levels on expectations of steady gold prices from current levels and the company’s forward outlook.The firm foresees a modest Q2 beat for Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.2%) but is cautious, citing increased concerns about the pace of progress in the negotiations with the Indonesian government; FBR raises its price target to $11 from $9.Teck Resources (TCK -1.4%) has pulled back from its recent strong stock performance, and FBR thinks the company needs to post strong results to regain its momentum.The firm rates NEM, FCX and TCK at Market Perform.

Fire at Enterprise Products gas plant halts two U.S. Gulf Coast platforms
The Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) natural gas processing plant in Pascagoula, Miss., remains closed after today's fire, which is now under control but forced the closure of the 225-mile Destin gas pipeline system that can carry 1.2B cf/day from offshore fields to Pascagoula.Destin, majority-owned by BP with Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) a minority partner, declares force majeure as a result of the fire.Murphy Oil (NYSE:MUR) says it shut its Thunder Hawk platform, which also is connected to the Destin system and has the capacity to handle 60K bbl/day of oil and 70M cf/day of natural gas.LLOG, partially owned by the Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), says it is shutting its Delta House floating production system, which has 100K bbl/day of oil and 240m cf/day of gas capacity.Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ) says the Gulfstream Pipeline, a joint venture with Spectra Energy Partners (NYSE:SEP), appears to be unaffected.BP, whose Thunder Horse and Na Kika platforms tie into the Destin pipeline and together produce nearly 400K bbl/day of oil and more than 700M cf/day of natural gas, has not commented; the status of other Gulf producers which operate facilities that connect to Destin, including Stone Energy (NYSE:SGY) and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), is not known.

Oil companies cranking up 500K bbl/day in new Gulf of Mexico production
The U.S. currently pumps ~8.7M bbl/day of crude oil, 480K less than at the end of 2015, but more than 500K bbl/day of new crude from the Gulf of Mexico is set to come online this year and next, WSJ reports, threatening to prolong the oil glut and hold down prices.One reason is a handful of massive oil fields sanctioned for development years ago by companies such as BP and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) that will start pumping later this year, but another is that companies have found that smaller satellite fields can be tapped inexpensively by tieback wells linked to existing offshore oil platforms via underwater pipelines.Exxon (NYSE:XOM) this year began pumping from the tieback Julia offshore well, with production piped back to a Chevron (NYSE:CVX) platform; CVX also recently executed a tieback that will produce 50% more oil and gas than it originally expected.Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL) nearly doubled its Gulf output in Q1 and has another well starting to pump later this summer; Anadarko (NYSE:APC) has more than 30 tieback well prospects in satellite fields, and will drill up to seven this year.Companies also are getting better at accessing deepwater finds; Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) saved $1B drilling its Stones project, which will start up later this year, by using a slim-well design offshore engineers borrowed from onshore shale operations.

We need to see the proof in actions, not just in verbiage."Wall Street mostly ignored the agreement, with stocks in related sectors showing a mixed bag in today's trade: AA +2.3%, AKS +1.3%, NUE +0.4%, STLD +0.3%, X -0.8%, FCX -0.8%.Now read AK Steel, U.S. Steel downgraded to Sell at UBS Apr. 14, 2016, 5:32 PM | 16 Comments

Report: Natural decline to outstrip new output in 2017 as oil cost cuts work
For the first time in years, drillers are expected to add less oil from new fields in 2016 than they lose to natural decline in old ones, according to an analysis by Rystad Energy.New projects expected to generate ~3M bbl/day will come from new projects this year compared with 3.3M bbl/day lost from established fields, but the decline will outstrip new output by 1.2M bbl/day in 2017 as investment cuts made during the oil rout start to take effect on the way to a "very strong effect" by 2020, Rystad says.In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico this year, Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) is scheduled to start the Stones project, with projects run by Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL) and Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX) also due to begin; Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) started the Heidelberg field in January.Eni (NYSE:E) commenced the Goliat field in the Arctic this month, Shell started producing from a new area of the BC-10 project in Brazil earlier this month, and Tullow Oil (OTCPK:TUWLF, OTCPK:TUWOY) plans to begin output from the TEN field offshore Ghana this summer.Morgan Stanley estimates nine projects are in contention to get a green light this year, including BP’s Mad Dog Phase 2 in the Gulf of Mexico and Eni’s Zohr gas field in Egypt, yet Rystad believes these developments will not be enough to counter the natural decline in oil fields that are starting to suffer from lower investment.ETFs: USO, OIL, UCO, UWTI, SCO, BNO, DWTI, DBO, DTO, USL, DNO, OLO, SZO, OLEM Mar. 22, 2016, 6:06 PM | 25 Comments

Copper cuts not enough to end surplus in 2016, Freeport exec says
Copper production cuts will not be enough to end a surplus this year and demand will not catch up with supply until 2017, Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1%) senior VP of marketing and sales Javier Targhetta tells Bloomberg.~700K metric tons of supply will have been removed in the year through mid-2016, but new supplies from mines added this year mean a glut will not be completely wiped out in 2016, Targhetta says.Copper prices have tumbled in the past three years amid slowing economic growth in China, the metal's biggest consumer; meanwhile, production outpaced demand by ~147K tons in 2015, the biggest surplus since 2009."Long term I am very positive," Targhetta says.

Vale (VALE +18.3%) and U.S. Steel (X +15.3%) are pacing the biggest weekly rally since 2008 for stocks of mining and metals companies, Bloomberg says as its index of 47 metals, mining and steel producers has racked up a 20% gain this week.Vale has rallied nearly 80% this week, as iron ore prices extended a rebound and Brazilian stocks jumped as the latest developments in the federal investigation of vast corruption threaten to topple the Rousseff government.Copper suppliers Freeport McMoRan (FCX +12.4%), Teck Resources (TCK +10.3%) and First Quantum Minerals (OTCPK:FQVLF +11.4%) also are among the top gainers, as copper prices climb to their highest in four months on speculation that China will announce more steps to boost growth.Anglo American (OTCPK:AAUKF, OTCPK:AAUKY) also heads for its seventh straight gain, the stock's longest winning run in two years.

Freeport cut to Sell at Citi, as planned asset sales likely to erode NAV
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -5.3%) is downgraded to Sell from Neutral with a $4.50 price target at Citigroup, which says mining assets which are near bottom of their respective commodity cycle may deteriorate the company's net asset value, adding uncertainty into debt funding in 2018.Citi's Brian Yu says his mine-by-mine analysis shows FCX’s various assets could be worth close to $10/share based on a longer-term view of copper and oil markets, but while FCX would need to make the divestitures to preserve liquidity and fund significant debt maturing in 2018, the planned sales of mining assets towards the trough of the commodity cycle could erode NAV value.FCX has more than doubled since mid-January.

Copper surges, boosting Freeport McMoRan
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +12.1%) soars ~12% in early trade to lead the S&P 500, as copper futures and other base metals surge.The LME’s three-month copper contract was up 1.4% at $4,686/metric ton after hitting a two-week high earlier in the session at $4,701, maintaining its price momentum after closing above $4,600/ton last week for the first time in almost two weeks.Positive trading sentiment on copper was upheld by China’s announcement that it will reduce deed and business taxes for home buyers in a bid to speed up home sales and reduce the glut on the property market; weak Chinese property sales have been bad for copper prices, as the sector accounts for most of the demand for the metal.Meanwhile, Bloomberg's David Fickling thinks BHP Billiton (BHP +5.9%) ought to buy FCX: BHP's copper output would more than double overnight and control of all three of the world's biggest copper pits - Escondida, Grasberg and Morenci - while a deal also would make sense for FCX, "whose debts are dragging it dangerously close to the plughole."ETFs: JJC, DBB, CPER, BOM, RJZ, BOS, JJM, BDD, CUPM Feb. 22, 2016, 10:33 AM | 22 Comments

Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is granted a new six-month export permit by Indonesia's government, ending a nearly two-week stoppage due to a dispute over payment for a new metal smelter.FCX halted shipments from its Grasberg mine last month after the government demanded the company first pay a $530M deposit for a smelter before it renewed the permit.Copper futures fell sharply yesterday after Indonesia's mining industry recommended the resumption of shipments, and are continuing lower, partly on oversupply concerns exacerbated by the decision on Grasberg exports.FCX +2.6% premarket.

Rally in mining stocks could set up "bull trap," some analysts say
Mining stocks hit hard in 2015 are the darlings of the new year, as the drag on the dollar due to fresh jitters about the strength of the U.S. economy has helped power the group higher.The dollar’s weakness has helped fuel the recent bounce in commodities: Iron ore, which sank 40% in 2015, has gained 14% since mid-January, while copper prices, which hit their lowest levels since early 2009 in mid-January, are up 10%.A glimmer of hope about China and global growth could signal a bottom for commodities and mining stocks, Bernstein's Paul Gait says, but other analysts caution that the rally could be a “bull trap" - a brief bounce before another dive into the red.Relevant tickers: FCX, OTCPK:AAUKF, OTCPK:AAUKY, OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY, BHP, RIO, VALE Feb. 5, 2016, 12:58 PM | 24 Comments

Freeport -9% as more losses loom; Indonesia wants $530M more for smelter
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -9.2%) suffered a violent reversal on heavy volume earlier today, now down ~9% after gaining 8% at the open, as the company prepares to report what analysts predict will be its fifth straight quarterly loss.The continued drop in copper and oil prices increases the likelihood that FCX will need to resort to additional capex cuts or asset sales, BB&T analysts say.Reuters reported earlier that Indonesia's government has ordered FCX to set aside an additional $530M to extend its permit to export copper concentrate; the amount would add to an estimated $80M the company set aside in July to obtain its current export permit, which is set to expire on Jan. 29.FCX is "getting hit by everything,” says Macquarie mining analyst Anthony Young. “It’s the fall in copper prices and metals, the plunge in oil and natural gas, and the amount of debt on the balance sheet. It’s going to take some pretty dramatic steps by management to right this ship."FCX shares have now shed 41% YTD and are sharply lower even on a day that most other miners and commodity producers are enjoying strong gains.

Global miners suffer worst losses since 2011
Shares in global mining companies face their biggest back-to-back weekly losses in four years after signs of slowing growth in China, plunging oil prices and asset writedowns at BHP Billiton spark a selloff.Copper prices hit a six-year low for the fifth time in a week in London, -1.9%, amid worries about China’s economy, and are now down nearly 9% YTD; aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc all fell more than 1%.Long-dated “copper prices adjusted for producer country FX are mostly unchanged, which underscores the macro nature of the recent declines,” according to Goldman Sachs."No lasting price recovery appears possible at present, neither on the metal markets nor on the commodities markets in general," Commerzbank says.BHP -7.7%, RIO -6.4%, OTCPK:AAUKF -5.7%, VALE -5.5%, FCX -5.4%, OTCPK:GLCNF -4.4%, TCK -4.3%, SCCO -1.1%.ETFs: JJC, DBB, JJN, JJU, CPER, JJT, BOM, RJZ, BOS, FOIL, JJM, LD, BDD, NINI, CUPM, LEDD Jan. 15, 2016, 10:34 AM | 34 Comments

Freeport McMoRan down another 10%, now -43% YTD
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -10.3%) suffers another beating today, down more than 10% and extending losses to 43% for the year, after Jefferies downgrades shares to Hold from Buy with a $5 price target, slashed from $17.Jefferies says the downgrade reflects lower copper price forecasts, a higher risk in Indonesia and FCX's "reluctance" to sell assets, and adds that it is "concerned that the window of opportunity for FCX to repair its balance sheet may have closed."The firm laments that it had anticipated FCX would pursue sales of large copper assets that would have "unlocked significant value as Freeport traded at a large discount to its sum-of-the-parts value."

BHP, Rio Tinto likely to cut dividends, HSBC says
BHP Billiton (BHP -4.3%) could cut is payout in half when it releases results, and Rio Tinto (RIO -4.5%) also could cut its dividend later this year, HSBC analysts say, citing the need for the miners to cut expenses to help indebted balance sheets and offset weak commodities prices.HSBC also says Anglo American (OTCPK:AAUKF, OTCPK:AAUKY) and First Quantum Minerals (OTCPK:FQVLF) are most at risk if commodities remain weak, although continued South African rand weakness would help Anglo, while strength in copper and other stock-specific reasons could favor returns for Freeport McMoRan (FCX -13.4%) and Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY).The firm downgrades BHP and First Quantum to Reduce, maintains a Reduce rating on Anglo, and has a Buy rating on FCX and Glencore.

BHP Billiton hits decade low as copper drops to cheapest since 2009
BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) shares sink to decade lows on the Australian Stock Exchange as copper prices plummet to their lowest in six years, after muted Chinese inflation and more equity losses in Shanghai increase concern that demand from the country will slow."China gobbles up about one-half of global demand for anything from aluminum to copper, zinc, tin or coal," says an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. "More downward pressure on the price of commodities and on commodity firms’ valuations can be expected.”Metals have lost most of the modest gains they made toward the end of last year, with the LME Index falling last week by the the most since May.Related tickers: RIO, VALE, FCX, JJC, CPER, CUPM Jan. 11, 2016, 8:59 AM | 15 Comments
Freeport McMoran, Cliffs Natural downgraded at Macquarie
Macquarie downgrades Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1%)and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF -5.5%) to Neutral from Outperform with respective price targets of $7.30, lowered from $18, and $1.60, slashed from $6, while upgrading Alcoa (AA -2.6%) to Outperform from Neutral with a $13 price target, raised from $11.The firm likes FCX's four world class copper assets - Cerro Verde in Peru, Grasberg in Indonesia, Morenci in Arizona, and Tenke Fungurume in Congo - but believes a Neutral rating is warranted given the current macro backdrop.On CLF, “shutting projects, curtailing production, focusing on the United States and paying down debt... have likely saved the company. Unfortunately, the domestic steel market remains weak, driven by lackluster demand."The firm says it is not throwing in the towel at the bottom of the commodities cycle but does not believe a sustainable recovery in commodities is probable.

Reuters: Freeport McMoRan soon may auction off oil and gas assets
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) plans to run an auction process for its oil and gas assets in early 2016, in what would be its first concrete move to end its ill-fated move into oil and gas after it said in October it would explore strategic options for the assets, Reuters reports.FCX reportedly has retained Lazard to advise on possible sale of its entire oil and gas interests, which could be worth more than $3B, according to the report.FCX's energy division includes assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, onshore and offshore assets in California, and in the Haynesville natural gas shale formation as well as other natural gas assets in Louisiana.Shedding the oil and gas business would leave FCX with substantial copper and gold mining assets, as ~60% of the company's $21B of revenue in 2014 came from copper, with ~20% from oil.FCX soared 16% in regular trading amid today's rally in commodities.

Freeport capex cuts could impact Noble Corp., Rowan, analyst says

(NYSE:NE) and perhaps Rowan (NYSE:RDC) at risk.While FCX says it is ongoing discussions with its rig vendors and other service providers to obtain cost reductions, West believes the two higher priced NE drillships could be at risk while the company continues to operate the lower priced Rowan Relentless.FCX's most recently approved permits are for work with the Rowan Relentless, and West thinks RDC could successfully negotiate blend and extend contracts for this and at least one of its three other drillships rolling off contract in 2017-18.

Freeport McMoRan suspends dividend, slashes spending plans
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) says it is suspending its dividend of $0.20/share and further reducing its capital spending plans for 2016-17.FCX says it is cutting oil and gas capex to $1.8B for 2016 and $1.2B 2017 from $2B/year in 2016 and 2017.Following its previously announced 25% cut in 2016 capital spending for its mining business, FCX says it will fully shut down of its Sierrita mine in Arizona and adjust operating plans from its primary molybdenum mines, which will increase curtailments to 350M lbs./year of copper and 34M lbs./year of molybdenum.Assuming prices of $2/lb. for copper and $45/bbl for Brent crude oil during 2016, FCX estimates consolidated operating cash flow would exceed capex by more than $600M.FCX says the dividend cut will enhance liquidity by saving ~$240M/year.FCX -0.2% premarket.

Freeport Indonesia head says speaker of parliament tried to extort shares
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is at the center of a major political scandal in Indonesia after confirming that the speaker of the country's parliament tried to extort shares from the company to ensure a contract extension.The head of FCX's Indonesian operations has told the parliament's ethics panel he secretly recorded a meeting in which the speaker asked for a 20% stake in the unit, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.FCX had asked for an extension of its contract to give it legal certainty before investing billions of dollars in an underground phase at its Grasberg gold and copper sites; FCX generated 8.4% of its revenue last year from Indonesia.

FT: Freeport McMoRan suffers license setback in Indonesia
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.8%) suffers a setback after a top Indonesian minister says the government will not take a quick decision on whether to extend the company’s operating license at the Grasberg copper and gold mine, FT reports.FCX’s Indonesian unit has been seeking reassurance that its permit for the mine would be renewed beyond the current 2021 expiration date, even though local regulations say negotiations can only begin two years before the contract ends."We don’t want to extend this contract until 2019,” the minister says, according to FT. “Why should we give them an extension today when we have to break our own regulation?”The comments appear to mark a sharp change in the government’s stance, as FCX believed it had received assurances that its Grasberg operations would be extended beyond 2021 (I, II).

U.S. regulator tells Plains All American to purge California oil pipeline
U.S. pipeline regulators order Plains All American Pipeline (PAA, PAGP) to shut down and clean out a California crude oil pipeline system to prevent corrosion after a separate but nearby pipeline ruptured and fouled Santa Barbara beaches last May.The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration says Plains must purge oil from Line 903, a 130-mile pipeline that runs from Gaviota, Calif., inland to Kern County, as well as three shut offshore oil pipelines operated by Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) that normally feed Line 903.The agency says surveys have shown that Line 903 has "similar corrosion characteristics" as Line 901, which ruptured and spilled more than 100K gallons of crude onto beaches and into the ocean last May.Line 901 has been shut and empty since the spill, with the damaged section removed shortly thereafter; Line 903 also is shut but PHMSA says it has been "full of crude oil" since May except for a small section.

Copper sinks to six-year low on slumping Chinese demand
Copper prices plunged to a six-year low today, dragging down mining company shares, after China's import data showed declining demand from the world's top buyer of the industrial metal.China's imports of copper and copper products for the first 10 months of 2015 fell 4.2% Y/Y to 3.82M tons, the government said today; China accounts for ~40% of global copper demand, and the import data highlights long-running concerns that the country's economic slowdown would translate into lower copper imports.The fall in copper prices rattled the mining sector, which has been battered by a prolonged slump in metals prices; Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY), which got 20% of its operating income from copper production in H1 of 2015, fell 5.3% in London, and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) ended 2.3% lower.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Nov. 9, 2015, 6:17 PM | 4 Comments
Bloomberg: "$6.5B in energy writedowns and we're just getting started"
Southwestern Energy's (SWN -6.6%) $2.8B impairment and Freeport McMoRan's (FCX -0.5%) $3.7B charge are just the beginning, as Barclays estimates at least $20B in charges are coming during Q3 for just six companies, as reported by Bloomberg.SWN’s $2.8B writedown was double Barclays’ forecast, which also predicts ceiling-test impairments for Apache (APA -0.1%), Chesapeake Energy (CHK -2.3%), Devon Energy (DVN -0.1%), Encana (ECA -2%) and Newfield Exploration (NFX +0.1%)."Many companies will have writedowns as the price of oil is about half of where it once was and gas is also down,” says T. Rowe Price's Timothy Parker, but "it won’t generally hurt the companies because very few have debt covenants that are linked to book value, which the writedowns affect."

Freeport McMoRan heads lower after Q3 loss, more production cuts
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) -1.6% premarket after reporting a wider than expected Q3 loss and a 35% Y/Y drop in revenues to $3.68B.FCX says it took total one-time charges of $3.7B in the quarter, including a $3.5B net charge tied to the company’s oil and gas division amid weak crude prices.FCX says it is cutting operating rates at its Sierrita mine in Arizona by 50% and considering a full shutdown; the pullback will cut ~100M lbs. of copper and 10M lbs. of molybdenum annually.Q3 copper sales fell to 1B lbs. from 1.1B in the same period last year; the average realized price for copper fell to $2.38/lb. from $3.12 a year ago.Q3 gold sales fell to 294K oz. from 525K oz.; the average price dropped to $1,117/oz. from $1,220/oz.Q3 oil sales rose to 13.8M barrels from 12.5M barrels; the average price  declined to $55.88/bbl from $88.58.The latest results may provide further ammunition for Carl Icahn, who said in August he intends to pressure the company to shrink operations with high-cost production.

Freeport to get ops extension "promptly" upon amendment, ministry says
Indonesia's energy ministry says a contract extension for Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) operations in the country will be given "promptly" once the government implements a planned mining regulatory amendment, which it aims to finalize by year's end, Reuters reports.The mines ministry dismisses earlier statements from two senior ministers who maintain that a contract extension will not be decided for at least another four years, saying they do not have the authority to decide on such matters.FCX seeks to renew its contract that would allow it to continue operating beyond 2021 at the Grasberg mine in Papua, one of the world's biggest deposits of gold and copper.Indonesian Pres. Widodo starts a five-day trip to the U.S. on Oct. 25, including a visit with FCX execs, and the battle over the contract extension threatens to mar his trip. Oct. 16, 2015, 8:26 AM | 6 Comments
Indonesia now demanding more royalties from Freeport for longer contract
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.2%) should substantially hike its royalty payments to Indonesia's government if it wants to extend a contract to operate the Grasberg mine, the country's chief natural resources minister says.FCX said last week it received assurances from a mining minister that its contract for the huge copper and gold mine would be extended beyond 2021, but new comments from the top minister throw into question the status of contract re-negotiations between the miner and the government.FCX agreed in July 2014 to start paying 4% in royalties on copper sales, up from 1.5%-3.5% previously, but the top minister is now telling parliament the company should pay 6%-7%.

Freeport McMoran +5% as it seeks return to roots
Investors send FreeportMcMoRan’s (FCX +4.8%) stock surging after the company said it is considering new alternatives for its oil and gas business and that it is slimming down its board to nine members from 16.Analysts such as Cowen's Anthony Rizzuto praise the strategic move to refocus on the copper business as "a much needed step in the right direction,” but Citigroup's Brian Yu maintains a Neutral rating, saying that if FCX successfully spins off the oil and gas business it would help the company’s future free cash flow but would not help the overall debt burden.The timing of FCX’s strategic review could indicate the company and its board may use it to fend off Carl Icahn if he were to run a proxy context, but it is not clear whether investors will see the moves, combined with a recently announced cost cutting effort, as sufficient action to fix FCX’s woes.

Copper prices surge on supply disruptions in Chile, Peru
Copper prices surge as mine disruptions in Latin America and optimism for demand from China bring buyers into the market.In Chile, output at the world’s biggest copper mine, Collahuasi, was cut by 30K metric tons/year due to low prices; the mine, owned by Anglo American (OTCPK:AAUKF, OTCPK:AAUKY) and Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY), accounted for 6% of global production in 2014.Meanwhile, Peru declared a state of emergency in the area around the Las Bambas mine after clashes between police and protesters left three people dead.But while copper prices tend to rally “any time you hear about disruptions to supply out of a country like Chile, the threat has been very short lived," says a commodities broker with RJO Futures, adding that concerns about the health of the global economy continue to keep a lid on the copper market.Relevant tickers: FCX, JJC, CPER, CUPM Sep. 30, 2015, 11:48 AM | 3 Comments

Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) shares were not helped by today's news that it had found more oil at one of its Gulf of Mexico properties, which the company believes could eventually pump 30K boe/day from its deepwater facilities there.FCX says it expects to start bringing up oil and gas from three development wells it drilled at its Horn Mountain Deep field by H1 2017.FCX began drilling at three production platforms in the deep Gulf last year and so far has drilled a dozen wells, three of which are producing oil and gas; the company expects the rest to come online over the next two years.Earlier: Glencore leads broad selloff in commodities firms, miners, even banks Sep. 28, 2015, 5:20 PM | 13 Comments
Glencore leads broad selloff in commodities firms, miners, even banks
It isn't just Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY) who is tanking, as at least one measure of raw materials producers plunges to seven-year lows following the company's woes and data that showed weakening Chinese industrial profits.Shares of Glencore plunged 29% to close at just 69 pence, an all-time low, exaggerated by a damning report that said future earnings are so uncertain that the company may need to direct all of its efforts to repay debt.Freeport McMoRan (FCX -10.2%) is hit hard after breaking below support at $10/share, and global mining peers Rio Tinto (RIO -4.1%), BHP Billiton (BHP -4.5%) and Vale (VALE -9.4%) also are smacked down.A number of other firms also are in situations not that much different from Glencore, says DTN analyst Darin Newsom, noting that Caterpillar (CAT -2.2%) and Deere (DE -1.6%) have been struggling and adding that pressure on Glencore may “create a vacuum those other struggling companies could get sucked into."Along with oil and gas producers and precious metals miners, even financial stocks are affected, with Morgan Stanley (MS -3.6%) and Goldman Sachs (GS -3.4%) underperforming their banking peers, perhaps as investors grow nervous about the potential for any of Glencore's problems possibly blowing back on other commodity trading operations.

Mining shares are leading a big slide in European equities as metals prices tumble on fears that an economic slowdown in China, the world’s biggest consumer of raw materials, is deepening.Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY) fell to a new intraday low of 107 pence/share, down more than 9% for the worst performance on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index; Anglo American (OTCPK:AAUKF, OTCPK:AAUKY), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) and Antofagasta (OTC:ANFGF) each fall more than 6%, while BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) rank among the 10 biggest decliners, down ~4.3% each.Credit Suisse cuts its earnings estimates across the mining sector, saying “Until China demand and emerging market currencies find a floor, it will remain challenging to put an absolute floor on commodity prices."The firm cuts its stock price targets for diversified miners including BHP, which also says it is planning to sell hybrid securities to help refinance near-term liabilities.Moody's says miners likely will be the hardest hit of any sector in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as a result of China’s economic slowdown.Also: FCX -4.5%, VALE -4.1%, X -2.8%, AA -1.7% premarket.

Pockets of value persist in metals and mining, FBR analysts say
Metal and mining stocks have been hit hard in recent months, but analysts at FBR Capital argue that there are still attractive names to own in the sector.Companies with exposure to the zinc and met coal markets look appealing, FBR says, as supply reductions could act as a positive catalyst for prices; Teck Resources (NYSE:TCK) is the firm's top pick there, with Horsehead Holding (NASDAQ:ZINC) the favorite small-cap idea.The firm sees "no structural turnaround for domestic thermal coal," but thinks the rate of decline will begin to slow next year, justifying Outperform ratings on Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP) and Westmoreland Coal (NASDAQ:WLB); Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD) and Joy Global (NYSE:JOY) are rated Underperform.FBR is fairly upbeat on steel names, initiating SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SXC) and SunCoke Partners (NYSE:SXCP) at Outperform, as SunCoke’s long-lived coke assets are able to generate strong margins “in almost any U.S. steel environment"; Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF) is rated Market Perform.The copper market will remain in surplus through 2017, FBR says, but it rates Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) at Outperform; Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is rated Market Perform.Among precious metals miners, the firm prefers Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) and Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD), the latter "a diversified company with a solid balance sheet and attractive acquisition opportunities."

Freeport chooses second share sale as least bad option amid commodities rout
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -12.2%) slumps to its lows of the day following news it may sell another $1B of its shares after just completing a similar $1B sale.Analysts see the plan as the lesser of three evils against "weak and uncertain market conditions," given FCX's ~$21B in total debt, with equity issuance less onerous than asset sales in a distressed environment or increasing leverage and losing its investment grade status.FCX also may face significant risks at its Indonesian copper and gold mine at Grasberg, which will require massive capital spending in coming years; FCX generated 8.4% of its 2014 revenues from Indonesia.As for Carl Icahn, who disclosed a ~8.5% stake in the company last month, "It’s not really clear what [he] can do,” BB&T analyst Garrett Nelson says. “He’ll probably try to get a couple of board seats, but the problems Freeport faces are structural and it mainly relates to their Indonesian exposure."

Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) -2.7% premarket after saying it completed its $1B at-the-market common stock offering and saying it has filed to sell an additional $1B in at-the-market stock.FCX says it plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt and financing of working capital and capex.FCX also says it is still talking to investors on investing in its oil and gas properties and the possible IPO of a minority stake in the business."The actions we have taken to cut costs, significantly reduce capital expenditures in our mining and oil and gas businesses and raise equity proceeds are necessary in the current period of weak and uncertain market conditions," FCX says.

J.P. Morgan lists 25 non-financial stocks at risk if Fed raises rates
J.P. Morgan analysts warn that companies with large amounts of floating-rate debt - including Chesapeake Energy, Freeport McMoRan, Ford and GE - could be at risk if the Fed decides to raise interest rates.Companies with variable/floating-rate debt suffer a more immediate impact by a rate hike than companies with fixed-rate debt, the analysts say; variable-rate coupons typically reset quarterly, meaning that changes in the base rate flow through almost immediately to variable-rate borrowers, while fixed-rate borrowers do not see such an impact until they refinance or issue new debt.JPM lists 25 companies - not including financials - that have the “highest variable-rate debt as a percentage of market cap": FMC, NRG, FCX, AES, CVC, LVLT, PVH, CHK, FE, DVA, THC, OI, CNX, F, HCA, FOSL, RCL, JOY, GE, ADS, ALLE, HBI, GT, DNB, AN

Citi optimistic about copper recovery, but Goldman stays bearish
Copper bulls hurt by slowing Chinese demand have reason for hope as Citigroup predicts mine disruptions will send the oversupplied market back into deficit next year.More than 1.5M metric tons of planned output this year has been lost for reasons ranging from rains and riots in Chile to lack of precipitation in Zambia and Papua New Guinea, Citigroup analysts say.Copper mine output this year will total 18.9M tons, with production exceeding demand by 61K tons, in 2015 and a deficit of 284K tons next year, with refined output estimated to rise 1.3%, or less than half the rate in 2015.Goldman Sachs, however, projects surpluses through 2019, including a  506K-ton surplus this year and 673K in 2016 amid supply growth and weak Chinese demand.Relevant tickers: FCX, OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY, JJC, CPER, CUPM Sep. 15, 2015, 5:57 PM | 10 Comments
Copper may be headed for a significant upside move, analyst says
It doesn't get as much attention as oil, but copper has quietly rallied 9% off recent lows and broken its downtrend; as an example of copper's strength, Freeport McMoRan (FCX +4.9%) is up 39% since its low close on Aug. 26.Copper futures are slightly above yesterday’s seven-week high, as weak China inflation data reinforced views that the government will roll out fresh support measures.Copper could be in the midst of a significant upside reversal that is destined to test the upper channel boundary, after traversed from the top of its downward-sloping channel to the bottom before bouncing, MarketWatch's Mike Paulenoff writes.Copper has been lifted this week amid news of global production cuts, including Glencore's suspension of operations at two copper mines in a bid to lower operating costs.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Sep. 10, 2015, 2:32 PM | 10 Comments
Freeport Indonesia cuts copper sales forecast due to El Nino
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +3.1%) lowers guidance for 2015 copper concentrate sales from its Indonesian unit by 3% after milling operations were hurt by the El Nino dry weather pattern.FCX, which runs one of the world's largest copper mines in Papua in eastern Indonesia, says a lack of water supply will cut 2015 sales by 25M lbs. from an earlier sales estimate of 860M lbs.Exports from the Grasberg mine complex already have been slowed this quarter by new payment rules for buyers and the closure of FCX's domestic smelter.

Metals move higher following plans for output cuts
Industrial metals continue their recent climb, with aluminum, zinc and lead trying to play catch-up with copper, which has gained 5% this week as more miners mothball operations at loss-making mines.Glencore's (OTCPK:GLNCY, OTCPK:GLCNF) Monday announcement that it will cut 400K metric tons of copper production over the next 18 months at two mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia comes in the wake of closures or cutbacks at mines controlled by Freeport McMoRan (FCX +4.3%) and others; shortly after Glencore’s decision, the Chinese operator of the Baluba mine in Zambia said it was suspending operations and cutting jobs.The closures follow a high level of production outages across the copper industry this year because of bad weather and labor disputes, with the combined effect helping to tighten the difference between supply and demand.ETFs: JJC, DBB, JJN, JJU, CPER, JJT, BOM, RJZ, BOS, FOIL, JJM, LD, BDD, NINI, CUPM, LEDD Sep. 9, 2015, 11:19 AM | 9 Comments

S&P cuts Freeport McMoRan outlook to negative on lower copper assumptions
Freeport McMoRan's (FCX -4.9%) outlook is reduced to negative from stable at Standard & Poor's as the ratings agency lowers its copper price assumptions through 2017 by 11% to $2.40/lb.; FCX's BBB- corporate credit rating is maintained.As a result, S&P expects FCX'ss 2015 adjusted debt leverage will exceed the 4.5x downside rating trigger previously established for the rating.The negative outlook reflects ongoing uncertainty with regard to copper prices and the possibility that FCX might not be able to meet its cost-cutting and copper production expansion targets by the end of 2016.Also: Copper hit hardest by jobs report Sep. 4, 2015, 11:13 AM | 11 Comments
Freeport McMoRan downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -7.4%) is downgraded to Neutral from Buy with an $12 price target, lowered from $20, at Citigroup, which says the copper sector has not reduced production enough to account for falling prices.FCX has guided to strong cash flow of $6.3B for 2016, at $2.25/lb. copper and $54/bbl oil, but the guidance included considerable working capital drawdown, which Citi estimates at $1.8B while saying there is "very little incremental deleveraging opportunity."According to the Citi report, the best opportunity for FCX to improve its free cash flow is to eliminate or at least reduce its exposure to oil and gas.Global miners are having a rough time as weak China data batters stocks: BHP -6.7%, RIO -5.3%, VALE -3.5%, TCK -7.6%.

Union considers action after 700 workers fired at Freeport mine in Chile
A Chilean union representing copper mine workers rejects a move to drastically cut staff at Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) 51%-owned El Abra mine and says it is considering action after 700 workers had their jobs terminated over the weekend.FCX announced last week it was slashing production in the wake of slumping copper prices, which would include reducing mining rates at El Abra by about half to reduce and defer costs and extend the mine's life.El Abra produced ~160K metric tons of refined copper last year out of Chile's total 5.7M, placing it just outside the top 10 biggest mines in Chile, which produces a third of the world's copper.

Investors hoping Icahn can bring sale of energy assets
Carl Icahn, who revealed an 8.5% stake in downtrodden Freeport McMoRan (FCX +2.7%) late yesterday, is "one of the best instinct investors of all time and often invests at the right point in a cycle,” according to 13D Monitor, and investors appear to agree, sending shares higher and capping a two-day 32% spike."If Icahn wants a board seat, the question is not whether he will get one or not, but how quickly he will get one. When stocks get beaten up like this, it is very easy for an activist to implement its agenda,” 13D Monitor says, noting that Icahn got on the Cheniere Energy board less than three weeks after announcing his active stake.Citigroup’s Brian Yu sees potential value creation from divesting the oil and gas business under the right circumstances and deleveraging the balance sheet, effectively undoing the 2013 acquisitions of Plains Exploration & Production and McMoRan Exploration.S&P Capital IQ’s Matthew Miller raises his rating on the stock to Hold from Sell which a $12 target price, up from $10, citing Icahn’s stake as well as lower operating and capital costs.While the latest round of cost-cutting actions illustrate FCX's ability to manage an increasingly challenging price environment, Deutsche Bank thinks a primary equity raise and/or some monetization of E&P assets are still needed to truly strengthen the balance sheet.

Freeport McMoRan +25% on cutbacks; Jefferies says shares worth $14
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +25.4%) surges as much as 30%, an intraday record for the company, after announcing plans to cut spending and production, and lowering its 2016 capex budget by 29% from its $5.6B estimate issued in July.FCX now expects its 2016 copper production to come in ~150M lbs. lower than estimated, seeing 5.25B lbs. in copper sales compared with 5.4B lbs. previously, mainly because of reduced activity at several mines in the Americas; mining will be suspended at its facility in Arizona, while output will be cut in half Tyrone in New Mexico and El Abra in Chile.FCX shares are worth at least $14 on sum-of-the-parts valuations, using "very conservative” assumptions, Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina writes, adding that FCX could still sell assets such as its Cerro Verde, El Abra and Morenci mines if steps taken so far to improve the balance sheet are not enough.Also, copper prices have rallied 4.2% today to a nearly two-week high, sparked by the rally in Chinese and U.S. stocks, as well as other commodities.

Freeport McMoRan could double on copper, oil recovery, analyst says
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) could more than double from current depressed levels, Macquarie says as it reiterates its Outperform rating and $22 price target on the stock after the company recently said it would consider raising up to $1B via an equity sale.Macquarie thinks management is "averse to the liquidity raise at current price levels, but the decision shows commitment to preserving recovery potential while working to insure a smooth survival along the bottom."The firm says FCX's net debt will peak this year and return to a free cash flow within a year due to volume, grade and cost improvements, and a capital raise may not be necessary in the end, depending on commodity prices.As an example, copper pricing may gain support from FCX's move to streamline mining assets and reduce higher cost output; even though the firm does not foresee copper prices above $3/lb. before 2018, internal improvements could prove to be "enough" to drive the stock higher.

Freeport McMoRan's potential $1B dilution seen as necessary evil
Investors reacted in an unusual way to Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) plan to potentially sell $1B worth of stock, just weeks after saying it would prefer not to issue new shares: They pushed the stock 10.8% higher in the best performance in more than six years.While new shares will dilute value for existing holders, investors see it as a better option than selling more assets or taking its oil business public, says Morningstar analyst Daniel Rohr, who adds that “market expectations for oil prices just a few years down the road are pretty ugly, and in that environment you don’t want to be a seller."Heard On The Street says the reaction indicates the level of nervousness around FCX’s balance sheet. swollen with debt from the ill-conceived foray into oil; at this point, with copper and oil prices still falling, raising cash bolsters confidence even if it means dilution.Even if FCX nets $1B, the ratio of net debt per share to cash flow per share would be ~3.78x, down from 4.23x at the end of June but historically still very high, meaning that absent a commodities rally, FCX still has a long way to go.

Freeport McMoRan extends losses, now -18.5% in two days
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -10.3%) tumbles another 10% on continued weakness following yesterday's Q2 earnings report and the continuing decline in commodities, exacerbated by news that Chinese manufacturing activity hit a 15-month low; shares have shed ~18.5% in two days.Goldman Sachs says copper is headed for a seven-year-long bear market cycle after recently slumping to five-month lows; the firm cuts its three-, six- and 12-month copper price forecasts to a respective $5,200, $4,800 and $4,800 per ton from $5,500, $5,550 and $5,200, as well as its 2017 and 2018 forecasts to $4,500 from $7,000 and $8,000 respectively.Cowen cuts its FCX price target to $20 from $30, noting the combined forces of extreme negativism over commodities and idiosyncratic investor discontent have led to investor capitulation, yet the firm still sees value in the shares and would begin to selectively add positions upon further weakness (Briefing.com).

Freeport McMoRan -10% as "all options are on the table"
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -10.2%) tumbles to new 52-week lows amid uncertainty about the company’s direction and the outcome of its energy unit’s share sale, given the downward spiral for commodities."All options are on the table,” including asset sales and curtailing operations, CFO Richard Adkerson said in today's earnings conference call following a reported $1.85B Q2 loss.Although some of the decisions ultimately could prove beneficial, the breadth of possibilities is disconcerting to investors, says Clarkson analyst Jeremy Sussman.With copper prices at six-year lows and current oil prices still far below the $72/bbl carrying value on FCX's books, additional impairments could become necessary if conditions do not improve soon.

BHP guidance disappoints, Citi says
Citigroup analysts say BHP Billiton's (BHP -3.4%) FY 2016 guidance for declines in production of oil, coking coal and copper were larger than expected, and the guidance for increased iron ore production was also below expectations.While declines were expected due to field decline in oil and lower grades in copper, "it highlights the capital intensive nature of mining and that even $9B of capex does not drive production growth every year," CIti says, as it forecasts copper equivalent production growth of 2% in FY 2017."The beauty of diversification is that when one commodity is down, one of the others picks up the slack. That's not happening right now for BHP," says a mining analyst for Morgans Financial.Miners and related companies are hammered in early trading: CLF -13%, RIO -1.9%, VALE -2.5%, FCX -3.1%, OTCPK:AAUKY -3.9%, CAT -2.7%, JOY -1.2%.

China's stock turmoil whacks Freeport McMoRan, copper producers
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -7.3%) is the S&P 500's worst performer in early trading as copper prices retreat to five-month lows.Other global miners of copper, iron ore and other metals also are posting sharp losses: VALE -6.1%, BHP -3.8%, RIO -3.9%, SCCO -4.4%, TCK -6.4%.China’s stock market swoon is magnifying investor fears about weaker demand from one of the world’s largest consumers of raw materials.Overnight, the S&P, Goldman Sachs and the Bloomberg commodity indexes fell the most since November, and analysts say the worst is yet to come."China's demand stumble comes at an awkward time, just when more and more supply of raw materials is coming on stream in many sectors. No quick fix in sight," says HSBC co-head of Asian economic research Frederic Neumann.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Jul. 7, 2015, 10:23 AM | 10 Comments

Freeport McMoRan's EPS may have bottomed, Morgan Stanley says
Freeport McMoRan's (FCX +3.3%) Q1 may have represented a multiyear trough in earnings and free cash flow due to upcoming lower costs and volume growth, Morgan Stanley says in reiterating its Outperform rating and $29 price target.EPS and free cash flow should not fall below the Q1 run rate in the rest of 2015 or 2016-18, even if copper falls to $2.50/lb., Stanley says, seeing minimal execution risk as three key projects are close enough to delivering 28% volume growth in 2016.Energy cash burn should fall as volumes rise as a good portion of current capex is applied towards longer dated projects, but FCX needs to increase confidence in growth projects, the firm says.

Copper prices rally to 2015 high on hopes for global demand
Copper prices have risen to a 2015 high and their highest levels since November, as global demand is seen driving prices.A series of stimulus programs from China in recent months has helped convince investors that the world’s largest copper consumer is serious about steadying its economic slowdown; at the same time, disruptions in copper mining and supplies have sparked a belief that the market may end the year with global production and demand nearly balanced, rather than with a supply surplus.Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, ]]GLNCY]]), the world's no. 3 copper miner, reported its Q1 copper production fell 9% Y/Y, partly due to a planned shutdown for maintenance at its Collahuasi mine in Chile; disruptions at operations owned by BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) also have fueled speculation that a global surplus will shrink this year.ETFs: JJC, DBB, CPER, BOM, RJZ, BOS, BDD, JJM, CUPM May 5, 2015, 5:24 PM
Freeport McMoRan +3.5% after Morgan Stanley upgrade
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +3.5%) moves higher after Morgan Stanley upgrades shares to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $29 price target, as higher volumes and declining costs mitigate concerns about financing needs.FCX's copper growth projects are near "an inflection point," Stanley says, forecasting production increases at copper mines will drive a 28% Y/Y increase in volumes, 22% decline in cash costs, and a 14% decline in total capex in 2016The firm says operating cash flow should exceed capex by $1.7B in 2016 and $2.3B in 2017; even if copper prices collapse to near marginal cost, the firm does not expect FCX to burn cash in 2016-17, meaning 2015 is the only “bridge year” when the company burns cash, prompting less concern about financing needs to achieve growth targets.

Freeport McMoRan considers IPO of U.S. E&P business, vindicating skeptics
Two years after its much criticized $9B purchase of two energy exploration companies, Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is considering spinning them off or selling a minority stake - although the company apparently would retain a “significant interest” in any spun-off entity.A possible IPO of stock in the oil and gas business could take place late this year and would highlight the stand-alone value of the business, Jim Flores, vice-chairman of FCX and CEO of the company’s energy business, said in today's earnings conference call."If this is the path that Freeport ultimately chooses, it clearly indicates that management’s quest to find a strategic investor in its energy business has not worked,” says Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina.In its Q1 results, FCX reported a $3.1B loss for impairment of oil and gas properties, and said the cash margin in its oil division fell to $23.45/boe from $58.71 a year ago with revenue slumping by more than half to $547M from $1.2B.FCX's debt - now up to $20.3B - ballooned with its 2013 acquisition of two oil and natural gas producers, as it diversified its business beyond copper, gold and molybdenum mining.

Freeport McMoRan hurt by oil assets, weak commodity prices in Q1 loss
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -3.6%) opens sharply lower after reporting a Q1 loss and recording $2.4B in one-time charges, mainly for the reduction of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties.Q1 consolidated copper sales of 960M lbs. were slightly higher than the company's January estimate of 950M lbs., reflecting timing of shipments, and were higher than Q1 2014 sales of 871M lbs., reflecting higher volumes in North America, Indonesia and Africa.Q1 consolidated gold sales of 263K oz. were higher than the January estimate of 225K oz. and Q1 2014 sales of 187K oz., reflecting higher operating rates at PT-FI.FCX says it is taking actions to reduce or defer capex and other costs, and is evaluating funding alternatives to advance growth projects in its oil and gas business, including consideration of a sale of public equity for a minority interest in its oil and gas subsidiary.Capital spending is estimated at $6.5B for the year, including $2.5B for major mining projects and $2.8B for oil and gas operations.

Freeport falls to moderate loss as drastic dividend cut viewed as prudent
Investors largely take in stride Freeport McMoRan's (FCX -0.7%) 84% dividend cut, apparently agreeing with analysts at Jefferies who say the cut was “sensible” because it saves the company $1.1B/year of cash.FCX "is not entirely out of the woods yet as macro risks clearly remain, but this dividend reduction is a step in the right direction and could indicate a bottom in Freeport shares," says the firm's Christopher LaFemina.The dividend was so high that investors probably knew that paying out $1.25/year might be hard to continue, but an 84% cut - particularly with the recent bounce in copper prices - is a message that FCX is "worried about more than just the next few earnings reports," 24/7's Jon Ogg writes.Dividend cuts are rare in the energy and materials sector, points out S&P's Howard Silverblatt, who wonders what Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.9%) will do next month when it reports earnings; after increasing its dividend for 32 straight years, Silverblatt says the more pertinent question is not if, but by how much.

Peabody Energy slumps after Jefferies downgrade
Peabody Energy (BTU -5.6%) slides sharply after Jefferies downgrades shares to Hold from Buy with a $6 price target, cut from $10, on continued concerns about domestic thermal coal fundamentals due to low natural gas prices, weakening exports, MATS related coal plant closures and increased renewable capacity.BTU's Australian coal business is more likely to improve in the near-term due to higher seaborne thermal coal prices, the firm says, but operating costs have not declined nearly as much as competitors due to its extensive hedging program.Jefferies is bearish on mining shares in the near-term, and the firm revised many of its commodity price forecasts lower, but it has placed four metals and mining stocks above the rest: Freeport McMoRan (FCX -3.5%), Rio Tinto (RIO -2.6%), First Quantum (OTCPK:FQVLF -6.8%) and Angofagasta (OTCPK:ANFGY -5.8%).

Indonesia sets Newmont deadline for Freeport smelter deal
Newmont Mining's (NEM -0.3%) Indonesian copper export permit will not be renewed beyond March 19 unless it strikes a deal with Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) to invest in the latter's planned smelter, a mines ministry official says.NEM has said multiple studies show its Batu Hijau mine cannot sustain a smelter on its own, while fellow U.S.-based miner FCX is pushing ahead with expansion plans at Indonesia's sole copper smelter at Gresik.After a nine-month export tax dispute, NEM signed a deal with the government late last year that allowed for the resumption of copper concentrate exports, but the agreement is set to end unless NEM can show it is serious about domestic processing.

Indonesia to allow mine contract extension earlier than two years out
Indonesia's government will start allowing miners to renew contracts earlier than two years before they expire, a move that would favor Freeport McMoran (FCX -0.6%) and its expansion plans in the country.FCX, which runs the Grasberg copper and gold mining complex, has for years been seeking contract certainty before investing the $15B-plus needed to turn its Indonesia asset into the world's biggest underground mine after 2016.FCX's current deal is due to expire in 2021 but Indonesia's energy and mineral resources minister says a government decision on an extension would be reached before by this July.Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) has a joint venture with FCX for a 40% share of Grasberg's production above specific levels until 2021, and 40% of all production after 2021.

Freeport McMoRan could cut dividend in Q1, Morgan Stanley says
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +3.3%) may combine a dividend cut announcement with some incremental cost-cutting through an energy joint venture, lower capex or idling of high-cost production sometime during Q1, Morgan Stanley says as it cuts its FCX price target to $25 from $30 and 2015 EPS by 26%.Stanley still sees near-term risks for FCX despite the 57% decline in shares since Q3 and management actions to boost free cash flow, citing continuing low visibility in Indonesia, vulnerability of further declines in copper prices and the potential dividend cut.At spot commodity prices, the firm forecasts FCX 2015 EBITDA could be near $4.7B vs. consensus for $7.1B, with cash burn near $1.5B before dividend.

Freeport faces adjustments, drops previous debt reduction targets, CEO says
This will be a year of adjustments amid uncertain commodity markets, but "we're not backing away from our objectives of reducing leverage, and going forward we're going to continue to prioritize debt reduction," Freeport McMoRan (FCX -5.9%) CEO Richard Adkerson says in today's earnings conference call.Copper's long-term fundamentals are strong, the CEO says, adding that FCX’s strength is its long-term reserves, and these will kick into high gear as prices rise, generating cash flows; FCX expects to produce 5.4B lbs. of copper in 2016, up from 4.3B lbs. this year.The company's expansion into energy exploration inflated FCX's debt to $19B at year-end 2014; with commodity prices at current levels, its debt target of $12B by year-end 2016 target is now unrealistic, Adkerson says.FCX is counting on Chinese demand for copper to grow ~5%/year while it could be only in the low single digits, Morningstar's Dan Rohr says; another risk for the company is that its two lowest cash-cost mines are in politically volatile Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Citigroup's Brian Yu kept his Hold rating on the stock, saying Q4 copper results and oil and gas margins came in weaker than expectations and 2015 guidance for both was reduced.Earlier: Freeport McMoRan cuts 2015 capital budget by $2B Jan. 27, 2015, 3:49 PM | 12 Comments
Freeport McMoRan cuts 2015 capital budget by $2B
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) -5.5% premarket after missing expectations for Q4 earnings and saying that it has cut 2015 capital spending by $2B with the possibility of further cuts ahead.Says it is taking "aggressive actions" to defer or reduce capital spending, and is seeking third-party funding for much of its oil and gas expenditures "to maintain financial strength and flexibility" in response to the drop in oil prices.FCX says its Q4 copper sales fell to 972M lbs. from 1.14B lbs. in the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the sale of Candelaria in Nov. 2014 and lower sales from Cerro Verde and Indonesia, while gold sales fell to 377K oz. from 512K oz.Q4 average realized prices for copper fell 10.9% Y/Y, gold prices fell 2.2%, and oil prices declined 15.8% from a year earlier.

Morgan Stanley sees dividends at risk for Freeport McMoRan, Teck Resources
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and Teck Resources (NYSE:TCK) may announce dividend cuts with their upcoming quarterly reports, Morgan Stanley says, as the firm thinks it is too early to get bullish on copper equities while it remains unclear if pricing has troughed.Stanley estimates FCX’s 2015 free cash flow (excluding $1.3B in dividends) at a loss of $2.5B-$3B, and expects capex cuts to reduce cash burn; it also anticipates a cut in dividends, currently $1.25/share and more than 100% payout ratio on 2015 estimated EPS at spot.The firm foresees large upside in TCK shares if Fort Hills is suspended, but recent comments suggest work on the project will continue for now; it estimates TCK’s 2015 free cash flow (excluding C$500M in dividends) at a loss of ~C$500M, suggesting risk to the dividend.

Goldman's reduced iron ore outlook drags down big miners
Iron ore miners are broadly lower after Goldman Sachs becomes the latest global bank to deliver a dismal outlook for the steel-making ingredient, forecasting an average price of $66/metric ton this year from an earlier estimate of $80.Goldman is at least the fifth bank this month to lower estimates, citing rising seaborne supplies and weaker demand growth from China; just last week, Citigroup cut its iron ore forecast to $58 in 2015, down from its earlier $65, and UBS lowered its target to $66 from $85.Low-cost expansions likely will continue as major producers are still mining iron ore at a profit, which would expand the global seaborne surplus from 47M tons this year to 260M tons by 2018, Goldman says.Iron ore miners: VALE -8%, BHP -3%, RIO -3.6%, CLF -7.6%.Copper miners: FCX -2.6%, SCCO -2.4%, TCK -2.6%.Steel companies: X -6.3%, MT -7.1%, AKS -3.2%, NUE -1.2%, STLD -3%, CMC -3.8%, TMST -2.4%.Earlier: Goldman gives in on mined commodities Jan. 23, 2015, 11:18 AM | 23 Comments

Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) says it plans to invest ~$17B to build a copper smelter and develop its gold and copper mines in Indonesia.The head of the Freeport Indonesia unit says the company will invest more than $2B to build a smelter with an annual processing capacity of 2M metric tons, and spend another $15Bn on long-term development of underground copper and gold deposits at its Grasberg mine complex in Papua.The move came after the Indonesian government said it would ban the FCX local unit from shipping copper concentrate outside the country.FCX +1.3% premarket.

Freeport McMoRan settlement leaves Credit Suisse on a limb
Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) settlement of a shareholder lawsuit over a pair of acquisitions leaves Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), its counselor on the deals, facing the possibility that it could be forced to defend itself against the shareholders, who said in the court filing that they want to bring a case against the bank.The $137.5M settlement, one of the largest ever in such a case, explicitly allows shareholders to pursue claims against CS, which the plaintiffs say made a mathematical error that inflated the value of one of the acquired companies.While deal-related lawsuits against companies are commonplace, shareholders on occasion have started going after the banks that have advised them; in a sign of its unease over the possibility it will be targeted next, CS reportedly sought in recent weeks to join the settlement talks after earlier declining offers to do so.

Barclays bullish on steel, neutral on copper, cool on coal
Barclays is bullish on steel producers thanks to improving U.S. steel demand that should offset the downward trend in steel pricing, neutral on copper miners as lower than expected metal supply will outweigh a slowdown in Chinese consumption growth, and cautious on coal as low nat gas prices along with growing utility regulations and slowing Chinese demand for imported coal will hurt demand.In steel, the firm's Overweight-rated steel stocks Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) stand to gain from steel consumption growth from the U.S. construction, manufacturing and automotive industries while offering little direct exposure to the troubled energy sector.In copper, both Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) boast high-probability mining expansion projects over the next two years, but Barclays considers pure-play SCCO's overall risk profile more favorable.In coal, Cloud Peak (NYSE:CLD) offers a relatively healthy balance sheet and reasonable valuation on realistic pricing, while Alpha Natural (NYSE:ANR) and Arch Coal (NYSE:ACI) struggle under heavy debt from ill-timed acquisitions exacerbated by very slim profitability.

Dividend cuts "likely" coming for Teck and Freeport, analyst says
Teck Resources (TCK -1.1%) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.2%) are likely to slash dividends and capital spending if copper prices remain at depressed levels, Deutsche Bank analyst Jorge Beristain says.Even those moves would not be enough to offset low prices, Beristain believes, meaning equity raises could be the “next possible step."The analyst thinks FCX has plenty of room to cut spending on the energy side but TCK has less flexibility, as it has committed to spend ~$700M/year on the Fort Hills oil sands project over the next three years.

Freeport McMoRan settles litigation over acquisitions
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +1.2%) reportedly has reached a $137.5M settlement of shareholder litigation that accused it of overpaying in the 2013 acquisitions of two oil and gas producers.The agreement resolves claims that FCX rescued McMoRan Exploration in 2013 to protect its own stake in the company and those of several insiders; FCX paid a combined $9B for the affiliated company and rival Plains Exploration, which had veto power over any sale of McMoRan.Shareholders will receive net settlement proceeds through a special dividend.Probably more relevant to today's stock price gain is a rebound in copper prices following the metal's biggest one-day price drop in more than three years.

Citi cuts targets for iron ore, major mining stocks
Citi cuts price targets for iron ore to $58 for 2015 and $62 for 2016, down from its prior estimates of $65 for both years, and lowers its outlook for thermal and met coal.Citi warns its downwardly revised forecast means it now expects earnings for major mining companies will fall by 9%-21% for 2015 and by 3%-16% in 2016.Rio Tinto (RIO -2.5%) is the exception, as Citi sees earnings rising 7.1% this year and 10.6% next year due to the company’s greater exposure to the weaker Australian dollar.The firm cuts its price target for Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF -7.2%) by 8% to £3.60 from £3.90 and sees earnings falling 21% and 16% respectively in 2015 and 2016.Citi says it is still bullish on the sector, but warns that metals and mining companies will only slowly grind higher over the next few years.Also: BHP -4.5%, VALE -5%, FCX -12%, SCCO -4.9%, TCK -9.7%, CLF -4.4%, CENX -9.1%, MT -4.2%, X -4.9%, NUE -3.4%, STLD -2.6%, BTU -9.8%, ANR -8.8%, ACI -8.9%.

Freeport McMoRan -11% as copper collapses
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -10.8%) sinks to a 52-week low as copper prices fall 4.5% to collapse to 2009 levels, though it is off overnight lows after prices were down nearly 9% at one point in London.Other big global miners also are sharply lower: SCCO -7.3%, RIO -2.5%, BHP -4.4%, VALE -3.8%, CLF -5.8%.Concerns over a supply glut and slowing consumption in China have weighed on copper prices in recent months; copper is often seen as an omen for the global economy because it is used in a wide array of construction and manufacturing activities, so today's precipitous drop explains much of the weakness in global equity markets.The iPath Dow Jones UBS Copper Subindex Total Return ETN (NYSEARCA:JJC) is trading so heavily that nearly 60% of the average full-day volume traded in the first 10 minutes this morning.ETFs: CPER, CUPM, DBB, BOM, RJZ, BOS, BDD, JJM, RGRI, UBM, BDG, USMI, HEVY Jan. 14, 2015, 10:28 AM | 5 Comments

Freeport McMoRan slides as copper prices hit lowest since August 2009
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -3.4%) sinks for a second straight day as copper prices fall to fresh five-year lows, with investors running away from commodities in the wake of falling oil prices and a rising dollar.Comex copper for March delivery recently was 2.9% lower at $2.6475/lb., the steepest drop for copper since Nov. 28 and the lowest price since Aug. 2009.The oil market’s influence on copper is overwhelming any positive effects of trade data from China which showed imports from the world’s biggest copper consumer hit an all-time high last year.Deutsche Bank cuts its price target for the shares to $36 from $40 on expectations of further challenges for metals companies this year.

Freeport should build two new Indonesia copper smelters, government says
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) needs to build two Indonesian copper smelters for ~$4B by 2020, a government official says as talks resume over the miner's future in the country.As part of July's MOU with Indonesia's government that ended a six-month tax dispute and paved the way for the resumption of copper concentrate exports, FCX agreed to develop a $2.3B smelter by 2017; the government is now asking the company to build a second smelter by 2020 for another ~$1.5B.FCX is working with Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) on the building of the first smelter, which is expected to process 1.6M metric tons/year of copper concentrate into copper cathode.

BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto move to dominate in copper
BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) are amassing vast copper holdings in a push to capture a greater chunk of the $140B world market, apparently aiming to squeeze out high-cost producers just as they did in the global iron ore business, Reuters reports.Separately and in joint ventures, Rio and BHP intend to mine millions of additional tons of copper, despite seeing an oversupplied market for the next few years.While Rio and BHP likely would not hold the same degree of dominance over copper that they do in iron ore - Codelco, Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY) and Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX) will remain bigger producers for the foreseeable future - their influence on global supply would be enhanced.The drive in copper also could give BHP and Rio an advantage over rival Vale (NYSE:VALE), whose exposure to copper is less than half that of BHP and Rio.

Freeport McMoRan resumes processing at Arizona copper smelter
Freeport McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) operations at its sole U.S. copper smelter have returned to normal production levels after it completed repairs on an electric furnace damaged in a fire.FCX temporarily shut the smelter in mid-November after a fire broke out as molten copper breached a processing vessel and flowed onto the ground.The Arizona smelter has capacity to produce 180K metric tons/year, ~14% of annual U.S. output.

Goldman: Freeport McMoRan could cut capex and/or dividends to reduce debt
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +3.2%) is maintained with a Neutral rating and $31 price target at Goldman Sachs, which sees recent deflation in crude and copper raising heighten leverage concerns.The fall in oil and copper prices has brought into focus the debt reduction FCX has targeted for year-end 2016, analyst Sal Tharani says: "FCX is highly exposed to both of these commodities and we feel current weakness, if persistent, could heighten investors’ concerns about its leveraged balance sheet."FCX will not be able to fulfill its $12B debt reduction target by 2016 and may even increase its net debt by $1B from current levels, which Tharani believes could cause the company to "drastically" cut its capex and/or dividends.

Freeport McMoRan nears settlement over McMoRan, Plains deals
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) reportedly is nearing a settlement of more than $100M to resolve allegations its board and executives had conflicts of interest while negotiating the company’s purchase of McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration last year.The agreement would resolve a lawsuit filed by some FCX shareholders alleging the company overpaid when it bought the two affiliates for $9B.Ties between the three companies, including overlapping board members and ownership stakes, led to claims that FCX had used the veil of a strategic acquisition to bail out McMoRan; shareholders also alleged that to seal the deal, FCX also swallowed Plains, which had veto power over the McMoRan transaction.

Copper companies optimistic about medium-term prices
Top copper execs say prices could be held down by rising supply from mines in the next couple of years but then could surge due to a lack of large projects and bottlenecks at refineries.Copper demand growth of 3%-4% per year over the next five years means 4M-5M metric tons of new supply - the equivalent of 10-12 big mines - would be needed, but the mines do not exist, according to Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.2%) senior VP Javier Targhetta, saying, "We may see two or three big productions in the next few years but the impact will be diluted by falling production and grades. So I'm extremely optimistic as for where markets will be."Southern Copper (SCCO -1.6%) CEO Oscar Gonzalez Rocha sees 2015 copper prices at ~$3.15/lb. but "with quite a lot of upside potential."Prices could hit a record $5/lb. over the next 4-5 years, given the lack of major new mines on the horizon and as rising impurities such as arsenic force up costs for miners, Codelco CEO Nelson Pizzaro says.

Freeport says U.S. smelter could be shut for several more weeks
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) says it expects repairs to its sole U.S. copper smelter, which was shuttered last week after a fire, to last into December.The shutdown comes as companies that use copper to make wire and plumbing hammer out terms of next year's supply contracts; a prolonged shutdown would raise concerns about U.S. supplies of refined copper, as Rio Tinto's (NYSE:RIO) big smelter in Utah struggles with low ore grades.FCX's Arizona smelter has capacity to produce 180K metric tons/year, ~14% of annual U.S. output.

Lower oil prices spark rise in energy bond activity
Nearly $17B in energy company debt has been sold in the U.S. so far this month, tapping into debt capital markets despite a rise in borrowing costs as they seek to refinance or pay off existing debt amid a slump in oil prices.Just this week, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) offered $4B in six tranches to repay commercial paper, while Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) sold $3B in bonds in part to refinance existing debt; last week's ~$10B of energy bonds sold included a $3B offer by ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) also intended for refinancing purposes.Other energy-related deals in the pipeline for the coming days include a new loan facility for C&J Energy Services (NYSE:CJES).Energy bonds have been under pressure in the past couple of weeks as oil prices skid; investors are worried that a further drop in oil prices could put pressure on the highly indebted companies in the sector and potentially trigger a wave of debt restructurings.

Freeport sees reduced copper output at Grasberg mine in Indonesia

Freeport deal could ward off Glencore for Rio Tinto, analysts speculate
Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) may decide that its best defense against another takeover approach from Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY) is buying the likes of Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) in a "classic kind of defensive move," Bernstein analyst Paul Gait speculates.While Rio is saying it’s better off going it alone, a deal for FCX could help it ward off any further advances from Glencore as well as provide a way to lessen its dependence on iron ore at a time when the metal is slumping, Gait says.FCX "fits all the criteria of an attractive takeout candidate and would make sense for... anyone looking to increase their copper exposure and getting some very high-margin energy assets at the same time,” BB&T's Garrett Nelson adds.FCX shares are now at their cheapest in more than 15 months relative to EBITDA.

Newmont reaches deal to resume Indonesian copper exports
Newmont Mining (NEM -2.4%) has reached a tentative agreement to resume exporting copper concentrate from Indonesia as early as this week, the government says.According to a top mining industry official, NEM will pay an export tax of 7.5% on its copper concentrate, which is the same rate Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) negotiated early and significantly lower than the government originally asked; NEM also will increase royalties to 3.75% from 1% for gold, to 4% from 3.5% for copper, and to 3.25% from 1% for silver.Although an agreement has been reached in principle, the deal still needs to be approved by several government officials, including the chief economics minister, before an MoU is signed by both parties.

Freeport McMoRan downgraded at Stifel, Grasberg export restart is priced in
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is downgraded to Hold from Buy at Stifel, which says shares already reflect the restart of exports from Indonesia.Stifel views the memorandum of understanding FCX signed last month with the Indonesian government as a step in the right direction since it removes the near-term overhang on shares, although it believes the 18% rally from March lows suggests the market had been expecting a deal; bigger questions regarding mine ownership and permits beyond 2021 remain, the firm says.FCX -1% premarket.

Freeport McMoRan upgraded to Buy at Argus
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +1.2%) is upgraded to Buy from Hold with a $42 price target at Argus, based on reduced copper mining capacity, expectations for stronger copper demand in the near term, and the stock's favorable valuation.The firm expects increased demand for copper to boost pricing in H2; while this likely will drive a new round of capacity increases, it expects the process to take at least a year, allowing FCX to benefit from higher copper prices in the near term.

Newmont seeks injunction to reopen Indonesia copper mine
Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) says it is applying for an injunction to get workers back to its Batu Hijau mine, as the miner continues to take a hard line in its dispute with Indonesia's government over a controversial tax on copper exports.NEM CEO Gary Goldberg says it could take several months to obtain a ruling on interim relief and at least several weeks to ramp back up to full production if relief is granted.The CEO says NEM would continue to try to resolve the dispute through talks with the government while also pursuing arbitration, but has no plans to visit Indonesia while he is in the Asia-Pacific region over the next week.Fellow miner Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has resumed copper concentrate exports after agreeing last month to a reduced export duty of 7.5%.Earlier: Newmont Mining opens to restarting Barrick Gold merger talks; shares +0.9% premarket.

Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) says it has reached a deal with the Indonesian government that is expected to pave the way for a resumption of copper exports after a six-month halt.After signing the memorandum of understanding, Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto says he hopes copper concentrate exports could resume as soon as next month.FCX will pay a 7.5% tax on its Indonesia copper exports and provide a $115M assurance bond to support its commitment to smelter development; it will pay royalties of 4% for copper and 3.75% for gold, which previously were 3.5% and 1%, respectively.FCX, which fell sharply yesterday as terms of the deal leaked out, -0.3% premarket.

Freeport to resume exports from Indonesia, but investors don't like terms
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -2.1%) is set to restart concentrate shipments from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, but shares are lower as the verdict on the deal with the government isn't favorable.Indonesia reportedly will cut the tax levied on mineral concentrate exports to less than 10% for miners that pay a bond as a guarantee they will build a smelter later.As part of its deal, FCX would pay higher royalties of 4% on copper sales, after paying between 1.5% and 3.5% under an old deal, and the higher rate will bring it into line with royalties paid by other companies.In response to the deal and FCX's mixed Q2 earnings, BofA/Merrill downgrades shares to Neutral from Buy and cuts its price target to $40 from $43.Indonesian officials say no talks have taken place with the second-largest copper miner in the country, Newmont Mining (NEM -2%).

Freeport McMoRan eyes $4B-$5B in asset sales to accelerate debt reduction
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.1%) plans to sell $4B-$5B more in onshore assets to help reduce debt and pay for "hundreds of millions of dollars" of investments in the Gulf of Mexico, Vice Chairman Jim Flores said during today's earnings call.FCX sees potential for faster growth and better returns by refocusing its oil and gas portfolio in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and will look to sell assets with less potential for growth, CEO Richard Adkerson says (Q2 earnings).FCX's debt has ballooned from $3.5B to more than $20B after it bought two oil and gas companies last year, and it is facing lower copper prices than when it announced the purchases; export curbs that restricted output from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia also has hurt earnings this year.

Freeport McMoRan revenue rises, helped by entry into oil and gas
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) posted lower than expected Q2 earnings but revenues rose 28% and beat expectations, lifted in part by its entry into the oil and gas business.Q2 copper sales rose 1.8% Y/Y, and gold sales fell 8%, while FCX sold 16M boe, up from 5M last year which only included one month of operations.Average realized prices for copper and gold fell from a year earlier.Cash production costs for oil and gas operations of $19.57/boe were higher than the $16.58/boe a year ago mostly because of higher operating costs in California.Says it expects to sign a deal with the Indonesian government “imminently” to resume exports of partly processed ore from the country, where it operates its Grasberg mine.FCX -0.3% premarket.

Cliffs' Q2 earnings estimate cut at J.P. Morgan
Amid Cliffs Natural Resources' (CLF -5%) proxy battle with Casablanca Capital - including today’s letter from CLF urging shareholders to vote the white card - J.P. Morgan analysts cut their Q2 EPS estimate to a $0.34 loss from a $0.19 gain ahead of the company's earnings report this Thursday.JPM cites marking iron ore prices to market during the quarter - 11% lower than its previous forecast - and factoring in expected weather related shipment disruptions and associated higher costs in the Great Lakes; iron ore cargo vessels reportedly could not sail without an ice-breaking escort until mid-May and traffic was down substantially in April.Freeport McMoRan (FCX +0.3%), which is set to release its results on Wednesday, also had its forecasts trimmed, reflecting the Grasberg mine operating at only ~50% of capacity due to its current inability to export concentrate from Indonesia.

Indonesia threatens takeover of Newmont mine if output stays shut
Newmont Mining (NEM +0.4%) risks its Indonesian mining license being taken over by a state-owned firm if it does not resume copper production, Indonesia's government warns in a hardening of its stance.The mining ministry earlier this week said it could terminate NEM's mining contract in response to the halt in production and the filing of legal arbitration over the country's new export rules.The current government has only three months left in office, and the probable next president has signaled a more conciliatory approach to the contract dispute with NEM and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).

Indonesia threatens to end Newmont's mining contract over lawsuit
Indonesia could terminate Newmont Mining's (NEM -2.4%) copper mine contract if the company does not withdraw a legal challenge to its export taxes, a high ranking government official says."By stopping production, they are making our state revenues decline so we can say that they have defaulted," according to the director general of coal and minerals at the mining ministry, adding NEM's contract could be revoked 90 days after the government declares it to be in default or negligent.Critics have said NEM's challenge is risky in a country where open confrontation is often frowned upon; Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.3%), which also has sharply reduced Indonesian operations, has continued to hold high-level talks with the government in hopes of avoiding a lawsuit.

Freeport says draft MoU agreed but not signed, no export timeframe set
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.4%) confirms its agreement to a draft memorandum with the Indonesian government on a contract renegotiation, but cautions that the memorandum has not yet been signed and there is no timeframe for any resumption of copper exports.Under the draft MoU, government officials say FCX has agreed to divest 30% of its Indonesian unit, pay a royalty of 4% for copper sales and 3.75% for gold sales - up from 1% previously - and will build a smelter and pay the government a repayable bond.The deal is due to be discussed at a cabinet meeting this week and finalized within two weeks, according to Indonesia's industry minister, but any contract agreement could still fail when a new government takes office in October.While FCX uses the carrot approach, Newmont Mining (NEM -0.3%) uses the stick, idling its Indonesian operations as part of a potential exit strategy to reflect its smaller operations, which analysts say can't justify a stand-alone smelter.

Newmont Mining's hardball tactics could raise tensions in Indonesia
Newmont Mining's (NEM) force majeure declaration at its Batu Hijau copper mine in Indonesia was a surprising move but illustrates how its tactics in dealing with the government in the dispute over export taxes have differed from Freeport McMoRan (FCX).FCX is much more heavily invested in the country, with more to lose by picking a fight with the government, according to Bernstein's Ignace Proot; FCX employs 30K-plus people in Indonesia, more than 7x as many as NEM, and is planning an ambitious new underground copper mine."It makes sense for Newmont to do this now, because they have inventory built up for the holiday season, and there'll be a new president in the fall," who might renegotiate the export taxes, Proot says.NEM has been vocal in discussing the possibility of taking Indonesia to arbitration, while FCX has proceeded cautiously and its CEO met with government officials this week; FCX has indicated it was close to reaching an agreement, which could involve getting a break on taxes in exchange for helping to build a new smelter.

Newmont declares force majeure at Indonesian copper mine
Newmont Mining (NEM) says it has declared force majeure at its Batu Hijau copper mine in Indonesia and plans to put most of the mine's employees on leave with reduced pay.NEM says the mine will be placed under care and maintenance, although it will continue shipping concentrate from storage to Indonesia's only copper smelter, which would allow for copper concentrate shipments of 81K metric tons through year's end.The move comes as NEM and Freeport McMoRan (FCX) are said to be making progress in their dispute with Indonesia's government over an export tax imposed in January.

Freeport, Newmont said to agree in principle to Indonesia export tax
Foreign copper miners in Indonesia have agreed in principle to pay an export tax, the country's deputy finance minister says, following talks aimed at restarting concentrate exports after a five-month halt.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX +1.5%) and Newmont Mining (NEM +0.4%), which together account for 97% of Indonesia's copper output, had argued they should be exempt from the tax as introduced in January, which kicks in at 25% and rises to 60% in 2016 before a total concentrate export ban in 2017.FCX CFO Kathleen Quirk tells an investor conference in Chicago today that the company expects to resume exports very soon and the export tax would be "significantly reduced."Copper for July delivery, the most actively traded contract, suffers its biggest one-day drop since April as a resolution nears; also there are concerns that a probe of metals warehousing at a Chinese port could hurt demand if China clamps down on copper-based financing.ETFs; JJC, CPER, CUPM Jun. 4, 2014, 3:13 PM

Nabors Industries' chief Petrello was highest-paid CEO in 2013
The highest-paid boss in America may come as a surprise: It's Nabors Industries (NBR -0.4%) CEO Anthony Petrello, who made $68.3M in 2013 as a result of a $60M lump sum the company paid him to buy out his old contract.Since becoming CEO in Oct. 2011, NBR shares are up ~180%, pretty good but not good enough to escape shareholder outrage; earlier this year, NBR finally agreed to change its corporate governance and compensation practices.Freeport McMoRan (FCX) CEO Richard Adkerson also received a one-time payment of $36.7M to renegotiate his contract; his $55.3M in total pay made him the third-highest paid CEO among S&P 500 companies last year.The second-highest paid CEO was CBS' Leslie Moonves of CBS, whose total compensation rose 9% to $65.6M; media industry CEOs were paid handsomely, as usual: Viacom’s (VIA, VIAB) Philippe Dauman made $37.2M, Disney’s (DIS) Robert Iger made $34.3M, and Time Warner's (TWX) Jeffrey Bewkes earned $32.5M.The head of a typical large public company earned a record $10.5M, up 8.8% from $9.6M in 2012, according to an AP pay study.

Freeport McMoRan Q1 earnings fall but beat estimates, +2% premarket
Freeport McMoRan (FCX) +2% premarket after Q1 earnings fell 21% Y/Y, hurt by lower copper prices and higher costs, but results topped analyst expectations.FCX previously had raised its copper production despite weaker demand and lower prices, but output fell 3.3% during Q1 to 948M lbs., with average realized price/lb. falling to $3.14 from $3.51 a year earlier, partly due to the conflict with Indonesia's government that has halted its copper concentrate exports from the country.Total gold production also declined, falling 1.7% to 231K oz., with average realized price/oz. falling to $1,300 from $1,606.Gross margin narrowed to 25.7% from 33.5% as input costs rose 21% to $3.7B; capital spending totaled $1.61B, double the year-ago period, and FCX continues to expect $7B in capital spending for the year, up from $5.3B last year.FCX's oil and gas unit sold 16.1M boe, beating its forecast of 15.3M, primarily reflecting higher Eagle Ford production volumes.

Indonesia mines ministry seeks cut in export tax for Freeport, Newmont
Indonesia's mining ministry is recommending a sharp cut in the export tax imposed on Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and Newmont Mining (NEM), according to a senior government official, but the proposal still appears to fall short of the companies' request.Mining officials want the finance ministry to lower the export tax to no more than 10% for FCX and NEM from the surprise 25% imposed in January that has halted copper shipments, but the firms have agreed only to pay 5% to go toward building a smelter.Meanwhile, FCX has made unspecified cuts to its ~30K workforce at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, as the tax dispute with the government drags on.

Alcoa upgraded at Deutsche Bank, may be turning around
Alcoa (AA) is upgraded to Hold from Sell with a $10 price target, up from $7.50, at Deutsche Bank, which cites its expectation of higher realized aluminum prices for the foreseeable future; however, the firm sees continued downside risk given the increasingly “black-box" nature of regional premia price support.A weekend WSJ report says Alcoa, which reports Q1 earnings tomorrow, may be turning around due to its commitment to using aluminum for cars as it invests $575M to expand new lines in Iowa and Tennessee, and aluminum producers have began to cut capacity to try to counteract a glut.The firm reiterates Buy ratings on Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) due to potential near-to-medium term catalysts - resumption of Indonesia copper exports for FCX and progress towards monetization of the Bloom Lake mine for CLF.

Freeport, Newmont move higher as Indonesia pushes for exports to resume
Indonesia has approved big increases in 2014 copper sales for local units of copper miners Freeport McMoRan (FCX +1.2%) and Newmont Mining (NEM +4.6%), as the country pushes for the companies to resume exports.FCX appears to have received a go-ahead to resume copper shipments via a deal that would require it to build a smelter in exchange for a reprieve on Indonesia's new export tax.The government approves targets for 10%-plus increases in FCX's copper concentrate sales and copper concentrate export sales from its Grasberg mine in Papua, and to raise copper concentrate sales from NEM's Batu Hijau mine in Sumbawa by 66% and hike export sales from the mine by 70%.

Newmont Mining (NEM -3.1%) denies it has cut production at its Batu Hijau Indonesian copper and gold mine, after the government's mineral enterprise director claimed earlier in the day that production had been slashed by 70%.NEM and Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.8%) have halted copper concentrate exports while continuing talks with the government over the ban on mineral ore exports and the introduction of an escalating export tax for concentrates.Before the new export rules, FCX had estimated that total copper in concentrate output from Indonesia would total 500K metric tons this year, while NEM forecast output at 110K-125K metric tons.

Bloomberg: Freeport seeking buyers for New Mexico power plant stake
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +1.4%) reportedly is working with Wells Fargo to find buyers for its one-third stake worth as much as $200M in its Luna Energy 600 MW New Mexico power plant that supplies electricity to its local mines.FCX is cutting spending and seeking asset sales to cut debt after buying two oil and gas companies last year for $9B, and the company is said to want to take advantage of the strong demand for gas-fired power plants.

Freeport numbers trimmed at Nomura
Troubles in Indonesia and the slide in copper prices have analyst Curt Woodworth cutting his price target on FCX from $45 to $43, but he maintains his Buy rating as both issues look to be in the rear-view mirror. He expects a resolution to Indonesia's export, tax, oil & gas execution, and a near-term bottoming in copper prices. Another catalyst is progress on asset monetization.

Oil companies bid big bucks for Gulf of Mexico drilling rights
Oil and gas companies pledged ~$872M for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico during today's high-stakes auction that demonstrated plenty of enthusiasm for offshore development in both shallow and deep water.BP, which had been forced to sit out the last three auctions under a government contract suspension, won 24 of its 31 bids for drilling leases in the central Gulf, including territory near its failed Macondo well.The highest single bid came from Freeport McMoRan (FCX), which pledged $69M and beat out five other companies for the rights to drill a tract in the Atwater Valley leasing area, home to at least five discoveries.FCX won 16 of its 17 bids with a $321M price tag, more than three times as much as the next-biggest spender, Chevron (CVX), which scored $103M in high bids; Murphy Oil (MUR) was no. 3 with 16 bids totaling nearly $50M.Cobalt Energy (CIE) was the most aggressive bidder, winning 44 of 46 offers worth $26M.

Chinese copper demand to grow for over a decade, Freeport exec says
China's copper consumption will grow for more than a decade as demand from the world's top user of the metal remains robust despite fears of an economic slowdown, a top executive at Freeport McMoRan (FCX) says.Worries over slower growth in China, which accounts for 40% of global copper consumption, helped send prices to a 44-month low last week, down 12% YTD.China's import volumes should remain brisk even if its GDP expansion slows to 3%-4%, while a recovery in the U.S. and European economies also should support copper consumption, FCX believes.

Indonesia's next leader seen unlikely to ease tough mineral export rules
Indonesia's next president is unlikely to make major changes to the country's controversial mining rules that have frustrated Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and Newmont Mining (NEM), as the top political parties tell Reuters they support the current government's moves to ban mineral exports and tax concentrate shipments aimed at forcing miners to build smelters in Indonesia.Opinion polls show the party of the most popular presidential contender fully supports the new mining laws and apparently would not significantly revise them; the two most likely challengers hold similar opinions.FCX has cut copper output by 60% in the country due to a prolonged dispute over the export tax imposed by the current president, who is barred from running for a third term.

Freeport Indonesia said to cut output by 60%
Freeport McMoRan (FCX) has cut ore production by ~60% at its Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, according to a union official, two months after exports were halted over a dispute with the government on a new tax.FCX and fellow U.S. miner Newmont Mining (NEM) have been locked in talks with the government for weeks over the controversial export tax on mineral concentrates, which rises from 25% this year to as high as 60% by H2 2016.

Global miners weighed by weak Chinese trade data
Mining shares, highly sensitive to Chinese demand, are weak in premarket trade after Chinese exports last month slumped 18% from a year ago, in contrast to the 5% increase that was expected by economists.Although the sharp drop raised concerns over Asia's largest economy, distortions due to the long Lunar New Year holidays could have contributed to the surprise fall.CLF -2.1%, BHP -1.9%, RIO -1.9%, FCX -1.3%, AA -1.3% premarket.

Copper prices post biggest drop in more than two years on China concerns
Copper futures slumped to their biggest loss in more than two years as investors worried about slowing growth in China, which accounts for 40% of the world's copper demand.Traders were spooked by China's first default on a bond traded in the mainland, which comes amid broader fears about the impact of China's economic slowdown on demand for industrial metals.Copper prices have lost 9.2% YTD as signs of faltering growth in China have raised the outlook for a surplus.Top publicly traded producer Freeport McMoRan (FCX) -4.8%.ETFs: JJC, CPER, CUPM Mar. 7, 2014, 2:34 PM | 3 Comments
Freeport, Glencore cope with Congo power shortage
Freeport McMoRan (FCX) says power rationing in the Democratic Republic of Congo will not affect its operations in the short term but a reliable energy supply would be crucial for any future expansion plans.The Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa’s biggest copper producer, has told miners it will institute an electricity rationing program and its state-owned power company will stop signing new contracts.Glencore Xstrata’s (GLCNF, GLNCY) Mutanda and Katanga mining projects and FCX's Tenke Fungurume mine are Congo’s top copper producers; Katanga is scheduled to expand production to almost 300K metric tons by year-end, and Tenke plans to add a second sulfuric acid plant by 2016.

Indonesia may cut mineral concentrate export duty, minister says
Indonesia is considering reducing its export duty on mineral concentrates, the Deputy Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources said Sunday, in a sign Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and Newmont Mining (NEM) may be winning their standoff with the country over the controversial tax.Freeport Indonesia top exec Rozik Soetjipto says he would welcome a cut in the export duty but declines to say if the company would be willing to pay a reduced tax.FCX and NEM have refused to pay an export tax on mineral concentrates imposed in January, which rises from 25% this year to up to 60% by 2016; the dispute over the new rules has halted ~$500M worth of monthly mineral ore and concentrate exports.

Freeport says Indonesian unit may need to declare force majeure
Freeport McMoRan (FCX) says its Indonesian unit may need to declare force majeure on copper concentrate sales if a dispute with the government over export taxes drags on, according to a 10-K filing.Executives from FCX and Newmont Mining (NEM), which together produce virtually all of Indonesia's copper, have been in talks with the government for weeks over the tax; a breakthrough appeared to have been reached earlier this week, when Indonesia indicated it was ready to ease the export tax on firms that proved they were serious about building smelters in the country.Milling at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia averaged ~112K metric tons/day since mid-January, about half the normal rate, FCX says.FCX -0.8% premarket.

Rusal CEO says mineral export ban will benefit Indonesia
The world's largest aluminum producer, Rusal, says it accepts Indonesia's controversial move to restrict the export of mineral ores and will build a refinery to comply with the country's new laws.The laws have raised concerns among global miners, but Rusal CEO Oleg Deripaska says Indonesia's stable economy enables the country to make the transition from mining to higher value processing.Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and Newmont Mining (NEM) say the obligation to process copper with higher purity levels is economically unfeasible and see the export tax on copper concentrates as in breach of their contracts with the government.

UN sends more troops to Congo's copper-producing Katanga province
The UN is sending extra troops to the copper producing Katanga province in Congo in an attempt to quell a growing insurgency that has threatened the province's mining sector.Congo's copper production hit a record high of 900K metric tons last year, but recent violence is threatening the industry, where such companies as Freeport McMoRan (FCX), Glencore Xstrata (GLCNF, GLNCY) and Ivanplats are operating multibillion-dollar copper and cobalt mines.Katanga is believed to hold at least 10% of the world's copper deposits and a third of global cobalt deposits.

Indonesia to ease export tax in first rollback of mining rules
In a potential victory for Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and Newmont Mining (NEM), Indonesia says it will ease the controversial tax on mineral concentrate exports for firms that build smelters in the country, in an apparent partial rollback of new rules that have caused the country's mining industry to grind to a halt.FCX is expected to resume exports of copper concentrate in the "near future," Indonesia's industry minister says; the company also confirms that it will build a copper smelter in the country.

Freeport to defend itself against Indonesia tax, but "positive" about resolution
Freeport McMoRan (FCX -1.6%) CEO Richard Adkerson tells analysts in its Q4 earnings call that it will "defend its rights" in Indonesia against a new export tax he says contravenes its agreement with the government, but the company feels "positive" about getting the matter resolved.FCX says it will defer production of ~40M lbs. of copper and 80K oz. of gold per month until the issue was resolved.Adkerson says FCX is seeing "relatively improved" near-term fundamentals for copper globally and that long-term fundamentals for copper are strong.Sees copper sales steadily rising during through 2016, from 4.1B in 2013 to 4.4B in 2014, 5B in 2015 and 5.7B in 2016; sees gold sales growing in 2014 to 1.7M oz. from 1.2M oz. in 2013.Says Gulf of Mexico asset sale postponed indefinitely but working on other asset sales and a potential MLP opportunity.

Goldman eyes lower iron ore and copper prices, miners fall
Mining stocks are having a rough ride today as the pace of growth slows in China's GDP and industrial production, and Goldman Sachs comes out bearish on copper and iron ore prices.Proclaiming "the sunset of the Iron Age starts in 2014," Goldman believes the steel intensity of the Chinese economy will be on a downward trend from 2014 onwards following a decade where steel production growth outpaced GDP growth.Some indicators already point to lower rates of steel production growth, the firm says; Chinese steel-making capacity is near its peak, and a greater focus on environmental regulations is driving the closure of an increasing number of blast furnaces.Goldman expects Iron ore to fall to $108/ton in 2014 and $80/ton in 2015.CLF -6.1%, RIO -3.2%, VALE -4%, FCX -1.9%, BHP -1.6%.

New copper tax clouds Freeport McMoRan's outlook in Indonesia

Freeport downgraded at FBR as MLP upside potential now seems limited
It's time to take profits in Freeport McMoRan (FCX +0.2%) after a strong six-month run, FBR Capital says in downgrading shares to Market Perform from Outperform.While investors are excited at the possibility of an MLP of FCX's California oil and gas assets, the firm believes proceeds ($5.3B-$6B) may not be enough to support expanded valuation and giving up diversified exposure, which was one of the rationales for the acquisition of the assets.FBR sees Southern Copper (SCCO +2.1%) as a better bet now; it thinks most of the production growth/dividend cut risk now has been priced in, valuation has become more attractive, and SCCO should restart work on its troubled Tia Maria project by March.

Indonesia bans ore exports but miners can still export concentrates
Indonesia clarifies its mineral export ban, closing the door on the export of ores but allowing the export of six forms of concentrate that will permit some of the country's biggest foreign miners to continue operations.The finance minister says miners can pay special taxes to be able to export copper, iron ore, manganese, lead, zinc and ilmenite for the next three years as long as they meet minimum purity levels, meaning Freeport McMoRan (FCX -0.7%) and Newmont Mining (NEM -0.6%) can continue to export from their huge copper mines in the country but with a 20% tax.

Rio Tinto coal mine draws three bids but all disappoint
Rio Tinto (RIO) has received three bids for its majority stake in the Clermont mine in Australia's Queensland state, but all three fell short of expectations, WSJ reports.Rio is cutting costs and seeking to sell assets including coal stakes in Australia and Mozambique and an iron ore mine in Canada, but coal assets have been hard to sell due to easing demand from China, which has resulted in a slump in coal prices.Clermont is one of Rio's newest and largest coal operations; it was opened in 2010 and will supply up to 165M tons of thermal coal in its expected 16-year lifetime.RIO -2.7% premarket, as mining firms are under pressure after economic data from China came in weaker than expected: VALE -2.2%, BHP -1.4%, FCX -0.9%.

Barclays: Freeport McMoRan should convert to an MLP
Freeport McMoRan (FCX +1.1%) sports a solid gain as Barclays analyst David Gagliano suggests the company should covert to an MLP, an idea discussed at length recently with CEO Jim Flores."With producing oil assets backed by hedges, with longer-term U.S.-based copper projects in need of creative financing, and with the stated objective of reducing debt to a targeted level of ~$12B over the next three years, the case for an MLP with sizeable future drop-down potential from FCX is compelling," Gagliano writes.FCX is the firm's top pick among U.S. metals and mining, citing "significantly underappreciated company-specific volume growth potential in both copper and energy."

Miner cost cutting to continue, Cowen Says
Big miners are rallying today as China’s economy shows signs of life but Cowen analysts warn it would be foolish for investors to assume that commodity prices will soar back to their previous levels, if only because mining companies have been cutting costs as if they expect prices will stay low.The rush to cut costs has been felt the hardest by mining-industry suppliers, including Caterpillar (CAT -0.1%) and Joy Global (JOY +0.9%), Cowen says, because cancelling orders for new equipment is one of the easiest ways to cut costs.Among S&P 500 mining stocks, FCX +2.9%, CNX +2.6%, NEM -0.2%.

Freeport Indonesia lifts force majeure at Grasberg copper mine
The Indonesian unit of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX +3.1%) has lifted its force majeure at the Grasberg mine, the world's second-biggest copper mine, almost four months after a deadly accident forced a halt in operations, the local CEO says.Copper prices are rallying today, up 2.2%, fueled by a trifecta of stronger manufacturing data from China, Europe and the U.S.Copper prices have been trending upward since June, but Paul Ausick notes production is estimated to be 167K metric tons above demand this year and rising to 408K metric tons of excess production next year, which makes virtually certain a drop in price with the only question the size of the drop.

BHP Billiton bullish on copper business, bleh on copper prices
BHP Billiton (BHP) is betting strong returns from its copper business, even though copper prices are unlikely to rise in the near term, CEO Andrew Mackenzie says in an interview today. The China shift to a consumer-led economy from a construction-led economy will reduce demand, but it might not be as bad as had been thought. "I don't like to comment on prices, but we have to prepare for a copper outlook around the current price, or perhaps a bit lower, that is around $3 per pound," he says.

Copper prices could trade lower next year in an uncertain economic outlook, but the consensus among metals traders and mining execs is that the move is more likely to be a grind than a collapse as supplies remain tight.

Freeport-McMoRan (FCX -4.8%) CEO Richard Adkerson sees big Chinese demand boosting copper, and to that end FCX will increase its capex budget to $4.3B in 2012 and $4.2B in 2013 from $2.5B last year. Since the world's top 10 copper mines combined produce only ~5M tons/year, handling increased demand would require "significant investment" in new reserves.

Chinese May copper imports drop to a 30 month low, 47% below a year ago and 7% below April, as fabricators choose to draw down inventories instead of bringing in higher priced product. Given the PBOC's monetary tightening, analysts hedge expectations of the usual 2nd half rebound.

Feeling their oats given strong copper prices, powerful demand, and high stock valuations, Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Xstrata (XSRAF.PK) are on the lookout for acquisitions. While FCX is only interested in a large deal, Xstrata is focused on smaller, developing situations.

The head of Xstrata's (XSRAY.PK) copper's business brushes aside concern about the metal, saying the recent buildup in stocks will soon end.

The steady rise in copper prices has been a boon to Freeport McMoRan (FCX +0.3%), but the benefit could be mitigated if manufacturers choose to substitute aluminum for copper to cut costs - as is starting to happen, according to Trefis Team. Aluminum is seen as a feasible substitute if copper crosses $3.50/pound; it's now ~$4.60, up 250% in two years.

Copper has ridden post-quake optimism back towards its mid-February all-time highs, yet stockpiles at the LME are 5X what they were in 2008, at the peak of the last copper frenzy. Also, worrisome is recent slowing in Chinese imports, which may not necessarily be due to the Lunar New Year. JJC +2.8%. COPX +3.4%. Mar. 23, 2011, 4:47 PM | 2 Comments
