Wal-Mart fires a shot across retail on pricing
Grocery store stocks are lower after Reuters reports that Wal-Mart (WMT -1%) is running a pricing test in 1,200 U.S. stores. The company is reportedly putting pressure on consumer packaged goods suppliers in order to protect margins.Consumer names such as Procter & Gamble (PG -0.7%), Church & Dwight (CHD -0.4%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL -1%), Seneca Foods (SENEB), General Mills (GIS -2.3%), Kellogg (K -1.5%) and Kimberly Clark (KMB -0.9%) are all modestly lower on the day.Seeking Alpha gave a heads-up to grocery store investors last week on the WMT development, but the rest of the market seems to be just catching up today. Kroger (NYSE:KR) -3.36%. Smart & Final Stores (NYSE:SFS) -2.42%. Weis Markets (NYSE:WMK) -2.75%. Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) -2.00%. Village Super Market (NASDAQ:VLGEA) -1.82%. Supervalu (NYSE:SVU) -1.15%.Target (NYSE:TGT) is still in positive territory with a 0.15% gain, but could also feel an impact from Wal-Mart pricing initiative. Look for that question on the Target earnings call tomorrow.A prolonged effort by Wal-Main to gain market share through basement pricing could create even more ripples in the retail sector and give Amazon (AMZN +0.8%) something to think about.Retail ETFs: XLY, XRT, VCR, RTH, RETL, IYK, FXD, FDIS, RCD, PMR, UGE, SZK, CNDF, FTXD, JHMC.

Susquehanna previews earnings for KHC, THS, MNST, and K
Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic issues an earnings preview on four food stocks ahead of their reports.Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC): "We are taking our estimates ahead of the 2Q print as in hindsight our assumption for “only” $159M yoy EBITDA growth seems too conservative (consensus assumes +$328M yoy growth), and now expect $350M in EBITDA yoy growth. So our 2Q EPS is now 80c vs. 69c before (consensus is at 73c)."TreeHouse Foods (NYSE:THS): "We are 2c below consensus for 2Q16 (52c vs. 54c and guidance of 50-55c), and our full year EPS of $3.05 is below consensus of $3.07 and guidance of $3.05-$3.10. But we think the risks are more to the upside than downside, especially keeping in mind that 2Q guidance gave management a significant buffer (guidance implies 2H16 EPs being 2x 1H16)."Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST): "Our 97c 2Q estimate is 6c below consensus, with 4c of the projected miss being top line related. According to the scanner data, Monster brands sales in the US continue to decelerate (+7% in 2Q16, 10% in 1Q16 and 4Q15, and low-teens 1Q-3Q15), and this should hurt sentiment."Kellogg (NYSE:K): "Although we project sales to decline at a worse pace in 2Q than 1Q, the stock may trade up as we see a 4c beat (1c on sales, 1c on EBIT margins), with sales slightly ahead of consensus, and good quality margin trends (accelerated gross margin gains, with greater reinvestment on turnaround efforts). We model 95c vs. consensus 91c."Zuanic has KHC and THS rated at Positive, while K and MNST are set at Neutral. Aug. 3, 2016, 8:46 AM | 1 Comment

Congress halfway to passing GMO labeling bill
A bill requiring food companies to label GMO ingredients was approved by the U.S. Senate by a 63 to 30 vote and now heads to the House of Representatives.The negotiated bill requires food companies to label genetically modified food by a phrase, symbol on the package, or a bar code that can be scanned by smartphones.The Department of agriculture still has two years to write the precise labeling rules if the House approves the bill.The passage of the bill is seen as a positive for the food sector as the alternative of having to adhere to state-by-state rules could create operational chaos for national sellers.Food stocks: SENEA, SENEB, THS, OTCPK:NCRA, CPB, MDLZ, GIS, OTCPK:NSRGY,  FLO, CAG, DF, SJM,DF, ANFI, JJSF, WWAV, UL, OTCQX:DANOY, OTCPK:PLATF, POST, K, PEP, DMND, PF, HAIN, KO, BETR, KHC, WILC, PPC, PF, LWAY, HRL, TSN, DTEA, SAFM, BRID.

Plant-based hamburger startup creates some interesting sizzle
Impossible Foods aims to disrupt the food industry by developing meat products from plant-based ingredients. Launched by a top biochemist from Stanford, the startup says it's on the verge of offering meat lovers an alternative that looks, smells, and even sizzles (video) like regular ground beef.Science timeout: Impossible honed in on a molecule called heme that catalyzes the flavors in meat. A legume-derived heme-containing protein is put to the task of creating the meat taste that even top chefs have raved about.The first Impossible Burgers are expected to be launched this year in the U.S.Notable names are taking in an interest in the concept. During the last venture capital round, Impossible brought in fresh funds from Bill Gates and Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Former Nest/Google exec Tony Fadell is also an angel investor. Impossible Foods CEO Patrick Brown confirmed at Recode's Code conference that the company turned down an offer from Google (pre-Alphabet split) for somewhere between $200M and $300M.If the startup were to ramp up at scale, the development might be something to watch for meat giants such as Cargill, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), JBS (OTC:JBSAF), and National Beef Packaging Company (NYSE:LUK). Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) are already active in the frozen veggie burger category, while Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) has been dabbling with indie brands. There's also an interesting tie-in with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) looking to appeal to millennials and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) working on developing a "better burger" concept.

Food and beverage giants prep for new day
Iconic food and beverage brands continue to grow out of favor with U.S. consumers, according to a new report from Rabobank.Many Q1 earnings reports tipped off weakness at well-known F&B brands.The bank notes that the increasing purchase power of the millennial generation is a major factor in the shift as e-commerce accounts for a higher mix of purchasing.A willingness of major retail chains such as Target (NYSE:TGT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) to attempt to differentiate themselves with new concepts and products has also contributed to well-known brands slipping.Rabobank thinks major food and beverage players can still show strong growth rates if they are nimble with their strategy and use M&A wisely to catch fresh brands on the upswing.Related stocks: K, GIS, CPB, MDLZ, PEP, KO, HSY, SJM, DPS, KRFT, OTCPK:NSRGY, OTCPK:NSRGF.

A win for Dish and consumers, a loss for programmers
Dish Networks (DISH -0.2%) won a significant court battle in L.A. against Fox Broadcasting over the company's Dish Anywhere app.The ruling from a federal judge applied some of the principles from the Supreme Court's look at the Aereo case.The opinion from the court indicated that watching content on mobile devices and tablets through Dish Anywhere doesn't qualify as a breach of copyright law.The use of Dish's PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop features were also deemed as fair use.Many programmers seemed to have anticipated the legal decision and already negotiated with Dish to disable ad-skipping for a period of time after a show airs.The ruling is sure to have been noticed on Madison Avenue where the largest (and smarter?) ad spenders continue to increase digital spending over broadcast/cable TV buys.Big advertisers: MCD, PG, BUD, WMT, TGT, K, GIS, TM, GM.Programmers: CBS, TWX, FOXA, SNI, AMCX, VIA , VIAB, DISCA.

Soggy days for the cereal industry
The cereal industry is undergoing a "death by a thousand cuts" with no single competing category or product delivering a knockout blow - but volume in the U.S. remaining stuck in a downward trend.Though Greek yogurt, the smoothie craze, fad diets, and the explosion of organic brands are all major headaches for cereal sellers, it might be the ambivalent attitude of millennials that proves to be the biggest challenge.A recent swing by Kellogg (NYSE:K), Post Holdings (NYSE:POST), and General Mills (NYSE:GIS) to wax nostalgic with marketing campaigns hasn't delivered as strong as results as anticipated and new product innovation (protein, gluten-free, no-fat) has been somewhat hit and miss.The battle for breakfast: An aggressive push by fast-food and fast-casual restaurants as well as the appeal of hit-and-run breakfasts from convenience-store chains has also impacted cereal sales, according to analysts.

The battle for the 12 minutes of breakfast
Data from NPD Group indicates the average American spends 12 minutes a day on breakfast.The highly-contested daypart pits major cereal sellers such as Kellogg (K), Post Holding (POST), and General Mills (GIS) against fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Taco Bell (YUM), and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN).Convenience-store chains are also a major factor as C-stores such as Circle K (ANCUF), 7-11, Pantry (PTRY), BP Connect (BP), On the Run (XOM), Speedway America (MPC), Kwik Shop (KR), and Qwiktrip continue to innovate and show some positive growth trends.What to watch: Analysis from Edward D. Jones suggests consumers tend to stay with their routines. The read is that companies in the breakfast business need to compete for market share within their segment - instead of trying to change consumer behavior. Taco Bell is utilizing that strategy with its marketing message which paints McDonald's as old-fashioned. Jun. 9, 2014, 1:46 PM | 6 Comments

FDA gives thumbs up to new sugar substitute
The U.S. regulator approves advantame, the sixth sugar substitute to get the agency's blessing. It can used as a tabletop sweetener or as an ingredient in cooking by virtue of its stability at high temperatures.The approval was based on the results of 37 animal and human studies submitted by the manufacturer.Advantame is chemically similar to aspartame (Equal). People with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria have difficulty metabolizing phenylalanine, a component of both aspartame and advantame. Food containing aspartame must be labeled as such. The amount of advantame needed to achieve a similar level of sweetness as aspartame is much less so no special labeling will be required.The last sweetener cleared by the FDA was neotame (Newtame) in 2002.Just a few related tickers: (PG) (PEP) (KO) (GIS) (K) May 20, 2014, 7:15 PM | 9 Comments

Will food companies sweat organic push from Bentonville?
Wal-Mart's (WMT) plan to sell Wild Oats-branded organic food could catch the eye of food companies with a paranoid sense over the retail giant's scale.Organic food only accounts for 4% of total food sales in the U.S., but provides a strong pace of growth and healthy margins.

Companies face junk-food taxes in Mexico
Major international food and beverage companies are concerned about Mexico's plans to impose taxes on junk food and sugary drinks.Last week, Mexico's lower house of Congress authorized a 5% levy on high-calorie packaged food such as peanut butter. The chamber has also passed legislation to tax sugary drinks at 1 peso (8 U.S. cents) per liter.The taxes could pose a big challenge to the food companies, especially if Mexico is successful in its aim of changing diets in the country - where 7/10 adults and 1/3 children are overweight or obese - and is copied by other nations.Companies that are set to be affected include Coca-Cola (KO), Kellogg (K), PepsiCo (PEP), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Nestle (NSRGY.PK).ETFs: XLP, VDC, FXG, IYK, PSL, RHS, PSCC, UGE, SZK Oct. 20, 2013, 4:14 AM | 10 Comments

Private label brand breakthrough: A survey released by Deloitte on brand loyalty could rattle the food and grocery sectors as a whopping 94% of consumers indicate they will stick with private-label or store brands instead of reverting back to costlier options. Industry insiders think even if the economy comes roaring back, a paradigm shift  of consumer attitudes toward food purchases may already be entrenched. The trend could favor Treehouse Foods (THS), Safeway (SWY), Kroger (KR), Costco (COST), Whole Foods Market (WFM) - while creating a headache for Kellogg (K), Post Holdings (POST), Campbell Soup (CPB), Kraft Foods (KRFT), and General Mills (GIS).

Commodity input costs for food companies could be lower in Q2 if the trend of lower prices on corn, wheat, and soybean sustains. What to watch: Though the sector is getting tagged as overbought and the Heinz premium hanging over it could wear out, improving margins might be enough to take General Mills (GIS -1.4%), Kellogg (K -0.8%), J.M. Smucker (SJM -0.3%), and Campbell Soup (CPB +0.4%) to even greater heights this year.

Big trouble in the cereal market? Shares of Post Holdings (POST -0.4%) and Kellogg (K -0.5%) both take on a little water after Goldman Sachs downgrades sector peer General Mills (GIS -2.3%) to Sell.

After execs with ConAgra made it perfectly clear on a conference call earlier (wrapup) that the allure in buying Ralcorp Holdings is to try to dominate the market for private label foods, the next question for the sector is how far can the food giant go. The company can add distribution channels at outlets such as Costco (COST +0.7%) and Whole Foods Market (WFM -0.9%), while also making private label products for huge accounts like Wal-Mart, McDonald's, and Kroger. Are Kellogg (K +0.5%), Kraft (KRFT +1%), and General Mills (GIS +0.7%) in any trouble or will the formidable marketing clout of the packaged food companies beat back the challenge?

Fears that the U.S. drought will drive up food prices next year are mostly unfounded, WSJ's Josh Mitchell writes, calculating the average consumer will spend only an extra $2.73/month. Food accounts for only ~14% of consumers’ daily living expenses, and given that prices for other items are falling or subdued, overall inflation likely will remain muted.

Food price increases resulting from the Midwest drought that ravaged crops might not be as steep as some expect, according to some analysis. Fruit and vegetables crops are relatively stable due to irrigation, while corn ingredients typically only make up a a small portion of many common packaged food items. For the time being beef and milk prices could actually dip as farmers sell off cattle that they can't feed effectively, though next year consumers could take the hit when the dwindling number of cattle directly affects beef and dairy prices.

Today's selloff comes as no surprise to Forbes contributor Panos Mourdoukoutas. He's noticed a number of warning signs: A slowing global economy and investor complacency over political gridlock for starters. More interestingly, he points out that companies such as Proctor & Gamble (PG -0.1%) and Kellogg (K -0.7%) are unable to pass on material costs for essential items. As production costs continue to rise, they should be able to offset the increase by raising prices, but can't. As we all know, in a consumption-driven economy like ours, a weak consumer spells disaster.

The biggest U.S. food companies try to head off stricter regulation by voluntarily cutting back on marketing unhealthy foods to children.
