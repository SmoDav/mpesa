Utilities shares enjoy strongest week since September
Utilities shares are on track for their best week since September, as investors speculate that Pres. Trump's planned infrastructure program may take much longer than expected.The upward momentum has come as the “outlook for U.S. fiscal stimulus has diminished,” says Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI. “The S&P continues to rise, but the change in market leadership suggests investors’ growth expectations have weakened."The utilities sector was the S&P's second-best performer leading up to the Nov. 8 election as the Fed held back on interest rate increases, but utilities have since climbed only 3.8% vs. a 10.1% gain for the S&P as investors have bet that Trump’s planned infrastructure spending and corporate tax rate cuts would stoke higher levels of inflation.So far this week: DUK +5.2%, NEE +2.8%, SO +2.9%, D +4.8%, AEP +4.9%, PCG +4.3%, PPL +3.3%, ED +2.5%, SRE +4.3%, EXC +4.2%, NRG +5%, DYN +2.9%, CPN +2%.ETFs: XLU, UTG, IDU, VPU, GUT, BUI, FUTY, RYU, UPW, FXU, SDP Fri, Feb. 24, 10:59 AM | 18 Comments
Dominion Resources -3% as it warns of lower earnings in 2017
Dominion Resources (NYSE:D) -2.8% premarket after missing Q4 earnings and revenue estimates and saying earnings could fall this year, hurt by import contract revenue at its Cove Point Terminal in Maryland and other causes.Dominion forecasts FY 2017 EPS of $3.40-$3.90, compared with 2016 operating earnings of $3.80/share in 2016 and $3.78 consensus analyst estimates; for Q1, it sees EPS of $0.90-$1.10, vs. $1.07 consensus.The company says results this year will be hurt by lower revenue from import contracts at Cove Point, a refueling outage and lower hedged power prices at its Millstone power station in Connecticut, and a "step down" in solar investment tax credits.

End of U.S. nuclear industry seen without help from subsidies, Carlyle says
Nuclear power will come to an end in the U.S. if the industry fails to obtain more government support, Carlyle Group predicts.U.S. nuclear reactors need more subsidies to keep running, such as a federal carbon tax that would reward them for their zero-emissions power, according to Bob Mancini, co-head of Carlyle's power unit.Mancini points to measures approved in New York as an example of the kind of help nuclear power plant owners will need to survive; in August, NY state regulators cleared ~$500M/year in subsidies as part of a clean energy plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Relevant tickers include EXC, ETR, DUK, D, NEE, SO, PCG, ED, EIX, AEP, PPL, DTE, FE, NRG, PNM, POR, SCG, WR, XEL, LNT, GE, URA, NLR Oct. 26, 2016, 1:22 PM | 48 Comments
U.S. nuclear power generation hits 10-year seasonal low
The amount of electricity generated by U.S. nuclear reactors hit its lowest seasonal level since 2006, held down by malfunctions and closures tied to Hurricane Matthew as well as routine maintenance.The outages mean natural gas use by generators likely will rise as grid operators rush to replace lost supplies at a time of unseasonably warm temperatures, which could boost power prices.Among the plants shuttered was Dominion's (NYSE:D) Surry 2 nuclear power plant in Virginia, which closed due to a system error, and NextEra Energy's (NYSE:NEE) St. Lucie 2 reactor in Florida, which went offline as a safety measure ahead of the hurricane.The closures come as 23 nuclear units, accounting for ~23% of total U.S. capacity, are scheduled to close to replace spent fuel rods in the three months through November.ETFs: XLU, UTG, IDU, VPU, GUT, BUI, FUTY, RYU, UPW, FXU, SDP

Utility shares still look pricey even after longest losing streak since 2002
Utilities shares (NYSEARCA:XLU) fell today for the ninth straight session, marking their longest losing streak since 2002 and deepening the recent slide in income producing investments as investors warily watch central banks and interest rates.The S&P Utilities sector has dropped 7.5% in the nine days, including a 0.3% fall today, trimming its YTD gain to 8.9%; during the period, AES -10%, EXC -8.8%, PPL -8.8%, PCG -8.2%, ED -8%, EIX -7.6%, SO -7.4%, NEE -7.4%, SRE -7.1%, AEP -6.8%, D -6.7%, DUK -6.5%.“Trees don’t grow to the sky,” says Fred Alger's Management's Brad Neuman, “It was almost like the market was waiting for an excuse” to send high-yielding stocks back toward their historical valuations, adding that such stocks could have further to fall.Even after the recent decline in share prices, utilities had a 12-month trailing P/E ratio of 21.4 as of Tuesday, vs. 19.8 for the S&P; at the beginning of the year, utilities had a lower ratio than the broader market.

Duke Energy to sell slice of Atlantic Coast Pipeline to Dominion
Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) confirms it will sell some if its ownership stake in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to Dominion Resources (NYSE:D) on Monday, when it closes its $4.9B acquisition of Piedmont Natural Resources.The proposed deal cleared its final hurdle yesterday when the North Carolina Utilities Commission approved the transaction.DUK has owned 40% of the proposed 600-mile pipeline, but under the deal that formed the joint venture in 2014, Dominion must be the largest owner; the original ownership breakdown was D with 45%, DUK with 40%, PNY at 10% and AGL Resources, which has since been bought by Southern Co., with 5%.Dominion says it will follow through with a previously announced plan to purchase a 3% stake from DUK, which will then give it 48% of the project and DUK 47%.

Dominion target raised at Barclays as ACP delayed but cash flow thesis intact
Dominion Resources (D -0.4%) is maintained with an Outperform rating but with an $84 price target, raised from $80, and improved 2019 and 2020 earnings estimates at Barclays, reflecting an updated projected in-service date for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.Dominion now expects the pipeline to begin commercial operation in Q4 2019, a year later than original guidance, after ACP was forced to devise an alternate route to satisfy government concerns raised by the U.S. Forest Service, adding to an already an extensive FERC review process.The company has said it expects construction to begin in Q3 2017, which Barclays believes still is overly optimistic and says it always had anticipated a delay at least to mid-2019.The firm notes Dominion has indicated that it might increase the dividend growth rate to more than 8%/year starting in 2018.

Dominion downgraded at Morgan Stanley on VEPCO outlook
Dominion Resources (D -0.4%) is downgraded to Equal Weight from Overweight with a $79 price target, trimmed from $82, at Morgan Stanley, which says shares are fairly valued on a more balanced risk/reward outlook.Stanley says the primary drivers its downgrade are anticipated lower sales growth at the VEPCO regulated utility in light of recent data points, and lower commodity prices impacting profitability at the Millstone nuclear plant.The firm adds that Dominion and Dominion Midstream Partners (DM +1.5%) are well positioned to benefit in the longer term from secular demand growth for Appalachian gas production, driven by favorable positioning in the Marcellus/Utica region.

Brexit means big gains for top utilities stocks
One of the biggest Brexit beneficiaries is the utilities sector, as the Dow Jones Utility Average and the SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF both surged to new record highs as Treasury yields tumble to multiyear lows.The implied annual dividend yield for the Dow utilities is 3.08% and 3.18% for the utilities ETF, more than double the 10-year Treasury yield.J.P. Morgan equity strategists said today that they believe bond yields "are not going anywhere but lower,” and thus remain overweight on the utilities sector.At least six Dow utilities components posted record closes: NEE +3.3%, EIX +2.5%, AWK +2.4%, ED +1.9%, AEP +1.8%, PCG +0.8%.Among other major utilities in today's trade: SO +1.9%, DUK +1.9%, SCG +1.6%, ETR +1.1%, D +1%, AEE +1%, XEL +0.9%, SRE +0.9%, PEG +0.7%, FE +0.7%, EXC +0.6%.ETFs: XLU, UTG, IDU, VPU, GUT, BUI, FUTY, RYU, UPW, FXU, PUI, SDP, PSCU Jun. 27, 2016, 7:27 PM | 36 Comments
Dominion "running out of steam," downgraded at J.P. Morgan
Dominion Resources (D +0.4%) is downgraded to Neutral from Overweight with an $81 price target at J.P. Morgan, citing lower New England power prices and an earnings pullback in solar ITCs.JPM says New England ATC power prices for 2017 are down 7% YTD and 20% over the last 12 months, worse than most other U.S. regions and pressuring Dominion's Millstone unit in Connecticut despite growing capacity revenues in later years.The firm foresees solar ITCs contributing $0.30-$0.35 to EPS this year but only $0.10-$0.15 next year, and notes that 37M new shares from the 2013-14 mandatory convertible debt offerings will dilute growth through 2017.On the positive side, "the utilities continue to benefit from pipeline integrity programs, above average load growth, new generation and FERC transmission," the firm says.

Exelon to seek 20-year license extension for Peach Bottom nuclear plant
Exelon (EXC -0.6%) says it will ask the NRC to extend the operating life of its Peach Bottom nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania by another 20 years.EXC says an extension would help the state meet its carbon reduction goals under the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan.The two operating reactors at the Peach Bottom plant currently are licensed to operate through 2033 and 2034.Peach Bottom would be among the first U.S. reactors allowed to run longer than 60 years; Dominion Resources (D -0.2%) said last year that it would seek approval to keep its Surry nuclear power plant in Virginia online until it is 80 years old.

Dominion (NYSE:D) says purchase agreements have been signed for 96% of natural gas that would be delivered to the southeastern U.S. by the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline.The company says the utility agreements reflect the need for the nearly 600-mile project planned to deliver fracked natural gas along a route from West Virginia through Virginia and into North Carolina.Dominion, which is partnering with Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and others to build the pipeline, outlined the status of the project during a conference call yesterday; 450 miles of the pipeline’s route has been surveyed, and the project has an in-service date of late 2018.The pipeline enjoys broad political support but has found organized resistance among some landowners and conservation groups concerned about its impact on rural, forested landscapes.

WSJ: Electric utilities opt to skip fight against Obama carbon rules
Electricity producers are largely planning to comply with, not contest, the Obama administration’s new rule limiting carbon emissions from power plants, believing the new regulations at least add certainty to their plans to move away from coal to generate electricity toward cheap natural gas and renewable energy, WSJ reports."Everybody is moving in this direction anyway,” Dominion (NYSE:D) CEO Tom Farrell says."Our coal assets are still running but they’re not making any money," says CEO Bob Flexon of Dynegy (NYSE:DYN), whose generating capacity is ~45% coal and 55% gas. “All the earnings are coming from our gas portfolio."Certainly not every utility has agreed to go along with the EPA’s 15-year plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the power industry by 32% from 2005; among those who say they are still studying the rule and deciding on next steps are DUK, AEP and SO.ETFs: XLU, KOL, UTG, IDU, VPU, GUT, BUI, FUTY, RYU, UPW, FXU, SDP Oct. 12, 2015, 10:56 AM | 40 Comments

Coal companies jump as Supreme Court strikes down EPA mercury rules
Coal stocks (KOL +0.3%) are rallying after the Supreme Court threw out the EPA’s first-ever rules requiring coal-fired power plants to cut emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants, saying the agency should have weighed the cost of compliance in deciding whether to regulate.The ruling means the EPA must go back to the drawing board, which possibly could push any new emissions rules past Pres. Obama’s time in office.Coal companies are enjoying hefty gains: WLT +28.2%, ACI +15.1%, BTU +11.2%, ANR +5.4%, CLD +5.2%, RNO +3.9%, WLB +1.9%, CNX +1.4%.Select utility names also are seeing some strength: AEP +1%, PCG +0.9%, D +0.6%, NEE +0.6%, EXC +0.3%.

FERC approval of PJM power plant reform sends top generators higher
PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. electricity grid, wins approval from U.S. regulators for a plan to increase reliability at power plants and avoid a repeat of the shutdowns and price spikes during the unseasonably cold winter of 2014.Under the plan, which takes effect in 2018 after a capacity auction this year, generators that promise to be available during peak demand periods will receive higher payouts than other plants and will be penalized for failing to meet the commitments; the auction, planned for May, was delayed after FERC declined PJM’s initial proposal and asked for more information.The largest generators in PJM are trading higher at the open: NRG +4.2%, AEP +1.4%, EXC +3.1%, PEG +1.1%, DYN +7.2%.Also: TLN +4%, NEE +1.2%, PCG +0.7%, EE +1.5%, SO +0.5%, D +0.2%, DUK +0.9%, XLU +0.9%.

Environmentalist groups sue to block Cove Point LNG export project
Opponents of Dominion's (NYSE:D) Cove point liquefied natural gas export facility file an appeal in federal court to halt construction until it can hear their case against the project's approval.In a motion filed Monday with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for three environmental groups say residents in the area of the terminal already are suffering from dust, noise and heavy truck traffic with preliminary construction activity.Dominion has said it expects to finish work on the $3.8B project by 2017 and begin liquefying natural gas piped to the site; Cove Point won final authorization last month from the U.S. Energy Department to export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries.

Norway's oil fund to quit coal investments
Norway’s $900B sovereign wealth fund - the world’s biggest - will drop its holdings in companies and utilities that have heavy exposure to coal, according to a deal reached in the parliament that calls for the fund to exit companies with more than 30% of their revenue from coal.By excluding coal companies, the fund joins a growing divestment movement targeting fossil fuels.The fund previously exited companies that produce tobacco, nuclear weapons, cluster bombs and land mines. The Norwegian fund has stakes in a number of major utilities, including Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), Dominion Resources (NYSE:D), the U.K.'s SSE (OTCPK:SSEZF), Italy's Enel (OTCPK:ENLAY) and Germany’s RWE (OTCPK:RWEOY) and E.ON (OTCQX:EONGY).

Barron's: Utilities stocks look attractive again after pullback
Electric utility stocks look more attractive after a 10%-plus decline since late January, with total annual return potential of 8%-9% in the next few years, according to a Barron's weekend analysis."The relative attraction of utilities has increased in an environment of slower economic growth, when earnings growth is being suppressed by a stronger dollar and energy prices,” Bernstein utilities analyst Hugh Wynne, favoring two California utilities, PG&E (NYSE:PCG) and Edison International (NYSE:EIX), because of above-average growth and a favorable regulatory environment."Utilities and the overall market may provide the same total return, but one offers a lower-risk package,” says Credit Suisse utility analyst Dan Eggers, who is partial to American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) and PG&E.Also discussed: SO, ED, DUK, D.

Dominion rises as Q1 earnings come in at high end of guidance
Dominion Resources (D +0.4%) edges higher after Q1 operating EPS of $0.99 fell from $1.04 a year ago but came in at the high end of its expectation for $0.85-$1 in per-share profit.D attributed the decline mostly to the absence of a gain on asset sales to Blue Racer, which knocked $0.06 off the bottom line, with lower merchant generation margins and a higher effective tax rate as other factors.Dominion Virginia, which provides electric service to ~2.5M customers, was the company’s best performer in Q1, with profit rising to $140M from $131M a year earlier; Dominion Generation was the biggest drag, with profit falling ~9% to $282M.D reaffirmed guidance for FY 2015, seeing EPS of $3.50-$3.85 vs. $3.69 analyst consensus estimate, but issued downside guidance for Q2, seeing operating EPS of $0.65-$0.75 vs. $0.79 consensus.

Atlantic Coast Pipeline path stirs opposition in Virginia, West Virginia
The proposed $5B Atlantic Coast Pipeline that would deliver natural gas to the southeastern U.S. is finding pockets of opposition along its planned path in West Virginia and Virginia, where it would carve through two national forests.To be sure, the pipeline has plenty of supporters, including Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who says the project will boost the state’s economy by attracting new businesses with the promise of abundant and relatively cheap energy supplies.The pipeline being proposed by Dominion Resources (NYSE:D), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and other partners would deliver 1.5B cf/day of natural gas from drilling in the Marcellus and Utica shale deposits.The pipeline requires approval from the FERC and will be reviewed by various state environmental agencies; the companies hope to receive approval by mid-2016 and to start operating the pipeline in 2018.

Cheniere, Exxon are big winners in overhaul of natural gas export reviews
The U.S. Energy Department has finalized its plan to revamp the process for approving liquefied natural gas exports, largely codifying a process first proposed in May.Beginning immediately, the DoE will only issue final rulings on whether exports are in the public interest after the FERC has completed an environmental review of the project.The benefits of the change extend unevenly to the dozens of companies now vying to export U.S. natural gas, and some in the industry say the new process will exacerbate permitting delays for most companies.The biggest winner under the new approach is Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG), which already had gained FERC approval but faced a nearly two-year wait for the required Energy Department review of its proposed Sabine Pass expansion; it now moves to the front of the line to get a permit from the DoE.Another winner is Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) Golden Pass project in southeast Texas, which also was far down the Energy Department’s list, even though it was well into the FERC review.The new policy will not affect companies that already have received conditional approvals, such as Dominion's (NYSE:D) Cove Point project, Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) Cameron LNG project and Leucadia National's (NYSE:LUK) Oregon LNG project.

EPA's McCarthy says significant changes possible in carbon plan
EPA chief Gina McCarthy says she expects for significant changes in proposed state emission goals before a final rule is issued next year if the individual states show they can’t meet the targets.McCarthy says the agency made changes when developing its rules on mercury pollution in 2012 after utilities complained, and says she "wouldn’t be surprised if we made significant” revisions to the carbon proposal.McCarthy notes "confusion" around the targeted 30% emission cuts, saying it’s not a goal of the plan but an estimate of what the EPA thinks can be achieved.Coal names are broadly lower: WLT -4.4%, ACI -3.7%, ANR -2%, ARLP -1.9%, CNX -1.3%, CLD -0.3%, BTU -0.2%.Big utilities are mostly higher: EXC +1.6%, AEP +1%, NRG +0.7%, D +0.5%, XEL +0.4%, SO +0.3%, PEG +0.2%, NEE +0.1%, DUK -0.2% ETFs: XLE, XLU, TAN, ERX, KOL, IDU, VDE, OIH, ERY, FCG, VPU, DIG, KWT, GASL, DUG, IYE, GASX, PXJ, RYE, FENY, UPW, RYU, FUTY, FXN, FXU, DDG, SDP Jun. 3, 2014, 12:45 PM | 6 Comments

U.S. proposes major change to LNG export decision-making process
The Obama administration announces a major overhaul of its review process for approving U.S. liquefied natural gas exportsUnder the proposal, the Department of Energy would no longer issue conditional approvals of projects; instead, the DoE would decide whether an LNG export project is in the national interest only after the FERC had issued a final environmental review.The change to the export process aims to help expedite reviews by focusing only on most commercially viable projects that have finished the FERC process.Related stocks: LNG, CQH, GLNG, SRE, GTLS, TGP, D, GMLP, GLOG, CQP, GLOP, DLNG.

Environmentalists are angry at the Obama administration's scaled-back regulation meant to keep fish from being sucked into the water intakes of factories and power plants.The EPA regulation issued yesterday specified a range of at least seven options facility operators can use to reduce the 2B fish, crab or shrimp that die each year in water intakes, but critics say the agency left too many decisions with state regulators and are threatening to sue to force tougher action.Power companies operating large coal or nuclear plants such as Entergy (ETR), Exelon (EXC), Duke Energy (DUK) and Dominion (D) had urged the EPA to grant flexibility and time to meet the water-intake standards, and generally were satisfied with the outcome.ETFs: XLU, IDU, VPU, UPW, RYU, FUTY, PUI, FXU, SDP, PSCU, UTLT May 20, 2014, 7:15 PM | 39 Comments

White House mulls massive reduction in power emissions
The White House is considering forcing power plants to cut carbon emissions by 25% over a 15-year period, Bloomberg reports.The problem is that owners can only cut so much of a facility's emissions by increasing efficiency, so a lot of the reduction could have to come by "going outside the fence," such as by deepening the use of renewable energy, improving grid efficiency and encouraging customers to use less electricity.Trying to compel operators to rely on such external measures could run afoul of what the government is allowed to do under the Clean Air Act.ETFs: KOL, XLU, IDU, VPU, RYU, PUI, UPW, FXU, SDP, PSCU, FUTY, UTLT Coal Tickers: PCXCQ, BTU, WLT, CNX, ACI, ANR, JRCC, YZC, ARLP, AHGP, NRP, PVR, PVG, PVA, OXF, CLD, WLB, RNO Utilities: ED, POM, PEG, FE, NST, UTL, ETR, EXC, D, NU, PCG, DUK May 16, 2014, 5:03 AM | 126 Comments
Dominion LNG export project clears U.S. environmental review
U.S. regulators say Dominion Resources' (D -0.8%) proposal to export liquefied natural gas from a terminal in Cove Point, Md., would pose “no significant impact” on the environment.The FERC's environmental assessment is a positive step for the company, but the full commission is scheduled to issue a final decision on Cove Point by Aug. 13.Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass is the only U.S. project so far to win approval from the FERC and Energy Department, and Sempra Energy’s proposed Cameron LNG terminal cleared the FERC staff environmental review on April 30.

Rex Energy +3.2% on strong Q1, new gas transportation deals
Rex Energy (REXX +3.2%) says it signed binding agreements with Dominion (D) and Texas Gas Transmission to pipe natural gas from Pennsylvania to the midwest and Gulf coast.The Dominion deal will allow for expanded capacity on ~235 miles of existing pipeline, while the Texas Gas agreement will allow for expanded capacity on ~690 miles of existing pipeline.Northland Capital raises its REXX price target to $28 from $25 following the gas transport deals as well as an impressive Q1 earnings report, as production exceeded the high end of guidance and EBITDA beat the firm's estimate (Briefing.com).Financial terms of the separate deals were not disclosed.

Keystone foes now gunning for Dominion's Cove Point LNG export project
Green groups call on Pres. Obama to reject pending applications to build liquefied natural gas export terminals, and "as a good-faith test case," Obama should force the FERC to conduct a broad environmental impact assessment of Dominion Resources’ (D) proposed Cove Point LNG export facility in Maryland.The energy required to liquefy and ship gas at Cove Point would raise the fuel’s greenhouse gas emissions to the level of coal, activists say, threatening the climate like pipelines tied to developing oil sands in Alberta, such as Keystone XL.The Energy Department already has conditionally approved Dominion to export up to 770M cf/day of natural gas to countries that don’t have free-trade agreements with the U.S., but the FERC still must review the company's plans to revamp its decades-old natural gas receiving terminal so it can instead liquefy the gas and load it onto tankers bound for Japan and India.FERC so far is on track to require only a smaller environmental assessment of the planned $3.8B export project.

NRG to buy Dominion's retail electric business
NRG Energy (NRG +1.7%) agrees to acquire Dominion Resources' (D -0.2%) retail electric business for an undisclosed sum, in a bid to expand its presence in the northeastern U.S. and Texas.Dominion's retail electric business serves more than 600K customers in northern states from Illinois to New York, while its Cirro Energy brand is focused on Texas.NRG has made a steady series of deals to boost its retail power business and its collection of power plants; it became the biggest wholesale electric company in the U.S. last year after it acquired GenOn Energy for ~$1.7B, and it is buying coal plants, wind farms and other assets out of bankruptcy from an Edison International subsidiary.

NiSource link to shale boom enhances deal appeal, Bloomberg says
NiSource (NI +0.7%) is discussed by Bloomberg as a prime acquisition candidate for utility companies seeking to profit from the shale gas boom.NI surged to all-time highs last week amid takeover speculation fueled by a December report that Dominion Resources (D +0.2%) was raising money for a purchase; an all-cash deal would give Dominion complementary gas assets and boost its earnings, even if it paid a 20% premium to NI’s Friday closing price of $33.89, according to Bernstein analysts.NI’s Columbia Pipeline Group operates ~15.7K miles of lines that stretch from Louisiana to New York, as well as gas and electric utilities; analysts say NI's growing pipeline business has appeal, "both fundamentally and to those who could conceivably use financial engineering to extract even greater value."

Credit Suisse picks five favorite utilities stocks for 2014
Credit Suisse suggests investors own utilities boasting good visibility to growth through capital expenditure programs, supportive regulation where the risk of cuts in return on equity is lower, and rate case stay-out protections that lower potential for regulatory intervention; to that end, its favorite utilities into the new year are CMS Energy (CMS), American Electric Power (AEP), NextEra Energy (NEE), Northeast Utilities (NU) and Dominion Resources (D).Elsewhere in the sector, CS cuts EPS estimates for Entergy (ETR) after the utility received an order in Arkansas pointing to a 9.3% ROE vs. 10.4% requested, which will sustain questions about ETR's ability to execute on its growth strategy; the firm also lowers its EPS outlook for Con Ed (ED) after reaching a broad settlement on electric, gas and steam cases with a 9.2% ROE on electric and 9.3% for steam and gas.

Are utilities headed for a death-spiral?
"Subsidies and falling technology costs are making distributed solar power cost-competitive [and] as more people switch to solar, utilities sell less electricity to those customers [causing the] utilities [to] spread their high fixed costs ... over fewer kilowatt-hours, making solar power even more competitive and pushing more people to adopt it," WSJ's Liam Denning notes, describing what is dubbed "the death-spiral thesis" for traditional utilities.Denning says it's the merchant generators (like NRG) that have the most to worry about: "For regulated utilities, the idea that solar panels will enable everyone to leave the grid, making such networks redundant, is overstated."Although the threat may seem distant for now, Denning says it's worth taking seriously if you're an investor. "The gyres may look exceedingly wide, but that spiral is taking shape," he says.Some individual names: Southern Company (SO), Edison International (EIX), Duke Energy (DUK -0.1%), FirstEnergy (FE -0.7%), XCel Energy (XEL +0.2%), American Electric Power (AEP -0.2%), Dominion (D -0.2%), Exelon (EXC +0.5%).

Deutsche Bank talks utilities, adjusts targets
Deutsche Bank is out with some commentary on the utilities going into year-end.Analyst Jonathan Arnold says that with the group "set to finish the year last among sectors for the second straight year, it is surely tempting to argue for a rebound in 2014."Nevertheless, Arnold thinks that "with the Fed exit still [upcoming] and a continuing overhang from challenging power business fundamentals, investors have plenty of reason to proceed with caution."Rundown: ETR cut to Hold from Buy, price target cut to $64 from $70; DUK reiterated at Buy, price target hiked to $76 from $74; PCG reiterated at Buy, price target cut to $46 from $48.50; CPN reiterated at Buy, price target cut to $23 from $24; AEP reiterated at Hold, price target raised to $50 from $48; D reiterated at Hold, price target raised to $66 from $64; DTE reiterated at Hold, price target lifted to $72 from $71; NU reiterated at Hold, price target lifted slightly.

Arch Coal sinks after Morgan Stanley downgrades on cheaper coal
Arch Coal (ACI -5.6%) is downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley, which expects even cheaper natural gas will knock down coal prices and ACI’s profits.ACI is a thermal-heavy name with significant balance sheet leverage, making it vulnerable to prolonged depressed market conditions, the firm says.Exelon (EXC -2.7%), which the firm also downgraded, is taking a hit; Consol Energy, which is also exposed to east coast coal is down too.The firm sees two utilities benefiting from current trends; Calpine (CPN +0.8%) and Dominion Resources (D +2%), although the advantage may already be priced into D’s shares.

Cramer likes three utilities amid debt disaster
Jim Cramer touts three dividend yielding utilities as the strongest bounceback candidates in the event of a U.S. default.Dominion's (D +0.2%) strong core utility business allows for the continued increase in dividends, Cramer says, and an MLP spinoff will bring in lots of cash.ConEdison (ED +1.5%) is a stock Cramer believes is somewhat insulated from the D.C. debacle simply because it services the New York metro area.He likes Southern Company's (SO +1.4%) "long-term history of paying the dividend through the toughest times imaginable... they get the sanctity of the dividend better than just about any other utility."Separately, New York Gov. Cuomo calls on the state's Public Service Commission to reject ED’s request for a rate hike next year.Utilities are generally higher today as investors avoid riskier bets amid shutdown and default nervousness.

LNG export critics say government should reassess economic risks
With the Obama administration approving a fourth company’s plans to export natural gas, some lawmakers and manufacturers say it’s time for the government to reassess the economic risks of the approvals.The export authorization for 6.37B cf/day of liquefied natural gas, including foreign sales from Dominion’s (D) Cove Point facility in Maryland, passes a 5B cf/day threshold at which some manufacturers say LNG domestic prices could be pushed upward.A coalition of large industrial users of natural gas, including Dow Chemical (DOW), Celanese (CE) and Nucor (NUE), say the Energy Department should tread more carefully, given the cumulative exports it has already authorized.The National Association of Manufacturers applauds the Cove Point decision, saying swift export approvals put the market and not the government in charge of deciding which projects survive or fail.

U.S. could approve further LNG exports if prices stay stable, Bernstein says
U.S. approval each year of 1.5B-2B cf/day of liquefied natural gas export capacity would be palatable for consumers, but energy policy makers would quickly hit the brakes and stall further capacity expansions if prices rise too fast or too severely, Bernstein analysts believe.Approving no more than 2B cf/day each year would mean 5B-8B cf/day of liquefaction capacity would be under construction at one time, allowing the government to monitor price impacts as exports layer in, the firm says.Cheniere Energy (LNG), Sempra Energy (SRE) and Dominion Resources (D) are among companies seeking to build gas liquefaction plants so they can export the fuel to places such as Asia, where LNG costs are more than four times higher than U.S. gas prices.

Rogers: Gold and oil headed far higher, EM far lower
"It sounds like America is desperate to have a war," says Jim Rogers, and oil and gold are going to go a lot higher if so. "No matter how well the plans are made, strange things happen in war and who knows what the unintended consequences will (bring)."Turning to the tumult in Asian emerging markets (Turkey thrown in as well), Rogers says we haven't seen anything yet. All of these countries have been financing huge trade deficits with the West's "artificial free money," and will suffer as that day ends. The real declines haven't even started, says Rogers, looking for something in the 40-80% range.On that note is this Ambrose Evans-Pritchard piece from last night arguing the Fed's blind eye towards emerging markets threatens a repeat of the fall 1998 panic. "Other countries simply have to take (the rout in their markets) as a reality and adjust to us," said the Atlanta Fed's Dennis Lockhart in Jackson Hole.

American Electric Power (AEP), Southern Co. (SO) and other utilities that have traditionally burned coal to generate electricity are exploring entering the rooftop-solar business, WSJ reports. They're testing the waters because they're feeling a pinch: Demand for electricity is barely growing in the sluggish economy, and developers of small-scale solar systems are giving customers another option for buying power.

Dominion Resources (D -0.4%) will foot the bill to close its Kewaunee nuclear power plant in Wisconsin, but it may obtain compensation from the Energy Department, which was supposed to start taking away the spent fuel from the plant more than a decade ago but didn't.

President Obama has signaled his support for increasing the U.S.'s exports of natural gas, saying that the country will probably be a net seller of LNG by 2020. The Department of Energy is assessing applications for 20 projects to export gas to nations with which the U.S. doesn't have a free trade agreement. Companies that could benefit include Dominion Resources (D), Cheniere Energy (LNG), Oiltanking Partners (OILT), Williams Cos. (WMB), Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP) and Sempra Energy (SRE). Dow Chemical (DOW) and Alcoa (AA) are among those to oppose increased LNG exports, as it could raise their costs.

Even as electric power producers shift further to low-cost natural gas, some with big stakes in coal and nuclear argue too much reliance on one fuel could bring troubles later. While gas looks cheap now, utility execs worry that emerging efforts to export natural gas to other countries could lift U.S. prices, and state regulators have been burned by wild price swings in the past.

CNBC's David Faber reports that Dominion Resources (D -1.7%), upon learning of the Duke (DUK -1%) deal for Progress (PGN -1.4%), sent letters to both companies with soft offers to buy each at a 10%-15% premium. The letter was not deemed actionable because it lacked specifics on key terms and who would head the company; Dominion is not expected to try to break up the deal.
