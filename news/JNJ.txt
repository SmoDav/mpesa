Lilly's Taltz beats J&J's Stelara in late-stage psoriasis study
Eli Lilly (LLY +0.5%) announces that a head-to-head Phase 3 clinical trial, IXORA-S, comparing Taltz (ixekizumab) to Janssen's (JNJ +0.2%) Stelara (ustekinumab) in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis showed Taltz's superiority. The results were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting in Orlando, FL.At week 24, the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement in symptoms was 91.2% for Taltz and 81.9% for Stelara. The proportions achieving at least a 90% improvement and a 100% improvement also favored Taltz: 82.1% vs. 59.0% and 49.3% vs. 23.5%, respectively.The FDA approved Taltz, a monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A, about a year ago for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Previously: FDA clears Lilly's ixekizumab for plaque psoriasis (March 22, 2016)

Janssen's guselkumab successful in two additional late-stage psoriasis studies
Results from two Phase 3 clinical trials, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE, assessing Janssen Research & Development's (NYSE:JNJ) guselkumab for the treatment of adult patients with severe plaque psoriasis showed significant improvements in skin clearance and other measures of disease activity compared to placebo and AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) Humira (adalimumab). The results are consistent with the data from the first Phase 3, VOYAGE 1, reported in October.In VOYAGE 2, 84.1% of patients treated with guselkumab achieved clear or minimal disease at week 16 compared to 8.5% for placebo and 67.7% for adalimumab.Through week 16, incidences of adverse events in the guselkumab, adalimumab and placebo arms were 47.6%, 48.4% and 44.8%, respectively. The rates of serious adverse events were 1.6%, 2.4% and 1.2%, respectively.In NAVIGATE, patients who failed to respond adequately to an IL-12/23 monoclonal antibody [Stelara (ustekinumab)] who switched to guselkumab experienced significantly greater improvements in skin clearance.Results from both trials are being presented at the 2017 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting in Orlando, FL, March 3 - 7.Guselkumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin 23 (IL-23), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. J&J expects it to be one of its major growth drivers. Its U.S. and EU marketing applications are currently under review.Previously: Janssen's psoriasis candidate guselkumab tops Humira in late-stage study (Oct. 3, 2016)

J&J's Mentor unit sued over leaking breast implants

BTIG says J&J's Actelion buy better for Actelion
BTIG's Dane Leone doesn't think much of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ -0.4%) $30B takeout of Actelion (OTCPK:ALIOY +0.5%), calling the $280-a-share price a "good deal" for Actelion shareholders. Negatives:JNJ will not own Actelion's pipeline. Its stake in the R&D spin-out will only be 16% (an additional 16% could be available via a convertible note) so it paid a substantial premium for the commercial assets.Anemic growth prospects. Despite J&J's claims that the deal will stoke growth, Mr. Leone believes sales growth will be flat to slightly negative through 2020.Deal structure limits operational synergy. His model implies a 0.7% average annual growth benefit for JNJ's EBITDA, but this is based on a 25% reduction in Actelion's cost base, an admittedly aggressive assumption given the deal provides for little operational integration.JNJ expects the transaction to be accretive, 1.5 - 2.0% above consensus, to sales while adding $0.35 - 0.40/share to earnings in the first year.BTIG has a Neutral rating on the stock.

Missouri Supreme Court denies J & J's requests to delay talcum trials
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.7%) has received some bad news from Missouri. The state's Supreme Court has denied its requests to delay trials over allegations that its talcum powder-based products caused some women to develop ovarian cancer. The ruling gives the green light for the next trial, set to start on February 6 in St. Louis.Attorneys representing the company and Imerys Talc America, the talc producer, also asked the Court to deny the St. Louis Circuit Court jurisdiction over the matter since most of the plaintiffs are not residents of Missouri but that request was rejected two days ago.Last year, St. Louis juries awarded plaintiffs $70M, $72M and $55M in three separate cases. They accused the company of suppressing and dismissing research that showed a link between the genital use of talcum powder in products like Johnson's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower and a heightened risk of developing ovarian cancer.J&J's attorneys have also been busy with a multitude of product liability lawsuits over a transvaginal mesh product, Abbrevo, marketed by its Ethicon unit. Plaintiffs allege that the product erodes over time causing organ damage and pain. The company and fellow mesh makers Boston Scientific and C.R. Bard face over 70K personal injury cases at the federal level and thousands more at the state level

Investors unimpressed with J & J's modest 2017 outlook; shares down 2%
Despite management's comments about growth drivers, focused strategy and potential value-creating deals in its earnings call this morning, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -2.2%) remains in the red, pressured by its modest outlook for this year.It expects earn $6.93 - 7.08 (+3 - 5%) on an adjusted per-share basis on revenues of $74.1B - 74.8B (+3 - 4%). Non-GAAP EPS in 2016 was up 8.5% yoy ($6.73 vs. 6.20) so this year's projection, intentionally conservative, conveys very modest expectations.Key milestones to watch are U.S./EU regulatory approvals of guselkumab for psoriasis, sirukumab for rheumatoid psoriasis and expanded indications for Darzalex, Imbruvica, Simponi and Stelara. Single-tablet HIV med darunavir (D/C/F/TAF FDC) is also expected to be approved in Europe.

Johnson & Johnson to publish report on drug price increases in U.S. next month
With the aim of demonstrating that it is a "responsible actor in healthcare," Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will issue a report next month showing how much it has raised U.S. prices for its prescription drugs. Its "U.S. Pharmaceuticals Transparency Report" will provide the average increase in the list prices for all of its drugs sold in the U.S. as well as the average price after discounts.The company says about 2/3 of its sales growth comes from selling more drugs instead of raising prices. It hopes that its disclosures will assuage the public and lawmakers who have roundly criticized the pharmaceutical industry for aggressive price hikes [e.g., Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) and Valeant (NYSE:VRX)].Recently, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) pledged to keep their price increase to less than 10% per year (still substantially above inflation, however).J&J pharmaceuticals executive Joaquin Duato says his company doesn't see the need to set price limits because it already keeps increases to single-digit percentages for list prices and low single-digits for increases after discounts.Source: WSJ

Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) anti-interleukin 23 (IL-23) monoclonal antibody guselkumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PA) showed a significant treatment benefit compared to placebo. The data were presented at the American College of Rheumatology and Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C.The study met its primary endpoint of a statistically valid proportion of patients treated with guselkumab achieving ACR20 (20% improvement in PA symptoms) at week 24 versus placebo (58% vs. 18.4%; p<0.001). All secondary endpoints were also met.At week 16, the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 also favored guselkumab (60% vs. 16.3%; p<0.001), as did those achieving ACR50 (34% vs. 10.2%; p=0.002) and PASI 75 (78.6% vs. 12.5%; p<0.001).Patients receiving guselkumab experienced greater improvements in enthesitis (inflammation at the sites where tendons & ligaments attach to bone) and dactylitis (inflammation of the fingers or toes).The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 36.0% for guselkumab and 32.7% for placebo.

J&J arthritis drug has mixed results against incumbents
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) says experimental sirukumab treatment for rheumatoid arthritis showed mixed results against AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) top-selling Humira in a large trial.By one measure, patients with moderate to severe disease who took sirukumab showed significantly greater improvement in the Phase III study than those taking Humira. But another comparison showed no significant benefit of one drug over the other.Results of the study were reported today at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology in Washington.Humira, and other older medicines such as Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Enbrel and J&J's Remicade, works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor ("TNF") that is involved in inflammation. Sirukumab is a member of an emerging new class of treatments that work instead by blocking IL-6, another protein involved in the inflammation process.Source

Generic drug makers scrambling to preserve marketing approvals of generic versions of J&J's ADHD med Concerta
Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK) and Lannett Company (NYSEMKT:LCI) are tussling with the FDA over its withdrawal of previously approved abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' (NYSE:JNJ) CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).The agency pulled the approvals due to the lack of bioequivalence. Although bioequivalence was the basis for the original approvals, field reports of insufficient therapeutic effect surfaced after the products were launched. In an analysis of reports from the FDA's adverse event reporting system, FAERS, the reported therapeutic failures of the generics in question were almost 10x higher than Actavis' (NASDAQ:TEVA) generic version, the reference drug. Further analyses showed differences in the rates of drug release and absorption. Specifically, the companies' products delivered the active ingredient at a slower rate 7 - 12 hours after dosing.Lannett has requested a hearing with the FDA on the matter. Mallinckrodt will have to do the same after an appeals court removed its pending litigation with the agency from its oral argument calendar. It has filed a Motion to Reconsider in an attempt to be put back on the docket. Both firms insist that their generic versions are safe and effective.

Janssen's psoriasis candidate guselkumab tops Humira in late-stage study
Results from a Phase 3 clinical trial, VOYAGE 1, assessing Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) guselkumab compared to AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) HUMIRA (adalimumab) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis showed guselkumab to be superior. The data were presented over the weekend at the 25th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress in Vienna, Austria.Guselkumab was administered via subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0 and 4 and then every eight weeks thereafter.The study met both co-primary endpoints of a statistically valid proportion of subjects achieving PASI 90 (90% improvement in symptoms or almost complete skin clearance) and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of cleared disease (score: 0) or minimal disease (score: 1) at Week 16 versus placebo. 73.3% of subjects met PASI 90 compared to 2.9% for control (p<0.001) while 85.1% achieved IGA 0 or 1 versus 6.9% for control (p<0.001).VOYAGE 1 also included an active comparator arm assessing guselkumab versus adalimumab, which was administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 1, then every other week thereafter. At Week 16, more subjects who received three injections of guselkumab achieved PASI 90 than those who received 10 injections of adalimumab (73.3% versus 49.7%) and a higher proportion achieved IGA 0/1 (85.1% versus 65.9%).At Week 24, the proportions achieved PASI 90 also favored guselkumab, 80.2% versus 53.0%. In addition, guselkumab maintained its superiority to adalimumab from Week 24 through Week 48.Through Week 48, the proportions of patients treated with guselkumab and adalimumab who reported at least one adverse event  were 73.9% and 74.5%, respectively. Serious adverse events were similar as well, 4.9% and 4.5%, respectively.Further analyses from VOYAGE 1 and results from two other Phase 3s, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE, will be submitted for presentation at future scientific conferences.Guselkumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin 23 (IL-23), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. J&J expects it to be a blockbuster and one of its major growth drivers.

TRACON Pharma teams up with Janssen in oncology
TRACON Pharmaceuticals (TCON) announces a strategic licensing collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (NYSE:JNJ) for two of its novel oncology assets. The deal also includes a $5M equity investment in TRACON by Johnson & Johnson Innovation via the purchase of common stock at $5.95 per share.The transaction grants TRACON the rights to develop two Janssen oncology programs: TRC253 (formerly JNJ-63576253), a small molecule high-affinity competitive inhibitor of wild type androgen receptor (AR) and multiple AR mutations that confer drug resistance, for the potential treatment of prostate cancer, and TRC694 (formerly JNJ-64290694), an orally available inhibitor of NF-kB inducing kinase (NIK), for the potential treatment of hematologic malignancies, including myeloma.TRC253 has completed IND-enabling studies and TRACON expects to initiate a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trial in H1 2017. Following its completion, Janssen will have an exclusive option to reacquire full rights from TRACON for an upfront payment of $45M, up to $137.5M in milestones and a low single-digit royalty on net sales.TRC694 is currently in preclinical development. TRACON expects to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application in 2018. Upon completion of an initial clinical POC study, Janssen will have a right of first negotiation to reacquire the program on terms to be negotiated between the parties. If Janssen does not exercise its negotiation right and TRACON continues development, it will pay Janssen a $60M milestone payment.The deal provides development funding for TRACON's lead product candidate TRC105 (carotuximab), a novel clinical-stage antibody to endoglin, a protein overexpressed on proliferating endothelial cells that is essential for angiogenesis.

Preliminary results from mid-stage study of triple combination HCV regimen show 100% cure rate after six weeks of treatment
Updated interim data from a Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating a triple combination regimen in treatment-naive patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection demonstrated a cure rate (SVR12) of 100% after only six weeks of treatment. The results were presented today at the European Association for the Study of the Liver Special Conference in Paris.The study is designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of different dosing regimens of odalasvir (ODV) and AL-335, with or without simeprevir (SMV). All patients (n=60) receiving a once-daily dose of AL-335 and SMV and ODV every other day achieved clinical cure (sustained virologic response 12 weeks post treatment or SVR12) after six weeks of therapy.All patients in cohort 1 (n=20) achieved SVR24 (sustained virologic response 24 weeks post treatment) with an eight-week regimen of AL-335 400 mg/ODV 50 mg/SMV 100 mg. Cohorts 3 & 4 (n=20 each) assessed the triple combination of AL-335 800 mg/ODV 50 mg/SMV 75 mg for six and eight weeks, respectively. All achieved SVR12.In cohort 2, 90% (n=18/20) of patients achieved SVR12 based on an eight-week dual regimen of AL-335 800 mg and ODV 50 mg.The triple combination regimen will be further investigated in Phase 3 studies.AL-335 is a uridine-based nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor being developed by Janssen (JNJ -0.4%) unit Alios BioPharma. Odalasvir (formerly ACH-3102) is an NS5A inhibitor discovered by Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN +4.7%). Simeprevir, a NS3/4A protease inhibitor, is currently marketed by Janssen as Olysio.

Geron down 27% premarket on uncertainties in imetelstat studies
Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) is down 27% premarket on robust volume in response to its update on two clinical trials being conducted by collaboration partner and licensee Janssen Research & Development, LLC, (NYSE:JNJ) assessing imetelstat in certain blood disorders. Investors were apparently expecting good news but will have to wait since both studies will continue in order to generate more data. In other words, proof of efficacy ain't there yet.The first trial, IMbark, is a Phase 2 study assessing two dosages of imetelstat (4.7 mg/kg and 9.4 mg/kg) in ~200 patients with intermediate/high risk myelofibrosis (MF) who have relapsed or did not respond to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. To date, over 90 subjects have been enrolled in the two arms. The 4.7 mg/kg dose has not demonstrated an acceptable amount of activity so the arm will be closed to further enrollment. Enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg arm will continue. The minimum number of patients needed for the Week 12 analysis was not met so the analysis will be done on 24-week data instead. Janssen will conduct an additional internal data review in Q2 2017.The second trial, IMerge, evaluating imetelstat in patients with low/intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have relapsed or failed to respond to an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, will continue unmodified. Janssen will conduct another assessment in Q2 2017.Imetelstat inhibits an enzyme called telomerase by binding to its RNA template. Most cancers have a high level of telomerase activity and relatively short telemeres (caps at the end of each strand of DNA) compared to normal cells. Inhibiting telomerase inhibits the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells. Sep. 12, 2016, 9:23 AM | 463 Comments
Interim data in mid-stage study shows Achillion and Janssen's triple combination therapy achieves 100% cure rate in HCV-1 patients
Interim results from Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) Phase 2a clinical assessing a triple combination therapy for the treatment of HCV showed a 100% cure rate in as little as six weeks. The data will be presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver Special Conference in Paris, September 23 - 24.The aim of the ongoing study is to confirm the required dose and treatment duration for an all-oral combination regimen of odalasvir and AL-335 with or without simeprevir for six or eight weeks in treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 patients.The 20 subjects in cohort 1 received a daily dose of the combination of odalasvir (50 mg), AL-335 (400 mg) and simeprevir (100 mg) for eight weeks. All achieved clinical cure 24 weeks after completed therapy (SVR24).The 20 patients in cohort 2 received 800 mg of AL-335 every day and 50 mg of odalasvir every other day for eight weeks. The cure rate at 12 weeks post treatment (SVR12) was 90%.The 20 subjects in cohort 3 received 800 mg of AL-335 and 75 mg of simeprevir every day and 50 mg of odalasvir every other day for eight weeks. All achieved clinical cure four weeks after the end of therapy (SVR4).The 20 subjects in cohort 4 received the same regimen as cohort 3 but for only six weeks. HCV RNA was negative in 90% (n=18/20) and the other two were below the limit of quantitation at the end of treatment.The triple combination (odalasvir 25 mg, AL-335 800 mg, simeprevir 75 mg) once daily will now be assessed in a Phase 2b study in 400 patients with chronic HCV 1-6 infection. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the estimated study completion date is July 2017. The Phase 2a will be expanded to include HCV-2 and -3 and those with or without compensated cirrhosis.AL-335 is a uridine-based nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor being developed by Janssen unit Alios BioPharma. Odalasvir (formerly ACH-3102) is an NS5A inhibitor discovered by Achillion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ACHN). Simeprevir, a NS3/4A protease inhibitor, is currently marketed by Janssen as Olysio.

Karyopharm's selinexor shows similar efficacy to Darzalex in treatment-resistant multiple myeloma; FDA filing projected in 2018; shares off 6% premarket
Karyopharm Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KPTI) is down 6% premarket on increased volume in response to its announcement of results from a Phase 2b clinical trial, STORM, assessing lead product candidate selinexor for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) over five-to-seven months.The single-arm open-label study evaluated selinexor, in combination with low-dose dexamethasone, in heavily pretreated (not responding to other therapies) MM patients. The overall response rate (ORR) in 78 evaluable subjects (median of seven prior treatment regimens) was 20.5% (very good partial responders + partial responders). For comparison, the ORR for Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) DARZALEX (daratumumab) in these types of patients was 20 - 21% while Sanofi's (NYSE:SNY) isatuximab showed 20%.The safety profile was similar to earlier trials. Additional data will be presented later this year.The company intends to expand STORM to include an additional 120 patients with penta-refractory (they basically haven't responded to anything) MM. Top-line data from the expanded cohort should be available in early 2018. The company plans to request accelerated approval by the FDA based on the results.It also plans to initiate a pivotal 360-subject Phase 3 study, BOSTON, evaluating selinexor, in combination with Takeda's (OTCPK:TKPHF)(OTCPK:TKPYY) VELCADE (bortezomib) and low-dose dexamethasone compared to VELCADE and low-dose dexamethasone alone in MM patients who have had one-to-three prior lines of therapy. The study should commence in early 2017.Selinexor is a SINE (Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export) compound. It binds to and inhibits the nuclear export protein XPO1 which leads to the accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins in the cell nucleus which amplifies tumor suppression. It is also under development for the treatment of liposarcoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia.Management will host a conference call this morning at 8:30 am ET to discuss the data.Previously: Karyopharm up 22%; selinexor data in multiple myeloma expected in September (Aug. 30)Update: Slingshot Insights has an expert interview on deck to discuss the Phase 2 data.

Tokai Pharma terminates late-stage study of lead product candidate in prostate cancer; shares plummet 70% premarket
Thinly traded micro cap Tokai Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:TKAI) craters 70% premarket on higher-than-normal volume in response to its announcement that it will stop its Phase 3 clinical trial, ARMOR3-SV, assessing lead product candidate galeterone compared to enzalutamide (XTANDI) in treatment-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) whose tumors express the androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7. The company made its decision based on the recommendation from the independent Data Monitoring Committee that the trial was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint.Tokai intends to evaluate its ongoing ARMOR2 expansion in mCRPC patients with acquired resistance to enzalutamide and its planned study in patients who rapidly progress on either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA).Galeterone is an orally available small molecule that disrupts the androgen receptor (NYSE:AR) signaling pathway by degrading AR, blocking the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone with AR and inhibiting CYP17, an enzyme that plays a key role in the synthesis of testosterone. Prostate cancer is stoked by androgens acting through the androgen receptor.Related tickers: (NASDAQ:MDVN)(OTCPK:ALPMF)(OTCPK:ALPMY)(NYSE:JNJ) Jul. 26, 2016, 8:43 AM

Janssen Research & Development (JNJ +0.5%) announces that the FDA has granted a fourth Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA) as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy.The FDA also granted the therapy Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for cGVHD. This marks the first time ibrutinib has been granted BTD or ODD for an indication beyond hematologic malignancies.GVHD is a life-threatening condition in which the body is attacked by donor immune cells after a patient undergoes an allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant.BTD status provides for more intensive guidance from the FDA, the involvement of more senior agency personnel and a rolling review of the New Drug Application (NDA). Among the benefits of Orphan Drug status is a seven-year period of market exclusivity for the indication, if approved.Related ticker: (ABBV +0.4%). Jun. 29, 2016, 9:36 AM | 5 Comments

Enanta Pharma initiates proof-of-concept study of novel HCV candidate
Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA +2.5%) commences the proof-of-concept portion of its ongoing Phase 1 study evaluating EDP-494, a pan-genotypic cyclophilin inhibitor, in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 or 3 infection. The double-blind, randomized phase will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-viral activity of two different oral doses of EDP-494 in treatment-naive HCV patients, administered once daily for 14 days.According to the company, there is increasing resistance to currently available direct-acting HCV antivirals (DAAs). EDP-494 avoids this problem via its unique mechanism of action, inhibiting a protein called cyclophilin which plays an essential role in HCV replication. EDP-494 is called a host-targeting antiviral which means that it targets the host proteins that are involved in the viral life cycle. Other HCV therapies are categorized as virus-targeting antivirals since they act directly on viral proteins. It says cyclophilin inhibitors may have the highest barrier to resistance of any class of HCV treatments.After the Phase 1 is completed, Enanta intends to develop EDP-494, in combination with one or more DAAs, for treatment-resistant HCV infection.HCV-related tickers: (GILD +1.6%)(JNJ +1.1%)(BMY +1%)(MRK +1%)(GSK +3.4%)(RGLS +0.7%)(ABBV +1.7%) Jun. 20, 2016, 10:06 AM | 15 Comments
Janssen's Eprex effective in late-stage MDS study
A Phase 3 clinical trial, EPOANE 3021, evaluating Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) EPREX (epoetin alfa) for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) met its primary endpoint. The results were presented at the 21st Annual Congress of the European Hematology Association in Copenhagen.EPOANE 3021 randomized 130 subjects to receive either epoetin alfa or placebo over 24 weeks. Patients receiving epoetin alfa experienced a statistically significantly higher erythroid response rate (31.8%) compared to placebo (4.4%) (p<0.001). Also, significantly less patients in the treatment group required a transfusion (24.7% versus 54.1%). Time to first transfusion favored epoetin alfa as well.The data have been submitted to the regulatory agency in France, the reference health authority, seeking an expanded label for EPREX in the EU to include this new use. A decision should be made in the next few months.EPREX is currently approved for the treatment of anemia in patients with renal insufficiency/failure, those with non-myeloid malignancies receiving chemo, adults with mild-to-moderate anemia who scheduled for elective surgery and to augment autologous blood collection in anemic adults who are scheduled for major elective surgery.Anemia affects the vast majority of MDS sufferers but there are no erythropoiesis stimulating agents approved for this patient  population.

Janssen's daratumumab shows positive treatment effect in late-stage study in multiple myeloma
Janssen Research & Development, LLC (NYSE:JNJ) announces results from from a Phase 3 clinical trial, MMY3003 (POLLUX), assessing DARZALEX (daratumumab), in combination with standard-of-care lenalidomide and dexamethasone (L+D), in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior line of therapy. The results were presented at the 21st Annual Congress of the European Hematology Association in Copenhagen.Patients receiving daratumumab and L+D experienced a 63% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to patients receiving L+D alone (hazard ratio = 0.37). Median progression-free survival (PFS) has not been reached in the daratumumab cohort but it has (18.4 months) for those treated with L+D alone.The proportion of complete responders also favored daratumumab/L+D (43%) versus L+D (19%) (p<0.0001) as did very good partial responders (76% vs. 44%; p<0.0001).Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody that binds to CD38, a protein expressed on the surface of many immune cells. Once bound, it induces rapid tumor cell death through multiple mechanisms.In May, the European Commission approved DARZALEX for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory MM who have been previously treated with an immunomodulatory agent (e.g., lenalidomide) and a proteasome inhibitor [e.g., Takeda's Velcade (bortezomib)].

Astellas initiates late-stage study assessing roxadustat in CKD-associated anemia triggering $10M milestone to FibroGen
FibroGen (NASDAQ:FGEN) announces that collaboration partner Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMF)(OTCPK:ALPMY) has initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in Japan evaluating roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis. The action triggers a $10M milestone payment to FibroGen.Under FibroGen's 2004 license agreement with Yamanouchi (predecessor to Astellas), Astellas is responsible for the development costs of roxadustat in Japan and makes payments to FibroGen based on the achievement of certain milestones.Roxadustat is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase. HIF is a protein transcription factor that "turns on" the production of red blood cells (erythropoiesis). Its value proposition is the ability to maintain hemoglobin levels in CKD patients without affecting inflammation and potentially avoiding the need for ongoing intravenous iron repletion therapy as needed with epoetin alfa [Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) Procrit] Jun. 9, 2016, 8:31 AM
Glaxo and Janssen's sirukumab successful in late-stage rheumatoid arthritis study; regulatory applications on track for Q3
A 1,670-subject Phase 3 clinical trial, SIRROUND-D, evaluating sirukumab in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) met both co-primary endpoints. The data will be presented at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology on June 11 in London.Results showed patients treated with sirukumab experienced significantly less joint destruction than placebo (p<0.001) from baseline to week 52 as measured by a method called Sharp van der Heijde Score which is used to measure joint damage observed in X-ray images. The sirukumab group was also superior to placebo in the proportion of patients achieving ACR20 (20% improvement in RA symptoms) at week 16 (p<0.001).All major secondary endpoints were also met. Regulatory applications are on tap for Q3.Sirukumab is being co-developed by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Janssen Biologics (NYSE:JNJ) in a partnership that began in late 2011. It is a human monoclonal IgG kappa antibody that binds to interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that plays a key role in autoimmune conditions. The companies expect it to be a blockbuster generating peak sales of $1B+. Jun. 8, 2016, 8:23 AM | 2 Comments
Regulus' four-week HCV regimen achieves cure rates as high as 100% in mid-stage study, investors unimpressed; shared down 5%
Micro cap Regulus Therapeutics (RGLS -4.9%) slumps on average volume after its announcement of Phase 2 data on lead product candidate RG-101 for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection failed to excite investors.The ongoing mid-stage study is assessing a four-week once-daily treatment regimen of RG-101, in combination with Gilead Sciences' (GILD +0.5%) Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) or Janssen's (JNJ +0.1%) Olysio (simeprevir) or Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY +0.4%) Daklinza (daclatasvir) in 79 treatment-naive patients with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 infection.Cure rates, defined as sustained virologic response 12 weeks following the end of treatment (SVR12), were 100% for the combination with Harvoni, 96.3% for the combination with Olysio and 91.7% for the combination with Daklinza.24 weeks after the end of therapy, however, the cure rates dropped to 80.0% and 88.9%, respectively, for Olysio and Daklinza but remained at 100% for Harvoni, clouding the picture for RG-101's efficacy.RG-101 is a microRNA therapeutic, specifically a GalNAc-conjugated anti-microRNA targeting microRNA-122. MicroRNAs are small bits of RNA, typically 20 - 25 nucleotides long, that do not encode proteins but regulate gene expression. Researchers believe as many as two-thirds of human genes are regulated by microRNAs. Jun. 7, 2016, 10:43 AM | 21 Comments

European Ad Comm backs AstraZeneca's combo med for T2D
The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion recommending approval of AstraZeneca's (AZN -0.7%) fixed-dose combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).Clinical data supporting the application showed the saxa/dapa combo with metformin statistically significantly reduced HbA1c levels compared to patients treated with placebo that required additional control to existing saxagliptin and metformin or dapagliflozin and metformin therapy. Another study showed the saxa/dapa combo added to metformin produced superior reductions in HbA1c compared to dapagliflozin or saxagliptin alone added to metformin.A final decision from the European Commission usually takes ~60 days.In October 2015, the FDA rejected the company's NDA citing the need for more clinical data.Related tickers: (NYSE:NVO)(NYSE:JNJ)(NYSE:SNY) May 27, 2016, 9:46 AM

MacroGenics inks collaboration with Janssen to develop DART-based cancer med; shares up 17%
Thinly traded micro cap MacroGenics (MGNX +16.5%) is up on more than triple normal volume in response to its announcement of a collaboration and license deal with Janssen Biotech (JNJ -0.3%) to develop and commercialize MGD015, a preclinical bispecific molecule based on its proprietary Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) technology, for the treatment of range of blood cancers and solid tumors.Under the terms of the agreement, MacroGenics will receive an upfront license fee of $75M, up to $665M in milestones and double-digit royalties on global net sales. It also has the option to co-promote MGD015 with Janssen in the U.S. and may choose to fund a portion of late-stage development in exchange for a share of the profits in the U.S. and Canada. Janssen will be responsible for completing IND-enabling activities and future clinical development.The collaboration builds on Janssen's experience with MGD011, a DART molecule targeting CD19 and CD3.MGD015 is designed to redirect T cells, via their CD3 component, to eliminate cells that overexpress an undisclosed antigen in various blood cancers and solid tumors. It is manufactured using a conventional antibody platform which avoids the complexity inherent in patient-specific approaches like chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T).The DART platform enables the creation of molecules that simultaneously bind to two or more targets. According to the company, a 2011 study showed DART molecules were consistently more potent in eliminating CD19-positive cells than a competing platform, bispecific T cell engager (BiTE), commercialized by Amgen (AMGN +0.3%) via Blincyto (blinatumomab).Previously: MacroGenics teams up with Janssen in blood cancer (Dec. 22, 2014)Previously: Amgen collaborates with leading cancer center on BiTE technology (Jan. 12, 2015) May 18, 2016, 3:50 PM
HP details its first 3D printers; 3D Systems and Stratasys rise
HP Inc.'s (HPQ +0.6%) first 3D printers will be known as the Jet Fusion 3D 4200 and 3200. As the company claimed in 2014, the industrial-class printers are said to print objects 10x as fast as current hardware. HP also claims they'll do so at half the cost, and - thanks to HP's proprietary Multi Jet Fusion inkjet printing process - give customers "an unprecedented ability to transform part properties and deliver mass customization."Initial partners for the printers include Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), contract manufacturer Jabil. CAD/CAM software firm Autodesk, industrial prototyping firm Proto Labs (PRLB +0.6%), and 3D printing software/services firm Materialise (MTLS +1%). Proto Labs will provide a product testing site for HP's printers, and Materialise's Magics 3D Print Suite will be compatible with them.J&J, meanwhile, will be collaborating with HP on using 3D printing to create personalize health care offerings. In the near-term, the companies will work on the "personalization of instrumentation and software for patient-specific healthcare devices."The 4200 will be delivered in late 2016, and the 3200 in 2017. Pricing for the 3200 starts at $130K (no word yet for the 4200). Long-term HP wants to offer 3D printers capable of embedding sensors and including "embedded information" such as invisible traces or codes.HP is hoping its entry into the growing 3D printing market will boost a printing unit that saw revenue drop 17% Y/Y in the January quarter to $4.64B. 3D Systems (DDD +3.2%) and Stratasys (SSYS +4.2%), two of the biggest players in the industrial 3D printing market, are trading higher.

China poised to approve HCV drugs, major players hope to capitalize
China's Center for Drug Evaluation puts hepatitis C candidates on an accelerated review track with the aim of finally granting access to the drugs for its ~13M HCV-positive citizens. China was not part of the large-scale licensing effort by Gilead Sciences (GILD -0.9%) in 2015 which enabled a number of generics firms to manufacture and distribute Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) to certain emerging markets at a heavily discounted price. AbbVie (ABBV -0.3%), Merck (MRK -0.4%) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY -0.2%) followed with licensing deals with The Medicines Patent Pool for African countries.Bristol-Myers, AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.6%) (via a joint venture called Xian Janssen) and Chinese firm Ascletis Pharmaceuticals all have submissions under review.  No word on Gilead's application status is provided. Apr. 26, 2016, 11:56 AM | 52 Comments
Drug prices to continue upward march according to bullish analyst
According to Leerink's Geoff Porges, drug makers appear to be taking little heed to politicians' outcries over high prices. In a research note, he says, "The price increases for established brands across our coverage have been substantial indeed. To the surprise of many investors, it now appears these price increases are likely to flow through to actual sales growth, with such growth more than offsetting any volume weakness in Q1 and resulting in significant positive revenue surprises for those companies when they report Q1 results."He cites Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ +0.8%) Q1 results released yesterday. Its total business was flat (+0.6%) but its pharmaceuticals unit was up 12.9%. His analysis showed as much as 90% of the list price increases are flowing through to reported sales, some as high as 100%.Over the past year, Amgen (AMGN +0.7%) increased its drug prices 8 - 28%, Gilead Sciences (GILD +0.9%) 10 - 18% for its HIV drugs and Biogen (BIIB -1.6%) 10 - 18%, according to Mr. Porges.Biogen reports tomorrow. Eli Lilly (LLY -0.3%), Baxalta (BXLT -1.4%), AbbVie (ABBV +0.9%), Celgene (CELG +0.4%), Bristol-Myers Sqibb (BMY +0.3%) and Shire (SHPG -1.6%) report next week.

Real-world study affirms benefits of Xarelto in preventing stroke and intracranial hemorrhage
Results from a study, called REVISIT-US, that analyzed almost 23,000 real-world American patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) showed that treatment with Bayer's (OTCPK:BAYRY) Xarelto (rivaroxaban) reduced the rate of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) compared to the anticoagulant warfarin. The data were presented at the 12th Annual Congress of the European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society.REVISIT-US, a retrospective claims analysis, showed treatment with Xarelto was associated with a 29% decrease in ischemic stroke accompanied by a 47% reduction in in ICH compared to warfarin. The data confirm the efficacy of Xarelto that was shown in the pivotal ROCKET AF study.Xarelto, discovered by Bayer and marketed ex-U.S. by the company, is being jointly developed with Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Janssen markets the product in the U.S.Rivaroxaban, a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant, is currently approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in AF patients with one or more risk factors, the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adults undergoing elective hip replacement surgery and the prevention of VTE in adults undergoing elective knee replacement surgery.

Regulus Therapeutics' HCV candidate RG-101, in combination with other antivirals, shows cure rates as high as 100% in eight weeks; shares up 11% premarket
Regulus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:RGLS) is up 11% premarket on higher-than-normal volume in response to its announcement of additional interim results from its ongoing Phase 2 development of RG-101 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The data were presented at The International Liver Congress 2016 in Barcelona, Spain.The study was designed to assess a shortened four-week regimen of RG-101, 2 mg/kg administered via subcutaneous injection at day 1 and day 29, in combination with four weeks of a once/daily antiviral: Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), J&J's (NYSE:JNJ) Olysio (simeprevir) or Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Daklinza (daclatasvir). 79 treatment-naive HCV-1 and HCV-4 patients were enrolled in three arms: Harvoni: n=27; Olysio: n=27; Daklinza: n-25.Cure rates at week 8 for RG-101 + Harvoni, RG-101 + Olysio and RG-101 + Daklinza were 100%, 100% and 90.9%, respectively. Cure rates at week 12 were 100%, 93.3%, and 100%, respectively (one relapse in Olysio arm).RG-101 is a microRNA therapeutic, specifically a GalNAc-conjugated anti-microRNA targeting microRNA-122. MicroRNAs are small bits of RNA, typically 20 - 25 nucleotides long, that do not encode proteins but regulate gene expression. Researchers believe as many as two-thirds of human genes are regulated by microRNAs.Previously: Regulus Therapeutics' HCV candidate shows 97% cure rate after eight weeks in mid-stage study; shares up 43% premarket (Feb. 17)Read now Regulus Add-On Could Help Regulate Hep C Drug Costs  Apr. 15, 2016, 9:03 AM | 33 Comments

Benitec's RNA interference-based hepatitis B candidate reduces HBV DNA by 98.5% in mouse model; shares up 26%
Sydney, Australia-based Benitec (NASDAQ:BNTC) announces that its DNA-directed RNA interference (ddRNAi) candidate, BB-HB-331, showed robust and durable hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression in vivo following a single administration.The HBV suppression activity of BB-HB-331 was assessed in the Phoenix mouse model in which murine liver cells were replaced by human hepatocytes which made them susceptible to HBV infection. Once infected, the mice received a single systemic injection of BB-HB-331. Serum antigen levels, HBV viral proteins and extracellular HBV DNA were measured once per week for the duration of the eight-week study.Results showed a 1.83 log knockdown of serum HBV DNA, equivalent to a 98.5% reduction of circulating HBV. In addition, intracellular HBV DNA was reduced 94.9% while HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg) were reduced by 97.6% and 92.6%, respectively. The results validated the previously reported in vitro findings.BB-HB-331 combines the gene silencing of RNA interference with the therapeutic potential of gene therapy. It is comprised of an AAV8 capsid (protein shell of a virus) and recombinant DNA engineered to express three short hairpin RNAs that target and inhibit viral RNA expressed from three regions across multiple HBV genotypes. The company plans to advance BB-HB-331 to clinical development.Previously: Benitec Biopharma's ddRNAi therapeutic candidate shows potent anti-HBV antigen activity in preclinical testing; shares up 14% (Dec. 7, 2015)HBV-related tickers: (NASDAQ:GILD)(OTCQB:COCP)(NYSE:GSK)(NASDAQ:IONS)(NASDAQ:DVAX)(NYSE:JNJ)(NASDAQ:ARWR)(NYSE:MRK)(NASDAQ:CTRV)(NASDAQ:ABUS)(NYSE:SNY)(NASDAQ:ALNY)(NYSE:BMY)Update: Shares up 26% in early trading.

FDA clears new indication for AbbVie's blood cancer med IMBRUVICA
The FDA approves the use of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) for treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The data supporting clearance was generated in the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 study which showed treatment with IMBRUVICA extended progression-free survival and increased overall response rate compared to the chemo agent chlorambucil.IMBRUVICA, jointly developed and commercialized by Janssen Biotech (JNJ -0.4%) and AbbVie's (ABBV +1%) Pharmacyclics LLC, was originally cleared by the FDA in November 2013 for mantle cell lymphoma. Its label was expanded in July 2014 to include a certain type of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in January 2015 to include Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Mar. 4, 2016, 1:27 PM | 4 Comments

FDA clears Gilead's R/F/TAF for HIV-1
The FDA approves Gilead Sciences' (GILD +2.2%) Odefsey (emtricitabine 200mg/rilpivirine 25 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg)(R/F/TAF) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in certain patients. Rilpivirine is from Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JNJ +1.8%).Odefsey, the company's second TAF-based regimen cleared in the U.S., is indicated for antiretroviral treatment-naive patients at least 12 years old with HIV-1 RNA levels no greater than 100K copies/mL. It is also indicated as replacement for a stable antiretroviral regimen in patients who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least six months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Odefsey.The company is transitioning its HIV product line to TAF because it is shows antiviral efficacy at one tenth the dose of TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) while being less stressful on the bones and kidneys.The FDA approved TAF-based Genvoya (E/C/F/TAF) in November 2015.Previously: Gilead submits NDA for single tablet HIV med (July 1, 2015)Previously: FDA clears Gilead's Genvoya for HIV-1 infection (Nov. 5, 2015) Mar. 1, 2016, 3:16 PM | 31 Comments
ViiV Healthcare's injectable HIV prevention regimen passes Phase 2 test; albeit with some discomfort to most participants
ViiV Healthcare, the HIV-focused joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline (GSK -1.1%), Pfizer (PFE -0.5%) and Shionogi Limited (OTC:SGIOF)(OTCPK:SGIOY), announces the results from a 41-week Phase 2a study, ECLAIR, assessing the safety, tolerability, dosing and satisfaction with long-acting, injectable cabotegravir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV infection in adult males not at high risk of acquiring HIV. The data were presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston.ECLAIR randomized 127 HIV-negative subjects 5:1 to cabotegravir or placebo beginning with a safety assessment on oral cabotegravir 30 mg or placebo tablet for four weeks followed by an intramuscular injection of 800 mg cabotegravir or placebo (sterile saline) every 12 weeks for three cycles.The proportions of participants who completed three injections for cabotegravir and placebo were 93% (n=87/94) and 95% (n=20/21), respectively. The incidences of Grade 2 (moderate) to Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) adverse events during the injection phase were 80% (n=75/94) and 48% (n=10/21), respectively. The most common Grade 2-4 AE was injection site pain (59% and 5%, respectively). The incidences of all grades of adverse events during the injection phase were 98% (n=92/94) and 90% (n=19/21), respectively.Following repeat injections, 74% (n=67/91) favored long-acting cabotegravir over the oral version.ViiV intends to advance cabotegravir to Phase 3 development later this year.Related tickers: (NASDAQ:GILD)(NYSE:ABT)(NYSE:BMY)(NYSE:JNJ)(NYSE:MRK)(OTCQX:RHHBY) Feb. 24, 2016, 1:40 PM | 14 Comments
J&J loses Baby Powder case, ordered to pay $72M
The circuit court in St. Louis orders Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.9%) to pay $72M to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer linked to her long-term use of the company's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products. The award consists of $10M in actual damages and $62M in punitive damages.The monetary award is the first by a U.S. jury over such claims, now numbering in the hundreds. The lawsuits accuse the company of failing to warn consumers that its talc-based products could cause cancer.Company spokesperson Carol Goodrich says, "We have no higher responsibility than the health and safety of consumers and we are disappointed with the outcome of the trial. We sympathize with the plaintiff's family but firmly believe the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence."In October 2013, a federal jury in South Dakota agreed with the plaintiff that J&J's body powder products contributed to her ovarian cancer, but awarded no damages.

Bristol-Myers' HCV combo shows cure rates as high as 99% in Asian patients with genotype 1b
Results from a 159-subject Phase 3 clinical trial assessing Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) all-oral HCV regimen, daclatasvir (Daklinza) combined with asunaprevir, in Asian patients positive for genotype 1b showed cure rates as high as 99%. The data were presented today at the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver Conference in Tokyo.The trial was an open-label design that evaluated daclatasvir 60 mg once daily and asunaprevir 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. 80% of patients (n=127) were from mainland China, 11% (n=17) from Korea and 9% (n=14) from Taiwan.Cure rates, defined as sustained virologic response at week 24 (SVR24), were 91% among all Chinese patients and 98% in those without NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) at baseline. SVR24 rates were high among HCV-1b subgroups including those with cirrhosis (90%), Koreans (94%) and Taiwanese (87%). Japanese patients were not part of the study.In all patients, the SVR24 rate was 99% (n=137/139) in those without NS5A RAVs, regardless of the presence (98%) or absence (99%) of cirrhosis, and 42% (n=8/19) in those with baseline NS5A RAVs.The daclatasvir/asunaprevir regimen is currently cleared in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and certain countries in Latin America and Eastern Europe. More than 13M Chinese are HCV-positive so approval there is a priority for the company.Related tickers: (GILD +2.2%)(ABBV +0.7%)(MRK +0.8%)(JNJ +0.5%) Feb. 22, 2016, 1:53 PM | 48 Comments
Regulus Therapeutics' HCV candidate shows 97% cure rate after eight weeks in mid-stage study; shares up 43% premarket
Micro cap Regulus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:RGLS) is up 43% premarket on robust volume in response to its announcement of positive interim results from a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing RG-101, in combination with other antivirals, in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.The study was designed to evaluate a four-week treatment regimen of 2 mg/kg of RG-101 at Day 1 and Day 29, in addition to four weeks of once/daily Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), Olysio (simeprevir) or Daklinza (daclatasvir). Seventy-nine HCV-1 and HCV-4 patients are enrolled, while 38 have been evaluated through eight weeks of follow up. Of these, 97% (n=37/38) had HCV RNA viral loads below the limit of quantification (SVR12). For those assessed through 12 weeks of follow up, 100% (n=14/14) remained below the level of detection.The primary endpoint analysis (12 week follow up) for all 79 subjects should be available in late Q2.RG-101 is a microRNA therapeutic, specifically a GalNAc-conjugated anti-microRNA targeting microRNA-122. MicroRNAs are small bits of RNA, typically 20 - 25 nucleotides long, that do not encode proteins but regulate gene expression. Researchers believe as many as two-thirds of human genes are regulated by microRNAs.Related tickers: (NASDAQ:GILD)(NYSE:JNJ)(NYSE:BMY)(NYSE:ABBV)(NYSE:MRK) Feb. 17, 2016, 8:55 AM | 65 Comments
FibroGen's lead product candidate beats epoetin alfa in mid-stage study in CKD-related anemia; shares up 5%
Data from a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing FibroGen's (FGEN +4.9%) oral agent roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed that patients on hemodialysis who were previously receiving epoetin alfa [Amgen's (AMGN +1.1%) EPOGEN or J&J's (JNJ +0.3%) PROCRIT] but switched to roxadustat maintained hemoglobin (Hb) levels regardless of iron deletion status, degree of inflammation or prior iron regimen over six or 19 weeks. The results were published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease.In the first part of the study, lasting six weeks, lowest dose roxadustat (1.0 mg/kg 3x/week) maintained hemoglobin levels on par with epoetin alfa. Some separation was seen at higher doses of at least 1.5 mg/kg with 79% of patients showing a hemoglobin response compared to 33% for epoetin alfa.In the second part of the study, 51% of the roxadustat cohort achieved a Hb level of at least 11.0 g/dL compared to 36% for epoetin alfa (normal range is 13.5 - 17.5 for men and 12.0 - 15.5 for women). In addition, maintenance dosing of roxadustat was not correlated with levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Decreases in cholesterol and hepcidin (key regulator of iron) were also observed in the roxadustat group.Roxadustat is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase. HIF is a protein transcription factor that "turns on" the production of red blood cells (erythropoiesis). Its value proposition is the ability to maintain hemoglobin levels in CKD patients without affecting inflammation and potentially avoiding the need for ongoing intravenous iron repletion therapy as needed with epoetin alfa.It is currently in Phase 3 development through collaborations with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMF) (OTCPK:ALPMY).Previously: Data from mid-stage study show CKD patients with anemia respond to FibroGen's roxadustat in dose-related manner (Aug. 13, 2015) Feb. 16, 2016, 11:53 AM | 3 Comments

TransEnterix up 22% premarket on bullish prospects
Thinly traded micro cap TransEnterix (NYSEMKT:TRXC) is up 22% premarket on robust volume as investors buy in anticipating improved prospects for the firm, including the potential for a takeover by companies aiming for a piece of the surgical robot pie, like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).In yesterday's earnings call, JNJ Chief Alex Gorsky said his company will be very active in the device arena going forward.TransEnterix is preparing to launch its CE-Mark'd Alf-X system in Europe and is in the process of securing 510(k) clearance in the U.S. for its Surgibot system. According to chief Todd Pope, Alf-X has many features that Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) da Vinci system lacks, such as eye-tracking software and haptic feedback which enables surgeons to regain the sense of touch and pressure feedback that they give up when using da Vinci. The single-port Surgibot system allows the surgeon to be in the sterile field which means he/she can stand beside the patient rather than behind a console. It also features a combination of reusable and disposable instruments. Jan. 27, 2016, 9:23 AM

Janssen stops trials of drug similar to one linked to brain death
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has stopped trials of a drug it's developing that's similar to the one made by Portugal's Bial that left a person brain dead and five others hospitalized with serious disorders in France.The company's Janssen unit has suspended two mid-stage international trials and says it hasn't received reports of serious adverse events in its studies.Bial's disastrous drug trial involved some 90 people taking a drug targeted at mood and anxiety issues. All trials of that drug have been suspended, French officials said.The drug in question in both Bial's and Janssen's trials uses an FAAH inhibitor, targeting the body's endocannabinoid system.J&J was studying patients with social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder with anxious distress; it will gather more information and re-evaluate.

Eiger Bio completes enrollment in mid-stage study of lonafarnib in hepatitis D
Privately-held Eiger BioPharmaceuticals completes enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing three (50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg) once-daily doses of Sarasar (lonafarnib), in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir [AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) NORVIR] once daily, in patients with chronic hepatitis delta (HDV) infection. The study consists of 24 patients with four placed in one of six treatment groups: three dosage arms for 12 or 24 weeks. Enrollment was completed in less than four months.Lonafarnib inhibits an enzyme called farnesyltransferase, which plays a key role in the modification of proteins in a process called prenylation. HDV uses this host cell process inside liver cells to complete an essential step in its life cycle. Lonafarnib blocks the cycle at the assembly stage, which may present a higher bar for the virus to develop resistance to therapy. It is designated an Orphan Drug in the U.S. and Europe and tagged for Fast Track review by the FDA.HDV, occurring only as a co-infection with HBV, represents one of the most pernicious forms of viral hepatitis. It causes more severe liver disease than HBV alone and is associated with more rapid liver fibrosis (scarring), liver cancer and liver failure. As many as 15M people worldwide are HDV-positive. It is particularly prevalent in Mongolia and Pakistan (as many as 60% of the HBV cases).Hepatitis-related tickers: (NASDAQ:GILD)(NYSE:MRK)(NYSE:JNJ)(NYSE:BMY) Jan. 19, 2016, 4:51 PM | 2 Comments

Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JNJ -1.2%) and ViiV Healthcare, the joint venture between Pfizer (PFE -0.7%) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK -1.9%), formalize their collaboration on a Phase 3 clinical trial assessing the injectable two-drug combination of Janssen's rilpivirine (EDURANT) and ViiV's investigational cabotegravir for the treatment of chronic HIV-1 infection. If approved, it will be an alternative to the standard three-drug oral regimen.The late-stage study will be led by ViiV with support from Janssen. The decision to advance the drug duo was based on positive data from a Phase 2b study, LATTE 2, which showed comparable efficacy of the all-injectable regimen, administered every four or eight weeks, to a daily three-drug oral regimen (cabotegravir plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). The results will be presenting at an upcoming scientific conference. Jan. 7, 2016, 9:50 AM

FDA beefs up requirements for surgical mesh products
The FDA issues two final orders today to surgical mesh manufacturers and the public with the aim of strengthening the data requirements for the use of the devices to repair pelvic organ prolapse (POP) through the vagina.The first order reclassifies the medical devices as Class III, a category for higher-risk products, from Class II, a category for moderate-risk devices.The second order requires manufacturers to submit a Premarket Approval (PMA) application to support the safety and effectiveness of surgical mesh for the transvaginal repair of POP. The actions pertain only to mesh devices marketed for this indication. They do not apply to surgical mesh used in other applications such as urinary incontinence or abdominal repair of POP.Mesh manufacturers will have 30 months to submit their PMAs for devices already on the market.POP occurs when the muscles and tissues of the pelvic floor become stretched or weakened and can no longer support pelvic organs, which drop into the vagina.

Drug firms far from transparent with trial data watchdog group finds
A study by not-for-profit ethics and governance watchdog Bioethics International (BI) of all clinical trials submitted to the FDA for drugs approved in 2012 showed a wide range of disclosure of results with almost all falling far short of full transparency. The lack of sharing of all trial data has been one contributor to the erosion of public trust in drug companies. According to BI President Jennifer Miller, Ph.D., only 12% of Americans believe that pharmaceutical firms are honest and ethical.Companies were ranked by both legal requirements to disclose data per the 2007 U.S. Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) and the ethical standard that all human-based research should be publicly available in order to contribute to generalized knowledge.The cross-sectional analysis of the 2012 data showed that 39 new medicines and 48 new drug entities were cleared by the FDA, 15 by 10 large firms. Researchers identified 318 relevant clinical studies (out of a total of 342) involving 99,599 participants. A median of 57% of the trials were registered, 20% reported results in clinicaltrials.gov, 56% were published and 65% were either published or reported results. Almost half of all reviewed drugs had at least one undisclosed Phase 2 or 3 study.Gilead Sciences (GILD -1.1%) didn't fare too well, providing only 21% of the data on its HIV combo med Stribild. Sanofi (SNY -3%) was also cited for its lack of reported data on MS drug Aubagio. Firms scoring well included GlaxoSmithKline (GSK -1.2%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.9%) and Pfizer (PFE -0.4%). All disclosed 100% of their trial data for at least one drug.BI is in the process of expanding its rankings to include other years.On a positive note, the major players have indicated a keen interest in doing a better job sharing trial data, motivated, no doubt, by the work of interested observers such as BI.ETFs: BIB, BIS GRX, IRY, IXJ, BME Nov. 12, 2015, 11:59 AM | 61 Comments

Johnson & Johnson buys clinical stage developer of HBV antivirals
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) acquires privately held Novira Therapeutics, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical firm developing therapies to cure chronic hepatitis B infection within one year of treatment, for an undisclosed sum. The transaction should close this quarter.Novira's lead product candidate is NVR 3-778, a orally available, small molecule, direct-acting antiviral that inhibits the HBV core or capsid protein. HBV core is an attractive drug target since it is plays a key role in viral replication and survival. NVR 3-778 disrupts the HBV life cycle by inducing the assembly of defective capsids. According to the company, its inhibitors, when used in combination with current standard-of-care drugs (nucleosides and interferon), should deliver greater and faster suppression of viral DNA and new virus production.Selected HBV-related tickers: (ARWR +2.1%)(GILD -1%)(CTRV -3.2%)(ABUS +2.6%)(DVAX -1.8%)(MRK +0.7%)(SNY -0.8%)(GSK +0.1%)(ISIS +2.1%)(ALNY +3.1%)(BMY -0.6%) Nov. 4, 2015, 12:48 PM | 11 Comments

ViiV Healthcare announces positive results from mid-stage HIV study of two long-acting injectables
A Phase 2b clinical trial, LATTE 2, assessing long-acting injectable formulations of Viiv Healthcare's (NYSE:GSK) (NYSE:PFE) (OTC:SGIOF) (OTCPK:SGIOY) cabotegravir and Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) EDURANT (rilpivirine) for the maintenance treatment of HIV-1 infection met its primary endpoint at 32 weeks. The results showed the two-injectable-drug regimen was comparable in maintaining viral suppression rates to a three-drug oral regimen of cabotegravir and two nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors.Viral suppression rate (plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/ml) at week 32 for the two-drug regimen dosed every eight weeks was 95% and 94% for those dosed every four weeks. This compared favorably to 91% for the three-drug regimen.Patients on the four-week regimen reported more adverse events (AEs) leading to withdrawal (5%; n=6) than those on the eight-week regiment (2%; n=2) and those on the oral regimen (2%; n=1). The most common AE was injection site pain (93% of injection recipients). Two patients in the eight-week cohort withdrew for injection intolerance. Two patients, one in the eight-week group and one in the oral group, experienced virologic failure.Cabotegravir is an investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor and analogue of ViiV's Tivicay (dolutegravir). It is being evaluated as a once-daily oral tablet and as a long-acting intramuscular injection.The results will be presented at an upcoming scientific conference. Nov. 3, 2015, 9:32 AM | 1 Comment
Pfizer rumored to be in negotiations with Allergan about potential merger
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is up 15% premarket on light volume on the news that it is in talks with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) about a possible merger. If the deal goes through, it would create the world's largest healthcare firm with a market value of $330B, larger than Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) market cap of $278B.A lower tax bill is one of the reasons Allergan is an attractive target for Pfizer considering the Botox maker is domiciled in tax-friendly Dublin. The U.S. government clamped down on tax inversion deals last year which scuppered the AbbVie/Shire deal so it is unclear how this might effect Pfizer's ability to change its domicile.Potential Pfizer takeover targets GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Shire (NASDAQ:SHPG) are both down slightly in premarket trading.Update: Both Pfizer and Allergan confirm the commencement of "friendly" discussions regarding a potential combination.

The study, called UNITI-2, assessed a single intravenous infusion of STELARA (130 mg or ~6 mg/kg) or placebo at week zero in patients who previously failed treatment with steroids and/or immunomodulators  and were either naive to or had been exposed to anti-TNF-alpha therapy but had not failed.At week 6, 52% of patients treated with STELARA 130 mg and 56% of those receiving ~6 mg/kg achieved clinical response compared to 29% for placebo (p<0.001). Clinical response was defined as a reduction from baseline in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of at least 100 points.At week 8, the clinical response rates in the STELARA cohort were 47% and 58%, respectively, compared to 32% for placebo (p<0.001). 31% patients receiving STELARA 130 mg and 40% receiving ~6 mg/kg achieved achieved clinical remission versus 20% for placebo (p=0.009). Clinical remission was defined as CDAI score of less than 150 points.The company intends to file an sNDA for Crohn's disease in 2016.STELARA, a human interleukin-12 and -23 antagonist, is currently approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis.

Delaware court reduces $100M transvaginal mesh verdict to $10M
In a partial victory for Boston Scientific (BSX +0.1%), a Delaware court reduces a $100M verdict award in to a woman in May for injuries allegedly suffered from the company's transvaginal mesh device to $10M. Judge Mary Johnston referred to the original award as "grossly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and shocks the court's conscience and sense of justice." The company wanted the entire verdict set aside and a new trial, but the judge denied the request. It intends to appeal the decision.In April, it settled 2,970 mesh-related lawsuits for $119M.

Boehringer Ingelheim's BI 655066 beats Janssen's Stelara in mid-stage psoriasis study
Privately held Boehringer Ingelheim's investigational biologic compound BI 655066 showed superior efficacy to Janssen Biotech's (JNJ -0.5%) Stelara (ustekinumab) in a 166-subject Phase 2 psoriasis study. The results were presented today at the 24th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology congress in Copenhagen.After nine months, 69% of subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with BI 655066 showed clear or almost clear skin, determined by PASI 90 [almost complete (90%) remission of symptoms] compared to 30% for ustekinumab. Patients in the BI 655066 arm achieved skin clearance twice as fast (eight weeks vs. 16 weeks) and maintained it eight weeks longer (32 weeks vs. 24 weeks) than those in the ustekinumab arm. In addition, 43% of BI 655066 patients maintained completely clear skin (PASI 100) after nine months compared to 15% for ustekinumab.BI 655066 demonstrated similar safety and tolerability to ustekinumab, regardless of dose, with no serious side effects. It is also being investigated for the treatment of Crohn's disease, asthma and ankylosing spondylitis. Oct. 8, 2015, 10:12 AM

Bayer's Xarelto cleared in Japan for treatment and prevention of certain blood clots
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approves Bayer HealthCare's (OTCPK:BAYRY) Xarelto (rivaroxaban) for the treatment and secondary prevention of pulmonary thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).DVT is a condition in which blood clots form in one of the large deep veins, usually in the legs. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a condition where a blood clot can partially or completely block a branch of a pulmonary artery. PE can be fatal if the clot is large enough, there are multiple clots or the patient has heart or lung disease. PE and DVT, known collectively as venous thromboembolism, is the third most common cardiovascular disorder.Rivaroxaban, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, is approved for seven indications across a range of venous and arterial thromboembolic conditions. It is being jointly developed with Janssen Research & Development, LLC (NYSE:JNJ). Sep. 24, 2015, 7:28 AM | 2 Comments
Open-label study shows ViiV Healthcare's once-daily HIV pill Triumeq no worse than other HIV regimens
An open-label 551-subject Phase 3b/4 clinical trial, called STRIIVING, assessing the safely, efficacy and tolerability of switching from an antiretroviral therapy (ART) to ViiV Healthcare's (NYSE:PFE) (NYSE:GSK) once-daily fixed dose Triumeq (abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine) in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection showed that viral suppression was non-inferior (no worse than) in patients who switched to Triumeq.The study recruited HIV-1-positive patients from a broad range of protease inhibitor (n=234), integrase strand transfer inhibitor (n=146) and non-nuclease reverse transcriptase inhibitor (n=171)-based regimens who had similar clinical profiles. The treatment satisfaction score improved significantly for those patients who switched to Triumeq (p<0.001) although there was an increase in adverse events (AEs) (4% versus 0%). The most common AEs were nausea (10%), diarrhea (7%), fatigue (7%), upper respiratory infection (7%), cough (5%) and headache (5%).ViiV Healthcare Chief Scientific and Medical Officer John Pottage, M.D., says, "For clinicians, choosing among antiretroviral therapies now involves balancing efficacy with factors such as tolerability, dosing, ability to use with other medications and resistance profile. These data support the use of once-daily abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine as a treatment option in the switch setting for appropriate patients."Related tickers: (NASDAQ:GILD) (NYSE:JNJ) (NYSE:MRK) (NYSE:ABBV) (NYSE:BMY) (OTCQX:RHHBY) Sep. 23, 2015, 7:27 AM | 10 Comments
Achillion's odalasvir achieves 100% SVR12 in six (or 18) HCV-1 patients in mid-stage study; shares up 5% premarket
Interim results from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:ACHN) NS5A inhibitor odalasvir (ACH-3102), in combination with Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), without ribavirin, in HCV-1 patients showed a 100% cure rate (SVR12) in HCV-1 patients (n=6/6) after six or eight weeks of treatment.The Phase 2 trial was an open-label, randomized, partial-crossover study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of six or eight weeks of odalasvir and sofosbuvir, without ribavirin, in patients with HCV-1 infection. Eighteen patients were initially enrolled, including six as observational (group 1). Twelve patients completed eight weeks of treatment (50 mg odalasvir/400 mg sofosbuvir) while the observational group received nothing. All twelve subjects achieved SVR24. Following this phase, the six observational patients plus six additional patients (group 2) received six weeks of treatment with the same combo regimen. All achieved SVR24. Six additional rollover patients (group 3) were treated for six weeks with the combo regimen and all achieved SVR12.In a summary that is a bit confusing,  the company states that 18 subjects (groups two and three) achieved SVR12 after six weeks of therapy, although it states that only group 3 (n=6) achieved this. Also, the total number of patients in groups 2 and 3 is 12 (6 + 6). Group 1 (n=6) is apparently included as well?In May, the company inked a global license and commercialization deal with Janssen Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:JNJ) for HCV products containing one or more of Achillion's HCV assets, including odalasvir, ACH-3422 and sovaprevir.Previously: Achillion inks collaboration deal with J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals in hep C (May 19)ACHN is up 5% premarket on light volume.Related tickers: (NYSE:MRK) (NYSE:BMY) (NYSE:ABBV) Sep. 17, 2015, 7:59 AM | 34 Comments
First patient dosed in mid-stage study of imetelstat in myelofibrosis
The first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 clinical trial, called IMbark, evaluating imetelstat in patients with myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder characterized by scarring (fibrosis) in the bone marrow which leads to severe anemia, weakness, fatigue and an enlarged spleen and liver. The study is being conducted by Janssen Biotech (NYSE:JNJ) under the terms of its November 2014 exclusive global imetelstat license from discoverer Geron (NASDAQ:GERN).The mid-stage trial will assess two doses (9.4 mg/kg every three weeks or 4.7 mg/kg every three weeks) of imetelstat as monotherapy in ~200 high risk MF patients who have relapsed or failed to adequately respond to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment [Novartis' (NYSE:NVS) Jakafi (ruxolitinib)]. An interim review of the data will be done after ~20 subjects in each arm have been dosed and followed for at least 12 weeks. The review will be the basis for any modifications going forward.The co-primary endpoints are spleen response rate, determined by the percentage of patients who achieve at least a 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at week 24, and symptom response rate, determined by the percentage of patients who experience at least a 50% reduction in Total Symptom Scores from baseline at week 24.According to clinicaltrials.gov, the final data collection date for the primary endpoints is March 2017. The estimated study completion date is March 2018.Imetelstat inhibits an enzyme called telomerase by binding to its RNA template. Most cancers have a high level of telomerase activity and relatively short telemeres (caps at the end of each strand of DNA) compared to normal cells. Inhibiting telomerase inhibits the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells. Sep. 16, 2015, 8:32 AM | 54 Comments
CareDx cell-free DNA assay included in NIH study of clinical outcomes in kidney tranplantation
CareDx (NASDAQ:CDNA) announces that its donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) technology will be used in a major NIH-sponsored study of clinical outcomes in kidney transplantation. The study, called The Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT) project, is being jointly sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).The study will assess if taking infliximab [Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) Remicade] just prior to transplant surgery, in addition to the typical anti-rejection drugs, protects the kidney from damage caused by TNF-alpha and whether it keeps the kidney healthy for a longer period of time. Infliximab blocks TNF (tumor necrosis factor).Preliminary data from CareDx-sponsored studies showed that dd-cfDNA increased prior to acute rejection events in transplanted hearts and kidneys and decreased following courses of immunosuppressive treatments.The company's dd-cfDNA test will be performed on CTOT samples to provide new information that could positively impact the care of kidney transplant patients by improving the quality of surveillance.

Goldman rate-hike plays: Favor balance sheet quality, avoid floating rate debt
With market eyes on a Fed rate-hike decision considered to be a bit of a toss-up amid differing opinions, Goldman Sachs is banking on the (slightly) more dovish position that the agency will wait until December. The bank is still laying out how to play the hike when it invariably comes.Strength in balance sheets is what you need, it says, noting that those companies outperform (by an average 5%) in the three months after a rate-boosting cycle begins. In Goldman's "High Quality Stock" basket: CMG, DLTR, PEP, KMI, BLK, GOOG, AAPL, PCLN, ORCL, WFC.Meanwhile, it suggests avoiding companies with high floating-rate debt as they bear the brunt of a move away from near-zero interest rate policy. "When the tightening cycle finally starts, the immediate impact will be felt by firms with high proportions of variable rate borrowing."Included in that "avoid" list: CL, COL, JNJ, AAPL, EBAY, MET, KO, GIS, F, MCD, GM, TWX, CVX, AGN, MON.(Yes, cash-rich Apple made both lists, having a strong balance sheet along with floating debt.)

Janssen Biotech submits sNDA for expanded use of IMBRUVICA
Janssen Biotech (JNJ +0.5%) submits a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) seeking clearance for the use of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).The data supporting the filing was generated from the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 study which showed ibrutinib to be superior to chlorambucil as determined by progression-free survival (PFS).IMBRUVICA, jointly developed with AbbVie's (ABBV -0.5%) Pharmacyclics, inhibits an enzyme called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The BTK protein transmits key signals to B cells to mature and product antibodies. Specific cancers need BTK to multiply and spread.IMBRUVICA is currently approved for the second line treatment of CLL, CLL with the 17p deletion, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and the second line treatment of mantle cell lymphoma.

Loews' Joe Rosenberg sees bottom in energy and other areas of value
A self-proclaimed "kid in a candy store" in 2011, Lowes (NYSE:L) CIO Joe Rosenberg isn't as excited now as he was then, but he remains a long-term bull and sees a few particular pockets of value.Source: Barron's On oil, either OPEC and non-OPEC countries reach an agreement to cut production and the price spikes upward, or there isn't an agreement and the price collapses - wiping out a lot of production. Either way, the price moves higher, says Rosenberg, and energy stocks (XLE, OIH) have likely bottomed.Rosenberg doesn't think the dividend gets cut at Chevron (NYSE:CVX), noting board members like John Stumpf were buyers of the stock at much higher levels. "The probability of them then agreeing to a dividend cut seems somewhat remote." A similar case can be made for Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) or ExxonMobile (NYSE:XOM).Catalysts for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) include a breakup into three companies, and better capital allocation - notably, getting far more aggressive with share repurchases. "JNJ could raise $50B in the bond market in a heartbeat and use that money to buy back stock." Don't rule out an activist investor if management doesn't get with it.Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are "incredibly cheap," says Rosenberg. The strong sales pace is sustainable because the average age of cars on the road in the U.S. is about 11 years - they need to be replaced. "The stocks are discounting a very bearish scenario."

U.K. clears Reckitt Benckiser's buy of J&J's K-Y business
Reckitt Benckiser (OTCPK:RBGPF) (OTCPK:RBGLY) receives regulatory clearance from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to purchase Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) K-Y intimate lubricant business with the proviso that it license the brand to a third party for eight years. During this period, the company selling K-Y would create its own brand, after which Reckitt would resume control of K-Y.Reckitt agreed to buy K-Y last year but encountered opposition from UK authorities who said the deal would reduce competition and result in higher prices for consumers. The CMA asked the company put forward measures to allay their concerns, but its initial proposals were unsuccessful.The company's plan to purchase the K-Y business in New Zealand was also blocked due to anti-competitive concerns. Reckitt chief Rakesh Kapoor isn't too concerned since the bulk of K-Y sales come from the U.S., Canada and Brazil.Under Mr. Kapoor, Reckitt is moving into higher margin consumer health products. The strategy appears to be working. H1 comps were up 13%. Aug. 12, 2015, 7:35 AM
Pfizer and Bristol-Myers lead in resurgent immune system accelerators for the treatment of cancer
A new class of cancer therapeutics has been rekindled of late led by Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). They are called immune system accelerators, antibodies that target a protein called 4-1BB, also known as CD137.When the immune system's T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells identify cancer cells, the 4-1BB protein appears on their surfaces which accelerates their attack. The protein was discovered over 20 years ago, but its development was abandoned in 2008 after early-stage studies done by Bristol showed signs of liver damage. Scientists eventually realized that lower doses of 4-1BB, given at the right time, could elicit the desired anti-cancer effect without the unwanted toxicity. Early results have been impressive. A 38-subject study done by Pfizer, 40% of patients with follicular lymphoma and a third of those with mantle cell lymphoma experienced a reduction in cancer with no serious side effects.Phase 1 studies are underway assessing combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors, like Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) Rituxan (rituximab) and accelerators. Studies are planned for Pfizer's 4-1BB candidate in combination with Herceptin (trastuzumab) and the combination of Bristol's 4-1BB candidate, urelumab, with Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Erbitux (cetuximab). Bristol in currently enrolling patients in five Phase 1 studies in multiple myeloma, lymphomas and solid tumor cancers. Pfizer is planning trials with an immunotherapy from Kyowa Hakko Kirin and Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) are a step behind doing preclinical work on their accelerator candidates.

Janssen submits sNDA for revised Olysio label seeking clearance for 8-week treatment period for HCV
Janssen (NYSE:JNJ) submits a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA seeking new labeling for its HCV-1 drug Olysio (simprevir). The current label specifies a 12-week treatment period of Olysio, in combination with Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), for patients without cirrhosis and 24 weeks for those with cirrhosis. The new label, if approved, will shorten the treatment periods to eight and 12 weeks, respectively. The shorter durations of treatment are supported by results from the OPTIMIST-1 and OPTIMIST-2 Phase 3 studies.Simprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, was jointly developed with Stockholm, Sweden-based Medivir (OTC:MVRBY) (OTC:MVRBF), which retains the marketing rights in the Nordic countries.Previously: Phase 3 results show HCV-1 cure rates as high as 97% for Olysio + Sovaldi (April 23) Jul. 24, 2015, 9:01 AM | 28 Comments
Gilead's next generation combo pill for HIV-1 successful in late stage study
Results from a Phase 3 clinical trial, Study 109, assessing Gilead Science's (GILD -0.4%) next generation offering for the treatment of HIV-1 infection showed that it was non-inferior (no worse than) to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based regimens such as Stribild at week 48. Additionally, the study demonstrated statistical superiority among patients with HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies/mL. The data were presented at the eighth IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment & Prevention in Vancouver, Canada.The product candidate is a once-daily single tablet combination of elvitegravir 150 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg (E/C/F/TAF). The value proposition of the new combo pill is comparable antiviral efficacy to TDF at one tenth the dose which mitigates unwanted stress on the bones and kidneys. This makes it a more desirable therapeutic option for long term use.Data from Study 109 show that patients receiving E/C/F/TAF experienced a cure rate (SVR12) of 97% compared to 93% for the TDF cohort. The rates of virologic failure were 1.0% for TAF versus 1.3% for TDF. General safety was similar.The company has three NDAs under review at the FDA for TAF products, one for two fixed-dose combination F/TAFs (200 mg/10 mg and 200/25 mg), one for E/C/F/TAF and one for the combination of emtricitabine 200mg, TAF and Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) rilpivirine 25 mg (R/F/TAF). The FDA has announced PDUFA dates for E/C/F/TAF (November 5) and F/TAF (April 7, 2016). The NDA for R/F/TAF was submitted on July 1 so a  PDUFA won't be assigned until the agency accepts the application for review. Jul. 21, 2015, 4:23 PM | 9 Comments

Johnson & Johnson in FBI's crosshairs over power morcellator
The FBI is investigating what Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) knew about the hazards of its laparoscopic power morcellator before it pulled it off the market in July of last year. The FDA warned the medical community last November that the device, which was used to cut up uterine fibroids for removal through tiny incisions in the abdomen, could increase a woman's risk of cancer. According to the agency, women undergoing fibroid surgery have a one in 350 chance of harboring uterine sarcoma. The cutting action of the morcellator blades could contribute to the spread of the cancer cells to other parts of the body.The FBI has interviewed a retired pathologist who alerted the company in a letter about the potential risk in 2006 and a California woman who has collected ~400 names of patients and families who may have been harmed by the device.Company spokesman Matthew Johnson confirmed the pathologist's 2006 letter and added that the firm revised its operating instructions as a result, adding to language already present which cautioned about the potential spread of suspected malignant tissue.The FBI also interviewed a Pennsylvania anesthesiologist who underwent the procedure in 2013 at a Boston hospital. The hospital acknowledged that it worsened her cancer in addition to another patient the year before.Previously: Johnson & Johnson withdraws fibroid treatment device from market (July 30, 2014)Previously: J&J halts the sale of Ethicon device (April 30, 2014) May 28, 2015, 9:20 AM | 4 Comments

FDA warns on potential side effect of new diabetes drugs
The FDA issues a warning that type 2 diabetic patients taking drugs called sodium-glucose contransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors to lower their blood sugar may have increased risk of developing ketoacidosis, a serious condition characterized by the buildup of acids, called ketones, in the blood that can be life-threatening if untreated for an extended period. It is caused by an insulin deficiency which forces cells to burn fat for energy instead of glucose which produces ketones.The agency is investigating the issue to determine if the safety risk warrants changes to the labeling of currently approved medications. There were 20 reported cases of ketoacidosis in the period from March 2013 to June 6, 2014, all of which required emergency room visits or hospitalization.SGLT-2 inhibitors cleared for sale in the U.S. are Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana (canagliflozin) and Invokamet (canagliflozin/metformin); AstraZeneca's (AZN -1.4%) Farxiga (dapagliflozin) and Xigduo XR (dapagliflozin/metformin); Eli Lilly (LLY -0.5%) and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Glyxambi (empagliflozin/linagliptin).

It was seeking an expanded label to include data showing treatment with the drug is effective six months longer than other commonly prescribed oral antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia.The FDA issues a CRL when it determines that a regulatory application is not approvable in its present form.The data supporting the sNDA was based on the PRIDE study which compared Invega Sustenna to other meds within the context of a real world setting. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure, which was more broadly defined to include psychiatric hospitalization, arrest/incarceration, suicide, treatment supplementation and increased level of psychiatric services, in addition to the typical endpoints of safety, tolerability and lack of efficacy.Invega Sustenna was originally cleared by the FDA in July 2009. It generated almost $1.3B in sales over the past four quarters.Previously: Janssen seeks expanded label for Invega Sustenna (July 14, 2014) May 13, 2015, 1:00 PM
Bavarian Nordic awash in money to fund Ebola and prostate cancer programs
The European Investment Bank loans Copenhagen-based Bavarian Nordic €50M (OTC:BVNKF) (OTCPK:BVNRY) to help it develop its Ebola vaccine and, to a lesser extent, its RSV vaccine candidate and CV-301, a cancer immunotherapy candidate. The funds follow a $100M infusion in January from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (Ebola vaccine), $25M from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.6%) for Ebola and $60M from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY -1.4%) for Prostvac.The company's pipeline of cancer immunotherapies, infectious diseases vaccines and high value collaborations makes it a prime acquisition target. This one will be gone within a year or two. May 12, 2015, 12:13 PM
WHO says Ebola vaccine trials in West Africa unlikely to show efficacy
One consequence of the wind down of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is that there is little chance that the vaccine trials going on there will show efficacy, according to the World Health Organization. Since the number of cases has dropped substantially, Liberia was declared Ebola-free on Saturday, Guinea reported seven cases last week while Sierra Leone reported only two, there may not be enough data to prove that people are actually protected.The FDA's Materials, Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting today to discuss alternative approval paths for Ebola vaccines, considering situations like West Africa. One option for approval is the "animal rule" which grants licensure based on the results from animal studies that show the vaccine is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans.Previously: Ad Comm approaches for alternative development and licensure paths for Ebola vaccine candidates (May 8)Related tickers: (MRK -1.2%)(JNJ -0.5%)(GSK -1.2%)(NLNK -22.2%)(EBS -2.8%) May 12, 2015, 10:14 AM | 1 Comment
Johnson & Johnson broadens pediatric access to darunavir in developing countries
Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies expands its policy of enhancing access to its HIV drug darunavir by significantly enlarging the number of low-and middle-income countries to 128 where it agrees not to enforce its patents and controls on the antiretroviral. The expanded geography is twice as large as the original territory announced in its 2012 policy. It applies only to pediatric darunavir products.The company's position allows for generic firms to manufacture and distribute their own versions of darunavir with the proviso that the quality is up to standard and the products are sold only in the indicated countries. Manufacturers will be responsible for obtaining permission from other darunavir patent holders and local health authorities.The 128 countries are home to 99.8% of children and adolescents living with HIV infection worldwide.

Ad Comm approaches for alternative development and licensure paths for Ebola vaccine candidates
The FDA's Materials, Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets Tuesday, May 12 to discuss the benefits and risks of various development and approval paths for Ebola vaccines.The committee will discuss three: 1) traditional approval based on clinical endpoint efficacy data, 2) accelerated approval and 3) approval under the "animal rule."Traditional approval is unlikely to be recommended due to the inability and unethical aspect of comparing the vaccine candidates to placebo and the difficulty of recruiting a sufficient number of subjects due to the significant decline in Ebola infection rates.Under accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit (e.g., immune response) may serve as the basis for licensure. In this scenario, post-approval studies would be required to verify and describe the vaccine's clinical benefit.The "animal rule" may apply if traditional studies are unfeasible or unethical and accelerated approval cannot be used. In this scenario, approval would based on the results from animal studies that show the vaccine is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans, provided that safety in humans has been established. Post-approval studies would be required here as well.Briefing information Related tickers: (MRK +1.5%)(JNJ +1.8%)(GSK +3.2%)(NLNK +3.1%)(EBS -1.6%) May 8, 2015, 11:33 AM | 5 Comments
FDA to hold public meeting on off-label drug promotion
Spurred by the progress of a bill moving through Congress that will speed new drugs to market for conditions lacking cures, called The 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has scheduled a public meeting this summer to address concerns by the drugs industry that regulatory restrictions on what they can say about the off-label use of their products violates their First Amendment right to free speech. Language in the bill is ratcheting up the pressure on the agency to relax its guidelines.Drug makers were emboldened on its prospects of changing the rules after an appeals court overturned the conviction of a pharmaceutical sales representative in 2012 who was convicted of promoting off-label uses of the narcolepsy drug Xyrem. The court ruling was based on First Amendment protection for truthful and non-misleading off-label speech.The American Medical Association supports the need for physicians to have access to accurate and unbiased information about off-label uses of drugs since it already accounts for as much as 20% of prescribing, with higher levels in oncology and pediatric rare diseases.Giving drug firms more leeway in this arena has its detractors, however. Rita Redberg, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the UC-San Francisco says, "At my own medical center we have banned pharmaceutical reps from coming because we don't think they are a good source of information. You don't ask the barber if you need a haircut."Pharma companies have a dubious history of breaking the rules governing off-label promotion. Over the past 10 years, 17 firms have paid more than $16B in settlements related to inappropriate off-label selling.Further complicating matters is the fact that up to 75% of published pre-clinical trial results cannot be reproduced in later studies.ETFs: IBB, BIB, IRY, BIS, IXJ, DRGS Related tickers: (MRK +0.4%)(LLY -0.1%)(PFE +0.3%)(BMY +0.7%)(GSK -4.1%)(OTCQX:RHHBY -1.1%)(SNY -0.6%)(OTCPK:BAYRY -0.5%)(NVS +0.1%)(AZN -0.3%)(JNJ +0.2%)(ABT -0.1%)(ABBV +0.1%) May 7, 2015, 11:13 AM | 6 Comments
Aetna to cease coverage of routine use of power morcellator to remove uterine fibroids
It took a while, but the first major health insurer announces its intention to stop paying for the routine use of the laparoscopic power morcellator. Aetna (AET -2%) says it will cease coverage beginning May 15. Doctors will have to be pre-approved thereafter based on exceptions for pre-menopausal women who want to preserve fertility and have no other treatment options and women for whom other procedures could lead to severe complications or be life-threatening.A power morcellator has spinning blades that are used to cut uterine fibroids or the uterus into pieces so they can be removed through small incisions in the abdomen, characteristic of minimally invasive surgery. Cancer cells can hide in fibroid tissue, however, which can be spread by the spinning blades, increasing the women's risk of cancer.A year ago, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.9%) stopped selling the product in light the risk. At about the same time, the FDA issued an advisory to clinicians to discourage the use of the device. In July, J&J started withdrawing the product from the market, including the return of already-purchased devices. In November, the FDA formally stated that the devices should not be used on the vast majority of women.Other insurers will most certainly follow Aetna's lead.Previously: Johnson & Johnson withdraws fibroid treatment device from market (July 30, 2014)Previously: J&J halts the sale of Ethicon device (April 30, 2014) May 5, 2015, 1:09 PM

Biogen Idec shortens name; CEO says drug candidates in neurodegenerative diseases could pay off big in five years
With a shortened name and new logo, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is entering a high risk-high return phase of its corporate life. CEO George Scangos, on board since 2010, is leading the firm into several difficult-to-treat areas in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (AD), ALS and spinal muscular dystrophy. It won't take but one or two successes for the payoff to be huge.Shares jumped on Friday after the company announced positive Phase 1b results for its Alzheimer's candidate, BIIB037 (aducanumab). If the Phase 3, due to start later this year, is successful it could be the largest selling drug in history. As many as 75M people could be living with AD by 2030.Mr. Scangos says, "The future looks pretty exciting for us. If the Alzheimer's thing works, then we're not just an MS (multiple sclerosis) company. We are broadly focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Five years down the road, with some luck, we'll have an Alzheimer's drug that's getting approved. I hope we can transform the treatment of MS. By that time, we will have made substantial progress on ALS and nerve degenerative diseases, spinal muscular dystrophy in kids. All that stuff is on our plate. I am sure of two things, not all it is going to work, but some of it will."The company is also working on biosimilars to Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) Enbrel (etanercept) and J&J's (NYSE:JNJ) Remicade (infliximab).

Interim data show Imbruvica combo significantly delays progression of blood cancers
A pre-planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 HELIOS study evaluating Imbruvica (ibrutinib) plus bendamustine and rituximab (BR) versus placebo plus BR in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) showed the trial met is primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee has recommended that the study be unblinded and patients receiving placebo plus BR be offered the option to receive Imbruvica.Bendamustine is a nitrogen mustard used to treat CLL. Rituximab (Biogen Idec's Rituxan) is a CD20-directed monoclonal antibody. CD20 is a protein found on the surface of B cells.HELIOS is the second randomized study to demonstrate that treatment with Imbruvica significantly improved PFS in CLL or SLL. The Phase 3 RESONATE trial showed similar results for Imbruvica as monotherapy compared to ofatumumab (Glaxo's Arzerra).Imbruvica is being co-developed and commercialized by Janssen Biotech (NYSE:JNJ) and Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ:PCYC).AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is undoubtedly appreciative of the encouraging results.

Traders spread their love beyond the rumored acquisition target-stoked up move of Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD +17.7%) to Geron (GERN +12.3%). Shares are up on a whopping 24M shares. Speculators are betting that Geron will be taken out, possibly by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.8%), after the latter was outbid by AbbVie (ABBV +0.9%) for Pharmacyclics (PCYC).Previously: Geron gets boost from AbbVie-Pharmacyclics deal (March 5)Previously: Acadia Pharma now +17.7% as it cancels out of another conference (March 10) Mar. 10, 2015, 3:51 PM | 9 Comments
Clinical trial planned to assess Halozyme's Enhanze in subcutaneous version of cancer drug
Copenhagen, Denmark-based Genmab A/S plans to start a Phase 1 study of a subcutaneous formulation of its monoclonal antibody, daratumumab, that utilizes Halozyme Therapeutics' (HALO +0.9%) Enhanze technology.Daratumumab, being developed under a collaboration between Genmab and Janssen Biotech (JNJ -0.6%), binds to CD38 which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells.Cancer immunotherapeutics are typically slowly infused intravenously into patients in order to minimize their side effects while delivering therapeutic doses of medicine. Halozyme's Enhanze, based on its recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20), has demonstrated that it can remove traditional limitations on the volume of biologics that can be delivered subcutaneously (just under the skin). This has the potential to significantly simplify and shorten the process of drug administration. Mar. 10, 2015, 1:23 PM
J & J on the hook for $5.7M in California mesh trial
In a trial over injuries blamed on the TVT Abbrevo transvaginal mesh, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Ethicon unit to pay $5.7M to plaintiff Coleen Perry. After more than three days of deliberation in Kern County, jurors found Ethicon liable for problems with the design of TVT Abbrevo and failing to warn patients about its risks. Ms. Perry was awarded $700K in compensatory damages and $5M in punitive damages.The verdict is the fourth win for plaintiffs suing the company over the product. More than 36,000 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts over the devices, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The FDA cleared it for sale in 2010.Ethicon won one trial in federal court in West Virginia, where another one started on Monday. Ethicon spokesman Matthew Johnson says the company believes it has strong grounds for an appeal of the California verdict. He says Ethicon stands behind the safety and effectiveness of Abbrevo, as well as its development and marketing.Ethicon, Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and C.R. Bard (NYSE:BCR) face more than 70,000 mesh injury lawsuits in federal court and thousands more in state courts. In December, a federal judge advised Bard to settle more than 12,000 lawsuits in light of the large verdicts awarded to date.Previously: Judge advises Bard to settle mesh lawsuits (Dec. 12, 2014)Previously: Boston Sci loses first federal case over vaginal mesh product (Nov. 14, 2014) Mar. 6, 2015, 8:04 AM | 4 Comments

AbbVie says three firms were bidding for PCYC in a very competitive process
On its conference call this morning to discuss the acquisition of Pharmacyclics (PCYC +10.6%), AbbVie (ABBV -2.4%) CEO Rick Gonzalez said that three companies were in the final bidding for the Imbruvica maker in an intensely competitive process. He said that a disclosure will be forthcoming that will provide additional details of the bids.The transaction will be accretive to earnings beginning in 2017, adding $0.60 to EPS in 2019 and more than $1.00 by 2021. The incremental sales in 2019 are projected to be >$4B.Imbruvica sales should be >$1B in the U.S. this year and peak at >$7B (ABBV's portion). Peak global sales may be ~$11.5B, but J&J's (JNJ +1.1%) contribution is its responsibility so no firm forecast is appropriate.Peak sales of the oncology portfolio of both companies could be >$20B by the mid-2020s.Mr. Gonzalez said that Humira's status had no bearing on the deal. He was confident with his top seller's long-term prospects, citing two new indications and the pending new formulation that will provide patent protection until the early 2030s. He also said AbbVie will vigorously defend Humira's IP against biosimilars.The transaction is 58% in cash and 42% in stock. The final number of ABBV shares will be determined at the time of closing in Q2. About 50% of the stock will be sourced from buybacks and half newly issued. The Board has authorized a $5B increase in its share repurchase program. There will be a 20% dilution to current shareholders. Updated 2015 Non-GAAP EPS is now $4.05 - 4.25 from $4.25 - 4.45.

AbbVie's high-priced takeout of Pharmacyclics bodes well for other biotechs with high potential drugs
AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) extraordinarily generous buyout of Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ:PCYC) is a crystal clear example of how keen big pharma is to boost its prospects with biotech drugs with blockbuster potential. The transaction's $20B tab, backing out PCYC's $1B cash balance, values Imbruvica (ibrutinib) at $40B since Pharmacyclics' commercial partner Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) gets 50% of Imbruvica's revenue. This implies a multiple of almost 7x Imbruvica's projected peak sales of $6B. By comparison, Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) takeout of Onyx Pharma and Sanofi's (NYSE:SNY) takeout of Genzyme were both at 5x premiums.The looming patent expiration for Humira ($12.5B in sales the past four quarters) undoubtedly provided AbbVie extra incentive to get the deal done.Adding 50% of Imbruvica's sales to AbbVie's top line should increase its revenue growth 3 - 7% and EPS growth 8 - 11% through 2020.According to RBC analyst Michael Yee, other biotechs on the big ticket acquisition radar are: BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:BMRN), Dyax (NASDAQ:DYAX), Esperion Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ESPR), United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT), Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:JUNO), Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE), PTC Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PTCT) and Receptos (NASDAQ:RCPT).

AbbVie-Pharmacyclics: More on the $21B buyout
Both boards have signed off on AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) $21B surprise acquisition of Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ:PCYC), announced a short while ago amid speculation that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) (or, earlier, Novartis (NYSE:NVS)) would be the one to acquire the cancer biotech.With the deal, AbbVie gets Pharmacyclics' blockbuster Imbruvica drug for hematologic malignancies -- which logged $548M in revenues in 2014 (Q4 earnings) and might go all the way to $5B/year. Imbruvica has received four indications in less than 15 months -- the latest being for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia at the end of January.And with Imbruvica, AbbVie can lessen its reliance on its key drug Humira, an aging rheumatoid arthritis medication.The acquisition is expected to close in the middle of the year.Question: What happened to Pharmacyclics' Imbruvica partner JNJ on this deal?Previously: Pharmacyclics Q4 revenue up 135%, Imbruvica growing exponentially (Feb. 18 2015) Mar. 4, 2015, 11:39 PM | 27 Comments

UnitedHealth requiring pre-approval on most hysterectomies
UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has tightened its controls on hysterectomy coverage -- requiring doctors to get pre-approval from the insurer before performing most types of the procedure.Only outpatient vaginal hysterectomies (a small minority) won't require approval -- but the overall insurance trend is for more pre-authorizations for care, and hysterectomies are one of the most common surgeries for American women.It's also another hit to the laparoscopic power morcellator -- which uses spinning blades to break up tissue through small incisions. The FDA started warning against using the devices last year, and many hospitals have banned them, as they can spread a dangerous uterine cancer.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) started removing its morcellators from the market last summer.

Makers of pricey drugs working on new payment model
Facing ever-increasing pushback from payers over the high price of new treatments, some biotech firms are working on a new payment model that rewards them for the long-term performance of their drugs. Gene therapy developers, including BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN +0.4%) and Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO -0.1%), are leading the effort.The industry says that a one-time cure, even if priced greater than $1M, saves money over the long term but acknowledges that payers will balk at paying the cost upfront. The general consensus is that an upfront payment over $1M will be unacceptable.Under a pay-for-performance scheme, the annuity-like payments would cease if medical testing showed that the therapy was not working. Much work remains to be done, though, before this approach could be implemented. For example, legislation may be required to force insurers to pick up the tab for patients that switch coverage.Some proponents of the new scheme say that the payment streams could be securitized and sold to investors, like consumer debt.Gene therapies represent the highest priced treatments. Only one has cleared the regulatory hurdle to date, UniQure's (QURE +1.5%) Glybera, which costs 850K euros ($1M) in Germany. It will be sold for a one-time payment because it is too difficult to measure how well it works (this reasoning will undoubtedly pop up again).Previously: UniQure sets price record with Glybera (Nov. 26, 2014)Related tickers: (CELG +1.3%)(AMGN -0.2%)(BIIB +0.5%)(GILD +0.1%)(MRK -0.3%)(GSK -0.2%)(AZN +0.9%)(LLY +0.3%)(NVS +0.1%)(PFE -0.5%)(JNJ -0.3%)(OTCQX:RHHBY +1.4%)(BMY -0.4%)(ABT)(BAX -1.1%) Feb. 19, 2015, 10:10 AM | 32 Comments

Express Scripts is Biotech's Grinch
Express Scripts' (NASDAQ:ESRX) success in containing the prices of new HCV therapies by pitting Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) against AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is sending shock waves through the biotech/pharma industry. Most of the big players slumped yesterday as investors fear that ESRX's tactics will spread to other high cost areas like cancer and cholesterol.At JPM15 yesterday, CEO George Paz said that the new cholesterol-lowering post-statin PCSK9 inhibitors will be the next big opportunity to pit drug firms against each other in order to drive costs down. FDA clearance of the first two therapies, one from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and the other from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) (NYSE:SNY), is expected to occur at about the same time.The prices of emerging cancer therapies will also be in payers' crosshairs. Amgen's Blincyto, for example, costs $178,000 per standard course of treatment while Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda is close behind at $150,000.Related tickers: (NYSE:AZN) (NYSE:GSK) (NYSE:LLY) (ABBV) (NYSE:PFE) (NASDAQ:BIIB) (NYSE:ABT) (NASDAQ:CELG) (NYSE:BMY) (OTCQX:RHHBY) (NYSE:JNJ) (NYSE:NVS) (OTCPK:BAYRY) Jan. 14, 2015, 9:13 AM | 56 Comments

Judge advises Bard to settle mesh lawsuits
U.S. District Court Joseph Goodwin took the unusual step of advising C.R. Bard (NYSE:BCR) to settle more than 12,000 vaginal mesh lawsuits it faces in light of the large verdicts to date. "I can't imagine a corporation facing potentially billions of dollars in verdicts wouldn't find it advisable to try to achieve a settlement for a much lesser sum," he says. "I base that billions of dollars business on some of the rather large verdicts that we've had." The judge is overseeing all federal court litigation involving the products. More than 30,000 cases have been consolidated before him.Women who have had the products implanted for the treatment of incontinence or to support internal organs claim that the devices erode over time causing organ damage and pain. Jury decisions so far have found the devices defectively designed or the manufacturers failed to adequately warn physicians and patients of the risks.In October, Bard agreed to settle 500 suits for $21M. In August, the company lost a case in West Virginia and was ordered to pay a woman $2M in damages.Bard is not the only company mired in litigation. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) have recently lost jury verdicts. In September, a jury in West Virginia ordered JNJ to pay $3.27M to a woman who received the implant. Juries in Texas and Florida ordered BSX to pay $45.2M to eight women and $73M to one woman, respectively.The FDA ordered the three manufacturers to study the rates of organ damage and complications linked to the devices.Previously: Boston Sci loses first federal case over vaginal mesh product (Nov. 14, 2014) Dec. 12, 2014, 8:14 AM | 2 Comments

Gavi gives Ebola vaccine developers an extra incentive to move quickly
The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, Gavi, plans to spend as much as $300M for up to 12 million doses of an Ebola vaccine as soon as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one for use. An additional $90M could be used to support countries that introduce the vaccine and to rebuild devastated health systems and restore immunisation services in Ebola-stricken countries.Gavi is funded by governments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Two vaccine candidates are currently being tested in humans in Phase 1 trials. The first trial, assessing Merck (MRK +0.8%) and NewLink Genetics' (NLNK -0.8%) candidate, experienced a hiccup recently when four volunteers complained of joint pain in their hands and feet.

Biotech industry group supports adding Ebola to Voucher Program Act
As expected, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) gives a resounding thumbs up in support of adding Ebola to the FDA Priority Review Voucher Program Act. Under the act, developers of a vaccine or treatment for a qualified tropical disease receive a voucher for FDA priority review for another product of its choice.Late Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted unanimously to add Ebola to the Act. Additional refinements to the legislation include making it easier for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add to the list of qualified diseases, allowing the vouchers to be sold and transferred multiple times and shortening the timeline for notifying the FDA of the intention to use a priority review voucher.The changes bring the tropical diseases priority review voucher program more in line with the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program.Ebola-related tickers: (GSK +0.2%)(JNJ +0.5%)(MRK +1%)(NLNK +2.2%)(TKMR -1.4%)(HEB +0.6%)(SRPT -0.8%)(BCRX +0.8%)(CMRX +3.2%) Dec. 5, 2014, 1:57 PM | 5 Comments
Hydration could save many Ebola victims
Doctors say that simple intravenous fluid drips could save the lives of many Ebola patients, but they are not being deployed due to a perception that no treatment will work.  Many patients are succumbing to extreme dehydration and electrolyte depletion caused by vomiting and diarrhea, according to Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Anders Perner of Copenhagen University. "Ebola treatment must be more that just a setting for quarantine. Patients will be reluctant to attend treatment centers unless the care they receive...is superior to the care provided by family members."The epidemic in West Africa has claimed more than 6,000 lives out of ~17,000 that have been infected.

Phase 1 underway for Ebola booster vaccine regimen
In a Phase 1 trial sponsored by the University of Oxford, 30 healthy volunteers will receive Bavarian Nordic's MVA-BN Filo booster vaccine in combination with the monovalent cAd3-EBO Z Ebola vaccine co-developed by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Recent preclinical research suggests that employing an MVA-based booster dose may deliver a more robust and durable immune response to the primary vaccine.The study involves 60 healthy adults divided into three cohorts each receiving different doses of the cAd3-EBO Z vaccine. Half of each cohort will also receive the booster dose of MVA-BN Filo.The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. The secondary endpoint is the cellular and humoral immune response. Preliminary results should be available in 1H 2015.Both cAd3-EBO Z and MVA-BN Filo have been developed in collaboration with NIAID, which also investigated the prime boost regimen of MVA-BN Filo and Crucell Holland B.V.'s AdVac technology.

The 210 mg arm and the weight-based analysis group both demonstrated superiority to Stelara on achieving total skin clearance as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 100 or 100% reduction in score).44.4% of patients in the brodalumab 210 mg group, 33.6% in the brodalumab weight-based group, 25.7% of patients in the brodalumab 140 mg group, 21.7% of patients in the Stelara group and 0.6% of patients in the placebo group achieved PASI 100. PASI 75 (75% reduction in score) scores for the same groups were: 86.3%, 77.0%, 66.6%, 70.0% and 8.1%, respectively.All secondary endpoints comparing brodalumab to placebo were also met. The first major secondary endpoint comparing PASI 100 for brodalumab 140 mg against Stelara at week 12 was numerically greater but not statistically significant (p=0.078). The remaining secondary endpoints for the 140 mg group versus Stelara were also numerically greater (all p values<0.05) but could not be considered statistically significant due to the sequential testing method.Previously: Positive Phase 3 results for brodalumab Previously: Amgen's brodalumab beats Stelara in Phase 3 trial Nov. 25, 2014, 4:47 PM

Drug makers face pushback on pricey meds
Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) is at the forefront of an increasing wave of resistance to the high prices of new drugs from pharma and biotech firms, some which cost as much as $50K per month. Pharmaceutical spending in the U.S. is $270B and may breach $500B in five years. ESRX's method of controlling costs is to refuse to pay for them. For 2015, for example, it is excluding 66 branded drugs from its main formulary, an increase of 18 from 2014's 48. On the list is Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) rheumatoid arthritis drug Simponi (golimumab) which costs $3K per month.Other prescription benefits managers are employing similar tactics. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) will exclude 95 drugs from its 2015 formulary including Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) multiple sclerosis med Rebif (interferon beta-1a) which costs $5K for a four-week supply.Governments are pushing back as well. Among 42 state Medicaid programs, 27 pay for Gilead Sciences' HCV med Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) only for patients with severe liver damage while others impose coverage limitations for patients with recent substance-abuse problems. In the U.S., the full regimen cost is $84K.

FDA downgrades classification of Mallinckrodt's ADHD med
Citing its new draft guidance for determining bioequivalence of methylphenidate hydrochloride products, the FDA reclassifies Mallinckrodt's (NYSE:MNK) generic version of Janssen's (NYSE:JNJ) Concerta (methylphenidate HCL) from AB (freely substitutable at the pharmacy level) to BX (presumed to be therapeutically inequivalent).The draft guidance, published on November 6, has an open comment period through January 5, 2015. Nevertheless, the agency states that the change in classification would be reflected in the November 13 update of the Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.Unsurprisingly, the company strongly believes its product is safe and effective when used as indicated. President & CEO Mark Trudeau says, "We believe that the FDA's actions are not supported by sound scientific evidence and not consistent with the best interests of patients. Mallinckrodt methylphenidate ER products have consistently met all quality specifications and the regulatory requirements originally defined by the FDA and in the 21 months since launch more than 88M doses of these products have been prescribed. In that time, and across all of those patient exposures, the company has received only 68 confirmed adverse events related to a lack of efficacy when the patient switched from the reference listed drug (Concerta) to the company's methylphenidate ER products. We believe that this very low reporting rate is in line with response rates recorded for patients switching between different formulations of existing products."Since the agency's action was not contemplated in the company's October 14 guidance announcement, it will update it once the potential impact is fully assessed. Mallinckrodt will report fiscal Q4 and full-year results on November 19 before the open.Methylphenidate ER was the company's top seller in Q3 in the Specialty Generics and API segment generating $54.7M in sales. This represented 16.6% of the segment's total revenue of $329.4M and 8.4% of the firm's total Q3 revenue of $653.1M. Nov. 13, 2014, 7:33 AM

American Century manager picks 5 stocks for the next market downturn
Phil Davidson likes to choose solid but "boring" stocks with healthy balance sheets and strong market positions in stable industries for his American Century Equity Income Fund, which is mostly focused on wealth preservation; when volatility spiked earlier in October, his portfolio fell 2.7% vs. the market’s 4.3% decline.His five favorite stocks he sees as pleasantly boring in a volatile market include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for its global dominance across all three of its businesses - pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices.PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is under activist pressure to split its beverage and snack units, an added bonus to a stock that's worth owning either way; Davidson thinks fears over the decline in the U.S. carbonated soft drink market are overblown.At Air Products (NYSE:APD), new CEO Seifi Ghasemi is a perfect fit to squeeze more out of a company that already has good assets in a stable industry, Davidson says.UPS has been under pressure to keep up with growing business to consumer shipments, and has spent money to increase capacity; the spending has weighed on earnings this year, but Davidson thinks it's bound to pay off.Commerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) has been a victim of the low interest rate environment, but Davidson likes its conservative business model.

Perosphere and Daiichi Sankyo ink third collaboration agreement on anticoagulant reversal drug
Privately-held Danbury, CT-based Perosphere enters into a third collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to study PER977, Perosphere's investigational anticoagulant reversal agent, in Phase 3 trials with edoxaban, Daiichi's investigational oral, once-daily factor Xa-inhibitor.In Phase 1 and 2 studies, PER977 showed that it directly binds to heparin as well as circulating direct factor Xa- and IIa-inhibitors reversing their anticoagulant effect. PER977 does not bind to blood coagulation factors or other blood proteins. In healthy volunteers, it reverses anticoagulant activity after a single IV dose of 100 mg - 300 mg and does not require an extended infusion in order to maintain the reversal.Under the terms of the agreement, Perosphere will seek FDA and EMA approval of PER977 to reverse anticoagulant activity of edoxaban and commercialize PER977 in the U.S. and EU. It retains full worldwide commercial rights to PER977. Perosphere will receive an upfront payment from Daiichi Sankyo as well as clinical development-related milestones.

Big money flowing to from med firms to docs
Yesterday, the U.S. Government released the first comprehensive disclosure of payments made by medical companies to doctors. Over the first five months of 2013, med firms paid $3.5B to doctors to fund items such as research, consulting, royalties to hospitals to help develop products and fees for speaking engagements. The monies were disbursed in two broad categories: research funding and fees to doctors for consulting and other non-research services.Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) Genentech unit led the way in the non-research category with $135M. Most of this (90%) went to a Southern California hospital network for royalties.Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) was #1 in the research category with $329M which, according to the company, was largely the value of experimental medicines used in studies.Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) paid one unidentified doctor ~$3M who was among a group of six physicians paid at least $500K by the device maker. The company's total outlay for the period was $30.1M.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) paid $68M for non-research expenses.The disclosures, mandated by Obamacare, cover 4.4M payments to ~550K doctors and 1,360 teaching hospitals from August to December 2013.The disclosures are a bit controversial. Physicians complained that the government did not give them enough time to review the data to correct mistakes.ETFs: IBB, BIB, IRY, BIS, IXJ, DRGS Oct. 1, 2014, 8:21 AM | 7 Comments

Biosimilars on the horizon in the U.S.
When the FDA finally opens the door for biosimiars in the U.S. it could save as much as $250B per year by 2024 according to Express Scripts (ESRX -1.3%). There are 14 biotech meds being targeted by pharmaceutical firms who want to sell cheaper versions. Novartis (NVS -0.7%) submitted the first filing with the FDA in July for its version of Amgen's (AMGN -0.9%) Neupogen (filgrastim). Regulatory clearance could happen as early as March 2015.Drug companies have sought at least 76 meetings with the FDA to discuss the requirements to bring 14 different biosimilar drugs to market. Nothing will happen quickly, though. Work remains on how to name generics that are a little different from the branded versions due to different cell lines used to create them and how to design clinical studies the prove they can be safely swapped with the originals.The U.S. is far behind Europe. The EC began approving biosimilars in 2006. A generic version of Neupogen was cleared in 2008.A second biosimilar approved by the FDA may be Celltrion's version of J&J's (JNJ -0.2%) arthritis drug Remicade (infliximab).

J & J artificial hip product liability trial set to begin
Jury selection begins for the first of some 6,000 product liability lawsuits facing Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) DePuy unit over its Pinnacle artificial hip. In the Dallas, TX trial, Plaintiff Kathleen Herlihy-Paoli alleges that the device's metal-on-metal design causes metal debris to leech into patients' bloodstreams causing infections that force many recipients to have them surgically removed.The Pinnacle product is not covered by the company's earlier $2.5B settlement of claims related to its ASR hip devices after the firm recalled 93K of the ASR implants worldwide. J&J stated publicly that the five-year failure rate was only 12%, but internal documents showed the failure to be much higher at 37%. The failure rate in Australia was 44% within seven years. The $2.5B payment settled ~8,000 lawsuits.Tests performed on Ms. Helihy-Paoli before she had both of her Pinnacle devices removed showed dangerously high levels of cobalt and chromium in her bloodstream. Her serum Cobalt level was 85x normal. When surgeons removed her implants they noted that the devices had turned black with metallosis. Sep. 2, 2014, 8:30 AM

State Medicaids feeling the pinch from Sovaldi
An analysis by Express Scripts (ESRX +0.1%) shows the enormous potential costs confronting state Medicaid programs of paying for Gilead's (GILD +1.1%) HCV treatment Sovaldi. The $84,000 full regimen tab will put substantial budgetary pressure on many states like CA ($6.8B), TX ($5.4B) and FL (3.8B) if every HCV sufferer is treated.Express Scripts estimates that more than 750K Medicaid patients have chronic HCV infections (total cost to treat with Sovaldi + ribavirin or Olysio (JNJ -0.5%) = ~$55B).Despite Gilead's assertions that Sovaldi actually saves money by curing HCV and avoiding the costs of liver failure, Congress has launched an investigation into its pricing rationale.

Janssen seeks expanded label for Invega Sustenna
Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ +0.2%) Janssen Pharmaceuticals submits an sNDA for an expanded indication for Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate). The label change, if approved, would include data showing significantly delayed time to relapse in patients treated with Invega Sustenna compared to selected oral antipsychotic therapies in the treatment of schizophrenia.In a 444-patient clinical trial, whose time to treatment failure was the primary endpoint, Invega Sustenna patients' delay of relapse was 190 days longer compared to other oral antipsychotics. The results were statistically significant.The FDA first approved the product in July 2009 as a treatment for schizophrenia. Jul. 14, 2014, 1:19 PM
Device panel member steps down due to conflict of interest
Dr. Andrew Brill had to recuse himself from the FDA's Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Ad Comm meeting this week due to his relationship with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ -0.6%) Ethicon unit. It paid Dr. Brill ~$213,000 last year in consulting fees.The Committee is meeting this week to discuss the future use of power morcellators used in hysterectomies. Some experts believe the devices assist the spread of cancer by disseminating undetected cancer cells as it divides and removes tissue. Ethicon markets such a device under the trade name Gynecare Morcellex. Jul. 11, 2014, 1:47 PM
Teva files a citizen petition regarding approvability of generic versions of Copaxone
In response to a request from the FDA, (TEVA) files a citizen petition (CP) on the approvability of generic versions of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection). The agency wanted a CP in order to facilitate public review and comment on new scientific data on gene expression. This will allow Teva to comment publicly on the views and opinions of others and will create an administrative record that the FDA may use as a basis for future decisions.Teva's CP provides new scientific data on gene expression and evidence to support arguments that active ingredient sameness, immunogenicity and bioequivalence in generic offerings are similar but not the same as Copaxone. The company says that competitive offerings should use the same gene expression markers and biological pathways to demonstrate sameness and be evaluated in full-scale clinical trials.One possible outcome of Teva's aggressive efforts to maintain a moat around Copaxone is that it may give it more empathy for branded drug makers when it goes after incumbent products with its own generic versions.Related tickers: (MNK) (ACT) (JNJ) (MYL) (MNTA) (NVS) Jul. 3, 2014, 8:28 AM | 1 Comment

Oregon Health Plan says no to unlimited access to pricey Hep C drugs
Taking advantage of a special waiver that allows it to deny routine coverage of drugs based on cost and efficacy, Oregon Health Plan intends to limit access to Gilead's (GILD) Sovaldi and J&J's (JNJ) Olysio. The combination therapy, which is becoming more and more popular among clinicians, costs $150,000 per regimen. Covering a third of the 7,000 OHP members with Hep C for Sovaldi alone ($84,000/regimen) would cost $196M. This would double its system-wide drug spending. Last year, the Plan spent a total of $377M for pharmaceuticals for all of its 600K members.In 2012, Governor John Kitzhaber agreed to cap OHP costs in exchange for $1.9B in federal aid over five years. If costs rise above 3.4%/year it must reimburse the feds hundreds of millions of dollars.The OHP situation is getting a lot of scrutiny because of the budget-busting consequences of paying for ultra-expensive drugs. Many observers hope its actions spur debate on how to curb prices without stifling innovation. Jun. 12, 2014, 9:21 AM | 28 Comments

FDA gives a thumbs up to Entyvio
The FDA approves Takeda's Entyvio (vedolizumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease in adult patients who have not responded to one or more standard therapies.Vedolizumab is an integrin receptor antagonist. Integrin receptors are proteins expressed on the surface of certain cells and function as bridges for cell-to-cell interactions. The mAb works by blocking the migration of circulating inflammatory cells across blood vessels and into areas of inflammation in the GI tract.Related tickers: (SHPG) (JNJ) (AZN) (BIIB) (ABBV) May 20, 2014, 5:07 PM | 2 Comments
Sovaldi dominates in HCV
In a survey of specialists, Research firm Decision Resources Group finds that Gilead's (GILD +1.3%) HCV treatment Sovaldi accounts for 50% of the patient share followed by J&J's (JNJ -0.3%) Olysio at 20%.The majority of Olysio prescriptions are being written for the off-label combination with Sovaldi with or without ribavarin. Trending analysis shows that the off-label prescribing for the combination has more than doubled with 30% of specialists reporting having at least some patients on the regimen.Hepatologists are more likely to prescribe the Sovaldi/Olysio combination than gastroenterologists or infectious disease specialists. The latter two have the majority of their HCV-1 patients on first-gen protease inhibitor therapy. The reason for the disparity appears to be awareness. May 19, 2014, 11:32 AM | 9 Comments

Brit health care agency says no to earlier use of Zytiga
Britain's healthcare cost effectiveness agency NICE says J&J's (JNJ) Zytiga (abiraterone) is not worth giving to patients who have yet to receive chemotherapy. The drug is currently approved for use in some men after chemo.Apparently, J&J's own economic model shows Zytiga is not cost effective when used earlier. The once-daily tablet costs 2,930 pounds ($4,900) for a 120-tablet regimen.Institute of Cancer Research deputy chief executive Paul Workman is disappointed in NICE's decision and urges the parties to work together on a revised price that would make the economics attractive.

Several meds may help break the alcohol habit
An analysis of more than 120 studies finds that naltrexone, Forest Labs' (FRX) Campral (acamprosate), J&J's (JNJ) Topamax (topiramate) and H. Lundbeck A/S' Selincro (nalmefene) all helped alcoholics reduce their drinking.The oldest FDA-approved alcoholism drug, Antabuse (disulfiram), did not prevent a return to the bottle.Alkermes Plc's (ALKS) injectable Vivitrol (naltrexone) reduced patients' heavy drinking days but there were not enough studies to draw conclusions.The drugs are underutilized because many primary care physicians refer patients with drinking problems to specialists like drug counselors or to groups like AA. None of these providers can prescribe medicines.There are almost two dozen drugs that are used off-label to combat alcoholism. No one product works for everyone, though. On average, 12 people need to be treated with acamprosate for one person to benefit. For naltrexone, the ratio is 20:1.Predictably, the researchers say more studies are needed.

French plan to allow generics alarms Big Pharma
In its recent healthcare budget, French lawmakers introduced a measure that will allow pharmacists to substitute generics for prescribed brand-name biotech drugs. This has rattled the industry since France is Europe's #2 pharmaceutical market behind Germany.A decree must be passed before it becomes effective.France is the first European country to pursue biologic substitution. Big Pharma fears a domino effect if it is successful despite the heretofore slow uptake of biosimilars.The initiative applies only to patients starting a new course of treatment. Doctors will still retain the ability to demand the branded product.Unsurprisingly, Big Pharma is upset at not being consulted prior to the law's passage.Some analysts believe France could save up to $1.4B by 2020 by using generics.Substitutions only apply to retail pharmacies. 40% of biotech prescriptions are filled in hospitals.(RHHBY) (AMGN) (NVS) (SNY) (LLY) (PFE) (BMY) (MRK) (GSK) (JNJ) (HSP) (ABBV) (AZN) (BAYRY) Apr. 10, 2014, 9:32 AM | 12 Comments

California Technology Assessment Forum members give a "low value" rating to Gilead's (GILD) pricey hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi citing its high cost. The vote is non-binding but could influence coverage decisions by payers.The panel agrees that not all hep C patients require the most expensive drugs. If California treated every patient with liver damage it would cost the state over $6B.Sovaldi's treatment regimen costs $84,000 compared to $66,000 for J&J's (JNJ) Olysio.

Big Pharma lobbies Australia to extend poppy growing
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and TPI Enterprises want the government of Australia to let them grow poppies on the country's mainland, due to a shortage of opium for pain killers and amid soaring demand.Australia only allows poppy growing in Tasmania, which is responsible for around half of the world's supply of opiate-based pain relief. Recent drought and storms in Tasmania have meant that drug firms can't get enough crops. Mar. 11, 2014, 9:24 AM | 4 Comments
On the hunt with the "pharmaceutical scouts"
The WSJ profiles "pharmaceutical scouts," who, like talent-spotters in baseball "trying to pick tomorrow's big-leaguers from farm teams," search outside their companies to find drug candidates that have the potential to become blockbusters.In 2011, for instance, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Peter Lebowitz helped his company beat competitors such as Novartis (NVS) to buy the rights to a blood-cancer drug from Pharmacyclics (PCYC) called Imbruvica.The treatment was eventually approved in November for a rare lymphoma and for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in February.  J.P. Morgan forecasts Imbruvica will generate $1.3B in revenue for J&J in 2017.Half of J&J's drug pipeline is from outside the company, up from 20% in 2002.Other related tickers: MRK, RHHBY, BMY, SNY, CELG, GSK Mar. 10, 2014, 10:00 AM | 1 Comment

J&J to share trial data via agreement with Yale
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has become the latest major pharmaceutical firm to say that it will make more data from its clinical trials available to researchers.JNJ has signed an agreement with Yale University to share information about hundreds of drugs and other products.Yale will vet requests from researchers without input from J&J.Part of the idea is to increase the credibility of the data. "The medical scientific community and population at large want to have more transparency on what we do," says J&J's Paul Stoffels. "To get really credible, we took the leap."Other big pharma companies to pledge to release data in the past year include GSK and Roche. (PR) Jan. 30, 2014, 9:31 AM
Medivation +8.2% AH as prostate cancer drug impresses in pre-chemo study
Medivation (MDVN) +8.2% AH after its Xtandi drug for advanced prostate cancer was found to significantly delay progression of the disease and extend survival in a large, late stage study of patients who had not yet received chemotherapy.Xtandi (enzalutamide) already is approved to treat patients whose prostate cancer has spread and who had previously been treated with chemotherapy; approval for use prior to chemo could greatly expand the available patient population, significantly boost sales, and enable the drug to compete with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga.Sanford Bernstein says annual Xtandi sales eventually could exceed $3B with a pre-chemo approval.

FDA unconvinced by J&J's Xarelto for heart attack patients
The FDA expresses skepticism that Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) anticoagulant Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is effective in cutting the risk of additional heart problems in heart-attack patients.J&J has recommended that Xarelto, which is already authorized for other uses, be administered in the 90 days after an attack.However, the FDA doesn't see the point. "Not only does the effect of rivaroxaban not appear to be greater earlier, but an effect in the first 90 days or so is not apparent at all," the agency says in a review.The FDA's comments come two days before an advisory panel is due to discuss whether to recommend Xarelto for this indication.Bayer (BAYRY) co-markets Xarelto.

Leerink makes MedTech picks for 2014
Leerink is out with some commentary on the MedTech space.Investors should "focus on companies with growth acceleration and/or upside surprise potential independent of (or at least less dependent on) a macroeconomic recovery [or, alternatively,] a higher and increasing percentage of sales derived from end-markets exhibiting above-average growth," Leerink says.Not surprisingly, the LVAD device market gets a mention, with Heartware (HTWR) recommended by name (remember, they just snapped up CircuLite which some think can compete with SSH's C-Pulse).
Other names mentioned by Leerink: Covidien (COV) for neurovascular and energy devices; Stryker (SYK) for neurovascular and robotics; St. Jude's Medical (STJ) and JNJ for atrial fibrillation; Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).Thoratec (THOR) gets an LVAD mention as well, which is interesting considering Leerink's recent commentary on the NEJM manuscript which discussed possible thrombus formation with the HeartMate II.

How big pharma sells A.D.H.D

One doctor calls the rising rates of diagnosis "a national disaster of dangerous proportions."The FDA has cited every major A.D.H.D. drug - including Adderall, Concerta (JNJ), Focalin (NVS, CELG) and Vyvanse (SHPG) - for false and misleading advertising since 2000, some multiple times.

Renal-artery stenting may be no better than drug therapy: Study
"People are doing renal artery stenting with the belief that it will help difficult to treat hypertension, multidrug resistant hypertension, all those categories [but] this suggests that it doesn’t work," the AHA's chairman of scientific sessions says, referencing a new study which casts further doubt on whether renal stenting significantly improves cardiovascular outcomes compared to drug therapy.The numbers: 35.1% of patients with moderately clogged kidney arteries and high blood pressure either died or experienced complications from heart or kidney disease after 3.5 years with a stent plus drug therapy, versus 35.8% for similar patients that were given drug therapy alone.Here's Munroe Regional Medical Center's John Bittl (as quoted by Bloomberg): This "establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that renal-artery stenting is futile for the target population enrolled in the study."Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) makes a peripheral stent called Palmaz Genesis, while big names in the blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering drug business include AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE).

Be wary of multiple expansion, heterogeneous high-yield universe: GMO's Inker
"Our problem is that the S&P is up this year about 25% on earnings that are up 3%. So we've got a market that is rising because of P/E expansion," 21-year GMO veteran Ben Inker tells Barron's (one recalls a similar warning from Guggenheim back in August).Inker argues that because P/E multiples are still expanding at a time when profit margins are "already as good as we've ever seen," the prospects for upside surprises to profit growth look "pretty dim" going forward.As for bonds, Inker characterizes the return on U.S. government debt as "horrible" and says corporate debt "is riskier than people are making it out to be, particularly the very low-rated stuff."Inker's picks for the current environment: TIPS, "high-quality" U.S. companies, and emerging-market stocks where reasonable valuations leave room for some upside."High-quality" U.S. stocks mentioned include: JNJ, MCD, WMT, MSFT TIPS ETFs: TIP, VTIP, IPE, SCHP, LTPZ, STPZ, TIPZ, STIP, TPS, TDTT, TDTF, TIPX EM ETFs: EEM, VWO, EDC, EDZ, SCHE, IEMG, EEV, PIE, ADRE, EUM, EET, GMM, EEME, EMCR, DBEM, EWEM, FEM, EMLB, EMSA, EMFT, EMDR High-yield ETFs: HYG, JNK, HYS, HYLD, SJNK, PHB, SJB, ANGL, XOVR, UJB, QLTC Nov. 16, 2013, 10:08 PM | 4 Comments

Long-time Pharmacyclics bull says near-term off-label ibrutinib use may be curtailed
Wedbush's Gregory Wade, an bull from way back, strikes a slightly more cautious tone on Pharmacyclics (PCYC +1.4%), removing the shares from the Best Ideas list a day after ibrutinib won FDA approval in MCL."While subsequent compendium listings ... in RR CLL/SLL may lead to a change to this policy, we expect the absence of support of about $8900/patient contribution under Medicare Part D payment to be a significant barrier to the near-term use of the drug in the larger off-label settings," Wade says, adding that "there's a good amount of off-label expectations baked into some of the Street's expectations."Outperform rating is maintained. Price target is $165.Concerns about the drug's cost seem warranted. At $90+ per pill, Imbruvica will cost around $130K/year.

Elan is holding an investors' meeting today, where shareholders are due to vote on four proposals, including a share $200M buyback, a drug spin-off and a series of acquisitions. A vote in favor of any of the resolutions would void an offer of up to $8B from U.S. investment firm Royalty Pharma. Elan put itself up for sale on Friday, but still refused to engage with Royalty over the weekend, much to the latter's frustration. One imagines that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) must be pleased to be well out of it, having last week sold the rest of its ADRs in Elan for $332.5M.

Amgen's (AMGN) blockbuster Enbrel drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis, which generated sales of $4.23B last year, is no more effective than a combination of three generic treatments, a study shows. While a regimen that includes Enbrel costs $25,000 a year per patient, the "triple therapy" costs just $1,000. The research didn't examine similar drugs from AbbVie (ABBV) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), although many doctors consider them to be equivalent to Enbrel. Despite the study, researchers feel that the branded treatments might be too well ensconced to be quickly replaced. Jun. 12, 2013, 3:08 AM | 4 Comments
