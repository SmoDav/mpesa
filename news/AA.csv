Better than expected Q2 for Alcoa's metal business eases post-split concerns
"Alcoa's (AA +5.3%) above consensus Q2 results indicate that the mining and smelting business to be separated from the sexier supplier of space-age parts for jets and cars may have a better future than many expected.In Alcoa's latest earnings report, the upstream units outperformed analyst estimates even after prices for aluminum fell 11% from a year earlier, a finding that Morningstar's Andrew Lane says ""should soften concerns about how well the upstream segments will stand on their own two legs after the split.â€ùAlcoaâ€™s upstream segments topped Cowen analyst Anthony Rizzutoâ€™s estimate for adjusted EBITDA by $101M, as the company showed better than expected progress in streamlining.Credit Suisse, which reiterates an Outperform rating and $13 price target on AA shares, maintains a positive outlook for the Arconic downstream business set to be spun off, and expects stable operating performance from the upstream division, since demand for aluminum remains fundamentally solid, and AA has downsized the risk of aluminum prices through asset rationalization and the expansion of its highly profitable merchant bauxite business.

Alcoa details split plans; to shift some debt to new company
"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) offers further details of its plan to split in two, including moving some debt to its spun-off company in an effort to assist the credit rating of the remaining manufacturing entity.Alcoa will spin off the less-promising businesses into a company that keeps the Alcoa name and would continue trading on the NYSE under the AA symbol, while retaining the businesses that make products for the aerospace, automotive, transportation, and building and construction markets, which will be renamed Arconic and change its ticker symbol to ARNC.Alcoa says at least 80.1% of the spun-off company will be distributed to shareholders and 19.9% of the spun-off smelting business will be owned by Arconic.Alcoa would borrow ~$1B and return â€œa substantial portionâ€ù to Arconic, and Alcoa would get a revolving credit facility of as much as $1.5B; the division of debt and other liabilities is critical in implementing the plan to create a self-sufficient metal-producing company and achieve an investment-grade credit rating at the leaner industrial company that will remain.AA +0.7% premarket.

"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) -1.1% AH after reporting better than expected Q4 earnings but an 18% drop in revenues to $5.25B from $6.38B a year ago, amid sharply lower aluminum prices.Alcoa says revenue in its engineered products and solutions business rose 26% Y/Y to a record $1.41B, including 34% growth in aerospace revenue; its smelting division posted a $40M operating loss, vs. year-ago operating earnings of $267M, as average realized prices fell 30%.Alcoa projects robust global aluminum demand growth, up 6% Y/Y to 60.5M metric tons, and global alumina and aluminum deficits in 2016; the company expects 2016 global aerospace sales to increase 8%-9% Y/Y on continued strong demand for large commercial aircraft and jet engines, while forecasting 1%-4% global production growth in automotive, including 1%-5% growth in North America driven by strong sales.Also says its plan to separate into two publicly traded companies is on track for completion during H2 2016.Citigroup analysts say Alcoa provided disappointing guidance for its downstream business, with after-tax operating income below expectations for the engineered products, transportation and construction, and global rolled products segments.

Alcoa wins an upgrade ahead of Monday's earnings report
"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) fell 2.5% in today's trade and more than 18% for the week ahead of its Q4 earnings report Monday, providing another look at how China's economic slowdown is affecting top industrial firms.In its Q3 earnings report in October, Alcoa cut its 2015 outlook on key Chinese end markets, saying it expected Chinese auto production growth of 1%-2% for 2015, down from its earlier projection of 5%-8% growth; however, it continues to expand in the aerospace sector, and last month announced a $2.5B contract to supply Boeing with multimaterial fasteners for every platform and seat tracks for every 787 Dreamliner.Macquarie today upgraded Alcoa to Outperform from Neutral, saying the market has punished the shares too harshly; upon splitting into two companies later this year, the firm thinks investors ""will find an attractively priced value-add business, with exposure to the aerospace and automotive sectors and a reasonably priced raw material business, with a strong market position.""

CFTC chairman to meet with Alcoa CFO on LME warehouse reform
"CFTC chairman Timothy Massad and Alcoa (AA +1.2%) CFO Bill Oplinger will meet tomorrow to discuss metals warehousing reform and the aluminum company's criticism of the CFTC's intervention in the London Metal Exchange's reform plan.Recent LME reforms have increased the rate at which metal must be delivered out of warehouses, a response to controversial financing deals, and aluminum has flooded the market partly as a result.Alcoa met with the CFTC several times before submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act in June to find out what had caused the CFTC to delay its decision on the LME, but those meetings had been with lower-level staff.

"Goldman: ""Aluminum producers face longest period of pain in a generation"""
"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) fell 5.9% today, perhaps due in part to a new report from Goldman Sachs that predicts aluminum producers face ""the longest period of weak marginal producer margins in a generation,"" and forecasts three- and six-month aluminum prices of $1,500/ton from an earlier view of $1,800, and a 12-month outlook for $1,550/ton vs. $1,900 prior.After accounting for recent output cuts and curtailments, Goldman still projects 2.5M-3M ton surpluses across 2016-19 with market balance difficult to achieve, considering most prior periods of substantial surplus have finished because of an exogenous and major pick-up in global demand, currency and energy costs are deflating, and most of the easy cuts have been made.

Alcoa raises criticism of CFTC over LME warehouse reform
"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) ramps up its criticism of the CFTC's intervention in the London Metal Exchange's warehousing reform plan, challenging the commodity regulator's handling of the issue for a second time in as many months.In a letter late last month, Alcoa general counsel Max Laun called on CFTC chairman Timothy Massad to retract the regulator's decision to delay ruling on the LME application to register as a ""foreign board of trade"" in the U.S.The letter again accused the CFTC of overstepping its authority in attempting to regulate a foreign exchange as it privately pushed for the LME to introduce reforms, including a cap on rents at warehouses.The move shows rising concerns among aluminum producers about the impact of the LME rule changes on prices, which have plunged near or below breakeven for many global smelters.

"Alcoa's transformation continuing, as UBS Upgrades to Buy"
"Alcoa (AA +2.8%) is upgraded to Buy from Neutral with a $14 price target at UBS, which is positive on the company's transformation and expects mid- and downstream growth.UBS likes the significant shift in AA's business to expand its lightweight, multi-material business relative to its traditional upstream commodity base since Klaus Kleinfeld became CEO.The firm believes AA's price multiple could expand over time as less volatile midstream and downstream businesses grow and become a greater portion of the company, especially if aluminum prices continue to remain weak; this growth also would decrease AA's already declining sensitivity to the aluminum price.

"Alcoa (AA +4.3%) jumps to within pennies of its 52-week high following a FT report yesterday that the company will reduce aluminum production in Brazil and move into energy trading.A long drought caused many of Brazil's hydropower dams to dry up, which has helped push up spot energy prices; Alcoa's plan is to take advantage by selling some of the power saved by reducing production for higher profits."
"Brazil's national electricity operator estimates power supplies will drop by up to 6% if reservoir levels, currently at 38% capacity, continue to fall; hydro accounts for more than 70% of Brazilâ€™s energy supplies."

"No wonder top aluminum makers Alcoa (AA) and Rusal are the most vocal opponents of an LME proposal aimed at easing bottlenecks of aluminum stored at warehouses: They've reaped ~$1.4B in revenues from higher fees amid the logjam, WSJ reports.Many analysts say these premiums are likely to shrink from record levels if the new warehouse rules are implemented; lower premiums would hit a stream of revenue aluminum companies have come to rely on since 2010, because prices for the metal itself have languished in recent years.Big banks have attracted most of the scrutiny from regulators because they own warehouses in the LME system, but the pushback from Alcoa underscores how any fallout from changes could reverberate beyond Wall Street.ETF: JJU.

"Alcoa up big after solid Q3, but analysts aren't convinced"
"Alcoa's (AA +4.5%) big gain after its Q3 results beat expectations would have led the Dow Industrials, if it were still a member of the Dow Industrials; analysts, however, arenâ€™t jumping on the bandwagon.Cowen notes that Alcoaâ€™s beat was driven by cost cutting, enabling the company to offset the 3% Q/Q drop in realized aluminum prices.J.P. Morgan remains neutral on the stock, believing ""further efforts to reduce its costs in the upstream and grow the downstream will be hampered by a weak aluminum price environment over the next several years.""The stock isn't particularly cheap, Barclays says; even with the strong Q3, AA is generating annualized EPS/EBITDA of $0.44/$2.7B, translating to a stock trading at 18x EPS and 7x EBITDA, with more downside potential than upside.
