FDA updates nutrition labeling on packaged foods
The FDA has updated and modernized the Nutrition Facts labeling on packaged foods and beverages with the aim of better informing consumers about food choices that support a healthy diet.Key changes:Serving size and number of servings per container are more prominently displayed. Serving size updated to reflect what people actually eat and drink (as compared to the mouse-sized portions previously listed).The daily values for nutrients updated based on new scientific evidence. The daily values reflect amounts to consume or not to exceed. Data for %Daily Value make it easier for consumers to determine how much a nutrient in a serving contributes to a daily diet.Added sugars are now required on the label. Vitamin D and potassium are also required because many consumers fall short of the recommended amounts. Vitamins A & C are no longer required since deficiencies in these vitamins are rare today.Larger manufacturers have until July 26, 2018 to institute the new labeling requirements. Small businesses have an additional year to comply.Related tickers: (XLP)(VDC -0.1%)(FXG -0.6%)(IYK)(PBJ -0.6%)(PSCC -0.7%)(OTCPK:NSRGY -0.4%)(PG -0.2%)(UL -0.2%)(PEP +0.3%)(KO +0.3%)(GIS -0.1%)

Wal-Mart fires a shot across retail on pricing
Grocery store stocks are lower after Reuters reports that Wal-Mart (WMT -1%) is running a pricing test in 1,200 U.S. stores. The company is reportedly putting pressure on consumer packaged goods suppliers in order to protect margins.Consumer names such as Procter & Gamble (PG -0.7%), Church & Dwight (CHD -0.4%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL -1%), Seneca Foods (SENEB), General Mills (GIS -2.3%), Kellogg (K -1.5%) and Kimberly Clark (KMB -0.9%) are all modestly lower on the day.Seeking Alpha gave a heads-up to grocery store investors last week on the WMT development, but the rest of the market seems to be just catching up today. Kroger (NYSE:KR) -3.36%. Smart & Final Stores (NYSE:SFS) -2.42%. Weis Markets (NYSE:WMK) -2.75%. Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) -2.00%. Village Super Market (NASDAQ:VLGEA) -1.82%. Supervalu (NYSE:SVU) -1.15%.Target (NYSE:TGT) is still in positive territory with a 0.15% gain, but could also feel an impact from Wal-Mart pricing initiative. Look for that question on the Target earnings call tomorrow.A prolonged effort by Wal-Main to gain market share through basement pricing could create even more ripples in the retail sector and give Amazon (AMZN +0.8%) something to think about.Retail ETFs: XLY, XRT, VCR, RTH, RETL, IYK, FXD, FDIS, RCD, PMR, UGE, SZK, CNDF, FTXD, JHMC.

Procter & Gamble at two-year high after Trian steps in
Procter & Gamble (PG +2.9%) trades at a two-year high after investors bet that the emergence of Trian as a +$3B stakeholder will ratchet up pressure on the company to cut costs.Some investment firms also think the Trian factor brings the P&G break-up option back into the mix."While P&G has taken sensible steps to enhance shareholder value recently, the perceived value of a P&G break-up is likely to re-emerge," advises Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy.P&G traded as high as $91.10 before peeling back a bit.Previously: Procter & Gamble +4% on report of big Trian stake (Feb. 14) Wed, Feb. 15, 12:04 PM | 9 Comments

Here are some Trump stocks - Barron's
Barron's speaks with several prominent money managers.They are hopeful that Donald Trump will enact pro-growth tax and fiscal-stimulus policies, while avoiding overly protectionist measures.Even though biotech stocks have already rallied 10%, fund manager Arun Daniel believes that the benefits of a Trump administration on the bottom lines of biotech and drug companies are not yet fully priced in.  ETFs: IBB, XBI, BIB, BBH, FBT, HQL, PBE, BIS, LABU, BBC, BBP, CNCR, LABD, UBIO, ARKG, ZBIO, LABSHe's also bullish on stocks leveraged to government-backed infrastructure spending, his favorites being Jacobs Engineering (NYSE:JEC) and Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM).Some companies will likely be allowed to repatriate billions of dollars of profits at a low tax rate. Major beneficiaries could include Nike (NYSE:NKE), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).Neuberger Berman's Joseph Amato says that a Trump administration will be better for stocks than bonds. "If [Trump] takes a measured approach and gets some level of concessions for U.S. workers, the trade concerns may be much ado about nothing," Amato says. "But that's a big if."

The company additionally plans to cut back advertising on lesser-reach digital properties.The news comes as Facebook earlier today introduced improved ad-control customization and ad-blocking initiatives.Targeted advertising is a distinct and major feature of Facebook's revenue model and with this new approach by a major global partner, it will be interesting to see if others begin to adopt comparably more broad-based strategies.Nonetheless, Facebook is adept at building profitable advertising structures for large and small companies alike and while this slight pushback is notable, the company will look to address these concerns and adjust accordingly.

Consumer product giants eye disruption after Dollar Shave Club buyout
Unilever (UL, UN) confirms it acquired Dollar Shave Club. The company didn't disclose the transaction price, but earlier reports pegged it at $1B which would make the deal the third largest buyout in the e-commerce space ever after Zulilly and Wayfair. The transaction is also an exclamation point on the disruption that Dollar Shave Club achieved in a consumer products category once considered nearly impenetrable.The innovative shaving club sends razors directly to members for as little as $1 per month. Dollar Shave Club is on track to top $200M in turnover this year and has 3.2M members.Earlier this week, news broke that Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is increasing its testing of online subscriptions. It's a trend to watch for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), and Edgewell Personal Care (NYSE:EPC).Previously: Fortune: Unilever buys Dollar Shave Club for $1B (July 20) Jul. 20, 2016, 8:48 AM | 11 Comments

Procter & Gamble (PG -0.3%) is testing an online subscription service for Tide Pods as it continues to slowly analyze the potential impact of a direct-to-consumer model.Last year, P&G introduced the Gillette Shave Club in an effort to match the upstart Dollar Shave Club. The late break by the company allowed the Dollar Shave Club to grow to 3.2M members.Though a significant shift could be years away, a push by Procter toward selling a higher mix of products through online subscription services could have an impact on retailers such as Target (TGT -0.2%), Wal-Mart (WMT), and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA -0.2%). It could also be a positive development for FedEx (FDX -0.5%) and UPS (UPS -0.4%). Jul. 19, 2016, 11:26 AM | 13 Comments

Companies drifting into the sweet spot of retail
Economists think that the combination of a stronger U.S. jobs environment and sub-$2 gas prices could improve some consumer spending habits, although not as much for traditional big box retailers, apparel chains, and electronics stores as for specialty retailers selling lower-end personal care, housing, and decor items. Though middle-income and low-income consumers continue to be thrifty with major purchases (logo apparel, gadgets), there have been signs in recent earnings reports of strength in everyday items such as shampoo, mattresses, and underwear.That trend could benefit a variety of chain stores with an U.S. focus including Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE), Ulta Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), Kirkland's (NASDAQ:KIRK), Sally Beauty Holdings (NYSE:SBH), Michaels Companies (NASDAQ:MIK), Party City (NYSE:PRTY), and even Mattress Firm (NASDAQ:MFRM).The bump in consumer staples spending could provide a lift to Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) as well for the U.S. side of their business.Related ETFs: XLP, VDC, FXG, RHS, FSTA, PSL, PSCC Dec. 4, 2015, 10:29 AM | 5 Comments

Procter & Gamble executive shakeup puts Taylor in lead for CEO post
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has broadened the responsibilities of senior exec David Taylor, the company's chief of global health and grooming, making him a front-runner to eventually succeed CEO A.G. Lafley.Taylor will take over PG's troubled global beauty unit, effectively giving him control of businesses that generate more than 40% of the company’s revenue.The beauty business was the weakest of PG’s five main operating units in the fiscal year that ended in June, with sales falling 2% and the only unit to post a decline; sales fell 1% in the September quarter.However, PG did not give Taylor a title that could more firmly establish an executive as next in line to be CEO, indicating he still has work to do to secure the job.The former head of the beauty business, Deb Henretta, will move to a newly created role overseeing the global online business; she was among a small pool of contenders to succeed the 67-year-old Lafley, but the changes suggest she may be out of the running.

A win for Dish and consumers, a loss for programmers
Dish Networks (DISH -0.2%) won a significant court battle in L.A. against Fox Broadcasting over the company's Dish Anywhere app.The ruling from a federal judge applied some of the principles from the Supreme Court's look at the Aereo case.The opinion from the court indicated that watching content on mobile devices and tablets through Dish Anywhere doesn't qualify as a breach of copyright law.The use of Dish's PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop features were also deemed as fair use.Many programmers seemed to have anticipated the legal decision and already negotiated with Dish to disable ad-skipping for a period of time after a show airs.The ruling is sure to have been noticed on Madison Avenue where the largest (and smarter?) ad spenders continue to increase digital spending over broadcast/cable TV buys.Big advertisers: MCD, PG, BUD, WMT, TGT, K, GIS, TM, GM.Programmers: CBS, TWX, FOXA, SNI, AMCX, VIA , VIAB, DISCA.

FDA gives thumbs up to new sugar substitute
The U.S. regulator approves advantame, the sixth sugar substitute to get the agency's blessing. It can used as a tabletop sweetener or as an ingredient in cooking by virtue of its stability at high temperatures.The approval was based on the results of 37 animal and human studies submitted by the manufacturer.Advantame is chemically similar to aspartame (Equal). People with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria have difficulty metabolizing phenylalanine, a component of both aspartame and advantame. Food containing aspartame must be labeled as such. The amount of advantame needed to achieve a similar level of sweetness as aspartame is much less so no special labeling will be required.The last sweetener cleared by the FDA was neotame (Newtame) in 2002.Just a few related tickers: (PG) (PEP) (KO) (GIS) (K) May 20, 2014, 7:15 PM | 9 Comments

Procter & Gamble's (PG) Gillette is set to launch a new high-end razor called the ProGlide FlexBall, which incorporates a swiveling ball-hinge that enables the blade to pivot, the WSJ reports.

Vermont nears passage of GMO food labeling law
In a 28-2 vote, the Vermont Senate passes a bill that will require packaged food makers to label their products that contain genetically modified organisms ((GMOs)). If the State House of Representatives approves the Senates' changes to the version it passed before sending it the upper chamber, then the law will take effect July 1, 2016.Vermont will be the first U.S. state to institute such mandatory labeling.Predictably, food manufacturers oppose the bill saying GMOs are ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. The most popular GMO crops are corn, soybeans and canola which are found in almost every kind of packaged food. They say that GMOs are safe and the law, if enacted, will add unnecessary costs and complications for farmers and the food industry.Consumer groups believe more safety testing needs to be done by independent researchers.Vermont's bill would make it illegal to label a food product containing GMOs as "natural" or "all natural".(MON) (PG)ETFs: PBJ Apr. 17, 2014, 8:25 AM | 8 Comments
