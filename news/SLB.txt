Halliburton has plenty of reasons to seek Aker Solutions, analyst says
Reports that Halliburton (HAL -2.2%) is near a deal to buy Aker Solutions are dismissed by Aker ASA, RBC analyst Kurt Hallead sees some compelling reasons why HAL might be interested in the Norwegian oil services company.Aker would give HAL a similar product suite as chief competitors Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) and Baker Hughes (BHI -0.3%)/General Electric (GE -1.2%), Hallead says, adding that a deal could make sense from a competitive framework but that HAL has never indicated that it felt subsea was a missing piece to its product and service offering.

Energy share losses push ETF below 200-day MA as crude oil sinks
Widespread losses in energy stocks today pushed the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE) below its 200-day moving average for the first time since April.The XLE slumped 2.6% in today's trade as 32 of the 37 ETF members fell, with some of the worst losses from MRO -8.6%, MUR -6.7%, DVN -6.5%, CHK -6.1% and NBL -5%; also XOM -1.7%, CVX -1.9%, COP -3.8%.Among other energy movers included: SLCA -8.3%, RSPP -5.2%, CXO -5.2%, PXD -5%, EOG -4.7%, FANG -4.6%, SLB -2.3%.Refiners fared relatively well: VLO +1.9%, MPC +0.1%, TSO +0.3%, PSX -0.3%.Crude oil slumped more than 5% to the lowest close this year after data showed production cuts from OPEC and other producers have not been enough to reduce U.S. supplies.Today's plunge puts oil on a path to test the December low of $49.95/bbl, Again Capital founding partner John Kilduff tells CNBC, with all the pieces in place for crude oil to break below its three-month range: lack of cohesion among OPEC members, bearish statements from oil ministers at the CERAWeek conference, and subdued refinery activity.Other ETFs: VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, FCG, ERY, GASL, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, FENY, IEZ, PXE, GASX, PXI, FIF, PXJ, RYE, NDP, GUSH, DRIP, DDG, FXN, CRAK

Schlumberger set to bring back Galuccio after leading Argentina’s YPF
Schlumberger (SLB +0.7%) is preparing to add former Latin American energy CEO Miguel Galuccio to its board, hoping his previous experience may help in navigating a challenging economic picture in the region.Galuccio, named in SLB’s proxy materials, worked 13 years for the company where he created a successful production model - tested first in Latin America - that tied customer pay to how much the company improved production - before taking the helm at Argentina’s YPF in 2012.Galuccio's impending return comes as SLB faces payment delays on $1.2B from Venezuela's national oil company, and Bloomberg reports that he has been asked to advise the company on how best to proceed on Venezuela going forward.SLB will hold its annual meeting on April 5 in Curacao, when Galuccio’s nomination is one of 12 that will be voted on.

Bloomberg: Lots of lost oil jobs will not return, as robots take over rigs
A third to a half of the 440K energy sector jobs lost in the global oil industry collapse may never come back, as a combination of more efficient drilling rigs and increased automation is reducing the need for field hands, which will hamper Pres. Trump's promises for a flood of new energy sector jobs, according to a Bloomberg report.Rigs have become so much more efficient that the shale industry can use about half as many as it did at the height of the boom in 2014 to amass the same oil output; for example, Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), the world’s largest onshore driller, says it expects to cut the number of workers at each well site eventually to about five from 20 by deploying more automated drilling rigs.Companies were too busy pumping oil and gas to worry about head count during the boom, the downturn gave them time to rethink the mix of human labor and automated machinery in the oil fields, says Evercore ISI's James West.Relevant tickers include SLB, HAL, BHI, NOV, FTI, RIG, NE, ATW, DO, RDC, ESV, HP, PTEN, SDRL.

Halliburton CEO sees North America revenue growth beating rig count rise
Halliburton (HAL -2.6%) remains lower following Q4 results that disappointed investors who believe the company did not benefit from the rebound in U.S. drilling activity as much as expected.HAL's Q4 North American revenue rose 9% Q/Q and but fell 16% from a year earlier, while rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. jumped nearly 20% in Q4 and have climbed another 5% YTD.In today's earnings conference call, CEO Dave Lesar said HAL's North American revenue growth lagged the increase in rig count because the company elected to forgo unprofitable contracts, but that the growth this year would meet or beat the increase in the number of drilling rigs.The CEO also said oilfield service prices would increase by more than 10% this year, a higher rate than most E&P companies expect; after crude prices rally, companies will demand equipment and crews at a certain location and at a specific time, resulting in shortages, Lesar predicts."Animal spirits have broken free and they are running," according to Lesar. "Customers are excited again and our conversations have changed from being only about cost control to how we can meet their incremental demand."It's a down day for oil services stocks across the board: SLB -2.5%, BHI -0.9%, NOV -1.6%, NBR -3.2%, HP -1.5%, PTEN -4.2%, FTI -1.9%, HLX -3.8%, OII -2.4%, PDS -1.9%.

Schlumberger sees international oil spending picking up later this year
Energy prices and production likely will increase this year after hitting bottom but without a "dramatic" short-term recovery in international markets, compared with North America where shale producers already are ramping up drilling activity, Schlumberger (SLB -0.9%) CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in today's earnings conference call.SLB sees E&P investments in North America rising by 30% this year, with the biggest growth in the Permian Basin, "which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing," the CEO says.But SLB shares are lower, as the company is "a little bit less exposed to onshore North America than others," Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai tells Bloomberg. "There will be a little bit slower international recovery, and given Schlumberger is more international, they’ll benefit a little less near term."Kibsgaard says SLB has begun renegotiating prices with clients but "we need significantly higher pricing before we get into a sustainable operating environment," signaling that oil producers will need to continue to rely more on innovation and efficiencies.SLB peers are trading mixed: HAL +1.3%, BHI -0.2%, FTI -0.3%.

Schlumberger's Q4 revenue beats on growth in North America activity
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) -0.3% premarket after reporting in-line Q4 earnings and a slight revenue beat, and the company says it expects energy prices and production will increase.SLB says Q4 revenue from North America rose 4% Q/Q to $1.77B, with revenue from U.S. onshore operations rising by double digits in percentage terms due to "higher activity and a modest pricing recovery," while revenue from international markets rose 1% Q/Q to $5.28B.SLB's production unit revenue gained 5% Q/Q due to increased hydraulic fracturing activity in the Middle East and in North America land, reservoir characterization revenue rose 1% due to strong testing and process activity in Kuwait, and drilling revenue came in flat.Q4 pretax operating margin was flat Q/Q at 11.4%, as margin improvements in production and drilling were balanced by contractions in the Cameron and reservoir characterization units.For full-year 2017, SLB expects $2.2B in capex, compared with $2.1B last year.

Schlumberger buys flow control specialist Peak Well Systems
Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) continues where it left off last year with the acquisition of Scotland-based Peak Well Systems, a specialist in the design and development of advanced downhole tools for flow control and well integrity, for an undisclosed sum.SLB says the addition of Peak’s mechanical and remedial solutions for cased-hole well intervention strengthens its production services portfolio with a broader offering of mechanical services to its global customers.SLB last year agreed to acquire drilling services units controlled by Canadian company Xtreme Drilling and Coil Services Corp., and closed on a merger with industry counterpart Cameron International.

GE-Baker Hughes combo has potential but "a long-term game," Bernstein says
The combination of General Electric's (GE +0.8%) oil and gas business with Baker Hughes (BHI +0.4%) has the potential to challenge Schlumberger (SLB +0.2%), but "it's a long-term game," Bernstein analysts say.Following yesterday’s investor meeting, the Bernstein boys say they are more convinced by the merger's long-term potential but remain cautious on delivery timing; while the long-term potential and revenue enhancement concepts dominated the meeting, the firm says little information was revealed on timing beyond the already published synergy estimates.Bernstein agrees conceptually with management that GE-BHI will challenge SLB for large-scale, integrated, at-risk projects and leadership of new commercial models in E&P, but expects implementation will prove more challenging than conveyed at the investor meeting.

Stephens' favorite oil services stocks: BHI, NBR, SLB, OII, SPN, FTK
Stephens analysts say “structurally oversupplied crude markets will take more time to balance” even with an OPEC production cut, which makes them reiterate support for their top six picks among oil services stocks: Baker Hughes (BHI +6.4%), Nabors Industries (NBR +22.8%), Schlumberger (SLB +5.2%), Oceaneering International (OII +6.8%), Superior Energy Services (SPN +17.8%) and Flotek Industries (FTK +13.6%).The firm says the companies "tend to have market leadership, stable balance sheets and/or cash flows, differentiated/diverse products or services or product line leadership.”Stephens says a production cut and follow-through could justify its base case to high case range for oil averaging $52/bbl in 2017 and $54/bbl in 2018, with low and high cases ~$10/bbl higher or lower in each year.

Energy stocks slide alongside crude oil in early trading
Crude oil continues to slide - WTI now -3.8% at $45.27/bbl, and Brent -3.8% at $46.40/bbl - dragging oil and gas equities (XLE -2.1%) down with it.Iran's oil minister says he is not prepared to reduce supply, and Saudi Arabia says it would not participate in a production deal without Iran and Iraq.Reuters reports that Iran has written to OPEC saying Saudi Arabia needs to cut oil output to 9.5M bbl/day; Saudi has said it was prepared to reduce its production only by 500K bbl/day from current levels of 10.5M.In early trading: XOM -1%, CVX -1.7%, RDS.A -1.4%, BP -1%, TOT -0.3%, STO -1.8%, PBR -3.7%, COP -2.9%, MRO -4%, APC -2.8%, DVN -2.7%, HES -3.6%, ENB -2.3%, PSX -1.2%, MPC -0.8%,  SLB -2.2%, HAL -2.3%, BHI -2.1%, KMI -1.4%, EPD -2%, ETP -2.2%, WMB -2.4%, SE -2.3%, CHK -2.6%.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, FCG, ERY, GASL, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, FENY, IEZ, PXE, GASX, FIF, PXJ, RYE, NDP, GUSH, DRIP, DDG, FXN, CRAK Nov. 29, 2016, 10:20 AM | 56 Comments

Ophir signs deal with Schlumberger-Golar JV for Equatorial Guinea project
British oil and gas explorer Ophir Energy (OTCPK:OPGYF) says it signed an agreement with OneLNGSM, a joint venture between units Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Golar LNG (NASDAQ:GLNG), to develop the Fortuna project in Equatorial Guinea.Ophir had said it could move forward without new partners for the Fortuna floating liquefied natural gas project as cost estimates had been cut by half to ~$450M and after SLB had walked away from the deal in June, but analysts say SLB's return to the project would be viewed positively by the market.Ophir says it will own a 33.8% stake in the JV, while OneLNG will own the rest; a final investment decision is expected in H1 2017 with first gas in H1 2020.

Buy Baker Hughes now that the GE dust has settled, Guggenheim says
It's time to buy Baker Hughes (BHI -0.2%) now that the dust has settled regarding the company's merger with General Electric's (GE +0.6%) oil and gas business, Guggenheim analysts say.Guggenheim estimates the new company will generate $4.9B in EBITDA in 2018 - a bit less than the $5.2B-$5.5B forecast by the companies - and should trade at a peer average 10.6x EBITDA, implying a fair value for BHI of ~$63, but the firm believes synergies provide another ~$4 of upside if GE is able to realize greater cost savings.The firm also finds the industrial logic is sound: As Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) has shown, regional and product line diversity enhance through-cycle returns and cash flow, which are benefits that the new BHI should be able to realize as a result of its pro forma portfolio.

Crude oil, energy stocks crushed after historic inventory surge
Oil prices and energy equities plunged sharply as the latest inventory data showed U.S. stockpiles posted the largest weekly surge in 34 years, after the consensus outlook had pointed to only a modest rise.WTI crude oil -2.9% to settle at $45.34/bbl, its lowest since Sept. 27, and Brent crude -2.7% to $46.86, also its lowest since late September.“You could easily make the argument it’s the most bearish report of all time,” says Bob Yawger, director of the futures division of Mizuho Securities USA. “There’s nothing to support the market.”WTI, which already was turning lower in recent days, has now fallen 12% in just two weeks since hitting a one-year high on Oct. 19 and marks the third retreat from $50/bbl toward $40 within five months.Among individual stocks: XOM -0.1%, CVX -0.9%, RDS.A -2%, BP -0.2%, TOT -2.4%, COP -0.6%, MRO -3.6%, HES -1.3%, PSX -2.3%, MPC -3.4%, VLO -1.9%, SLB -1%, HAL -0.5%.ETFs: USO, OIL, XLE, UWTI, UCO, VDE, ERX, DWTI, OIH, SCO, XOP, BNO, DBO, ERY, DIG, DTO, USL, DUG, BGR, IYE, IEO, FENY, DNO, PXE, FIF, OLO, PXJ, RYE, SZO, NDP, GUSH, DRIP, DDG, FXN, OLEM Nov. 2, 2016, 3:56 PM | 90 Comments
Baker Hughes, GE shares head in opposite directions as deal sinks in
Baker Hughes (BHI -1%) erases opening gains to trade in the red, while General Electric (GE +0.9%) is higher amid plans to combine their oil and gas operations.The new company will be 62.5% owned by GE, with GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli serving as President and CEO; GE will fund a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50/share, or $7.4B, to existing BHI shareholders, who will own 37.5% of the new company.The deal creates a company with more than $32B in FY 2015 revenue that could cut costs to better compete with rivals such as Schlumberger (SLB -0.9%) to provide equipment and services to oil rigs and wells; the $32B combined revenue places the new company only 8%-9% behind SLB.The combined companies expect to generate $1.6B of synergies by 2020, primarily driven by cost savings; GE expects the deal to be accretive to 2018 EPS by $0.04 and 2020 EPS by $0.08.Analysts see a high likelihood of the deal's completion given little product overlap outside of the Artificial Lift business and the relatively smaller size of the deal vs. the rejected Halliburton-Baker Hughes (HAL -0.5%) tie-up.Moody’s, Fitch and S&P all affirmed GE’s credit ratings with stable outlooks following the announcement.

Schlumberger CEO Kibsgaard sees early signs of recovery in most markets
Schlumberger (SLB -2.7%) says it sees early signs of recovery in the oil drilling industry activity in most parts of the world, after reporting mixed Q3 results that were helped by improved North American activity."The only place where we don't see any signs of recovery at this stage is in Asia", CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in today's earnings conference call, adding that he expects solid growth in the Middle East and Russia in 2017, and that he has seen a slight uptick in investment and activity in Latin America, Europe and Africa."It is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past two years," Kibsgaard said on the call, and recent oil price gains had strengthened its negotiations with customers, but there were no "material movements" on pricing during Q3.SLB said it is looking to gain market share in onshore North America, as demand for its high-end drilling technologies was rising with more oil companies looking to drill longer laterals; at the same time, it warns that the fracking market continued to be oversupplied with a "large number of very hungry players."

Schlumberger posts mixed Q3 but says North America activity coming back
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) -0.4% AH after Q3 earnings beat expectations but fell 82% Y/Y on 17% less revenue and increased expenses related to the Cameron acquisition earlier this year.Excluding results from Cameron, SLB says its Q3 land revenue in North America rose 14% Q/Q, attributed to higher drilling and fracturing activity, although pricing improvements were limited as much of the increase in activity was driven by small companies.CEO Paul Kibsgaard says SLB foresees improved activity in onshore North American, Middle Eastern and Russian markets next year, but visibility remains limited since customer spending for 2017 is still in the planning process.SLB's results come a day after rival Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) posted a small Q3 profit that it attributed to U.S. energy company customers starting to return to drilling this summer.

Halliburton posts surprise profit as it "relentlessly" manages costs
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) +0.9% premarket after posting a surprise Q3 profit, as it begins to win back business from oil producers that are beginning to ramp up operations.HAL says sales in its primary North American market gained 9% Q/Q to $1.66B, its first North American sales boost since the downturn began in late 2014, and operating results rose by $58M, which represents 41% incremental margins; CEO Dave Lesar cites improving rig count growth and “relentlessly managing costs."HAL's sales in the U.S. and Canada had plunged by more than two-thirds during the downturn as customers cut spending; despite the Q/Q improvement, Q3 North American sales still were 33% lower than ay ear ago.Lesar, who has talked about a turnaround on the horizon, says HAL is cautious about Q4 activity due to holiday and seasonal weather-related downtimes, but "it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers.”Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) is expected to report next Tuesday.

More than 300 Norwegian oil service workers are on strike after wage talks broke down, hitting operations of subcontractors to the country's oil and gas industry including Schlumberger (SLB +1%), Halliburton (HAL +2.3%), Baker Hughes (BHI +2%) and Oceaneering (OII +1.5%).The conflict will force oil companies to halt drilling of some wells on Norway's continental shelf and later could cut into the country's production of ~2M bbl/day of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids; state-controlled Statoil (STO +0.8%) is Norway's largest oil firm.Brent crude recently was 1.6% higher at $46.58/bbl and WTI had jumped 2.1% to $45, sparked by the strike and API data showing a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories.ETFs: USO, OIL, UWTI, UCO, DWTI, SCO, BNO, DBO, DTO, USL, DNO, OLO, SZO, OLEM Sep. 21, 2016, 10:21 AM | 15 Comments
There's room for upside in oil services stocks
Don't expect too much out of Q3 oil services results, Credit Suisse says. "While an impressive move off the bottom, the U.S. horizontal rig count is still only 31% of its 2014 average. Not going down anymore is fabulous. But it doesn’t translate into doing well very quickly."Still, CS says investors should be more aggressive in buying stocks that miss earnings estimates.Firm notes that the focus on efficiency continues. "Sand has replaced land rigs as the under-utilized fixed-cost-base leveraged play on the recovery." Recommends SLCA and HCLP.Says that technology and a more efficient client base makes HAL the top “demographic” play over SLB in the near term."BHI and WFT are self-help stories in different stages of improvement, but both have reasons to be in energy portfolios. Manufacturing is challenged with its focus on deepwater, which drives FET as our top pick in the group." Sep. 7, 2016, 3:03 AM | 12 Comments
Schlumberger cutting workers, projects in pained Venezuela
With Venezuela dealing with a pained economic crisis, Schumberger (SLB +0.2%) is cutting workers and projects in the country as part of a scaleback it alluded to earlier this year.Employees are being laid off from Maracaibo Lake to the Orinoco Belt. "They're getting rid of almost all the workers because they're reducing operations and the contracts won't be renovated because of debt owed by PDVSA," says one employee.PDVSA is the exclusive operator of oilfields in Venezuela, an OPEC nation.A union leader says 600 workers are being fired in Zulia state (which incorporates Maracaibo), and 2,000 nationally.

Halliburton top oilfield services stock at Evercore on North American strength
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) remains Evercore ISI's “North American Winner” among oilfield services stocks and sees shares hitting $60 in "the not-too-distant future," citing the management team’s "relentless pursuit of efficiency and aggressive positioning for the upcycle."The firm believes HAL is best positioned in the group to benefit from the unfolding increase in oilfield services activity in North America, as it remains markedly more levered to North America than competitors.Once the recovery strengthens, North American activity will react the quickest and the strongest, which Evercore says should allow HAL to enjoy higher company-wide revenue growth and margin expansion than its peers.Yesterday, Guggenheim analysts suggested selling HAL in favor of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), mostly on SLB's discounted valuation.

Schlumberger slips on glum outlook for Q3 drilling work
Schlumberger (SLB -1.9%) is lower after warning in an investor presentation that it expects Q3 results to come in "slightly lower" as West Africa, Brazil and Asia see further declines in deepwater drilling.While SLB has seen more work thanks to an increase in the U.S. rig count, "there has yet to be any material change in pricing" for the service work, president of operations Patrick Schorn said.After the update, RBC analysts cut their EPS estimates for SLB in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to $1.04, $2.89 and $4.48, respectively from $1.18, $2.99 and $4.55, driven by the company's more tepid than expected outlook for the drilling and reservoir characterization segments.

Time to sell Halliburton and buy Schlumberger, Guggenheim says
It’s time to sell Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and buy Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) in "one of the more obvious examples of the valuation disconnect today," Guggenheim analysts say in removing HAL from the firm’s Best Ideas list in favor of SLB.The firm says SLB now trades at a 30% discount to its 10-year average relative multiple vs. HAL on a forward enterprise value/EBITDA basis.While SLB may not have HAL's concentration of U.S. revenue, Guggenheim believes that investors continue to underestimate the incremental earnings contribution that SLB should generate from its data and analytics software, transformation initiatives, integration of Cameron and share repurchases.

Federal offshore chief warns drillers to find solution to subsea bolt failures
The U.S. government's top offshore drilling regulator is warning subsea oil drillers and equipment makers that bolt failures in the Gulf of Mexico could result in an oil spill on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.Regulators and makers of oil production equipment - including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) - are trying to determine what is causing the problems, which have been found over the past four years on safety equipment in underwater oil production, including on blowout preventers, which are designed as a last defense against a major oil spill such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident.The offshore drilling industry had discussed possibly replacing all the bolts in question in the Gulf over a period of years, but Brian Salerno, director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, says the discussions have ended after a better understanding of the problem.GE issued a global recall after its bolts on a piece of undersea equipment in the Gulf of Mexico failed in 2012, an incident that was reported to the government, but government officials say many more were not, masking the extent of the problem.

Baker Hughes CEO says no North America drilling recovery this year
Baker Hughes (BHI +2.6%) is higher despite posting a wider than expected Q2 loss on 39% less revenue Y/Y, as the company says it expects margins to improve across its businesses due to recent job cuts and other restructuring actions.Capital One analyst Luke Lemoine was positive on the results, saying BHI's Q2 "clean" EBITDA came in at ~$61M, close to expectations of $65M, $500M in cost-cutting is on track, and that the company repurchased $500M in shares in the quarter, a third of its buyback program.However, CEO Martin Craighead is less optimistic about Q2 than rivals Schlumberger (SLB -1%) and Halliburton (HAL -0.2%), saying he does not expect a substantial recovery in drilling and pricing in North America this year and that oil prices "in the upper $50s at a minimum are required for a sustainable recovery."BHI cut ~3K jobs in quarter, after eliminating 2K in Q1 and 18K last year.

Schlumberger eyes rolling back pricing concessions
Schlumberger (SLB +0.7%) is higher after Q2 earnings edged analyst consensus and saying it is shifting focus to recovering price concessions made during the depths of the oil bust.CEO Paul Kibsgaard says SLB is renegotiating contracts as oil prices rise from their lows, and warns that prices charged by service companies also must recover to close the widening gap between oil production and demand."Inevitably service industry pricing has to recover and as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity, which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit," Kibsgaard said in today's earnings conference call.Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai sees the appetite to renegotiate as a positive but "it could be a couple of years before pricing really recovers."SLB yesterday joined rival Halliburton (HAL -0.4%) in saying the oil industry appears to have reached the bottom of the cycle, even as market conditions mostly worsened in Q2.

Schlumberger posts unadjusted Q2 loss, cut another 8K jobs
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is flat AH after Q2 earnings and revenues finished slightly ahead of consensus but still registered respective Y/Y declines of 74% and 20%.SLB cut more than 8K jobs during Q2, on top of cuts of 8K jobs in Q1 and another 10K in Q4 2015; the company says its total head count now stands at more than 50K employees, ~40% below its peak in 2014.SLB reported an unadjusted Q2 loss of $2.16B vs. a year-ago profit of $1.12B, as it took a $1.9B non-cash impairment charge and a $646M restructuring charge related to the job cuts.SLB says revenue in its North American business fell 26% Y/Y to $1.74B but rose 19% Q/Q, while international revenue fell 20% Y/Y to $4.36B but added 8% Q/Q."Market conditions worsened further in most parts of our global operations, but in spite of the continuing headwinds we now appear to have reached the bottom of the cycle," CEO Paal Kibsgaard says.SLB provided no additional guidance, saying it would provide information in tomorrow's earnings conference call.

Halliburton CEO Lesar: "We believe the North America market has turned"
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) CEO Dave Lesar says the U.S. rig count bottomed out during Q2, and he expects to see a modest uptick during H2: "We believe the North America market has turned. With our growth in market share during the downturn, we believe we are best-positioned to benefit from any recovery, including a modest one."HAL +0.7% premarket after reporting a lighter than expected Q2 loss on revenues of $3.84B, down 35% Y/Y, but North American revenues fell 15% while the continent’s rig count fell by a steeper 23%; HAL, which derives ~40% of its revenue from North America, is more exposed to the region than rivals Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).The U.S. rig count "reached a landing point" during Q2 after falling 78% from the November 2014 peak, improving by 26 over the past several weeks, "reflecting operator confidence in stabilizing commodity prices."HAL booked $3.52B of costs related to terminating the Baker Hughes merger, as well as $423M of other impairments and charges during the quarter; HAL's unadjusted Q2 net loss was $3.21B, or $3.73/share, vs. a profit of $54M, or $0.06/share, in the year-ago quarter."The outlook was the most important thing," Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai says, since Q2 expectations for HAL were so low.

Six oil services stocks should do well no matter what oil does, analyst says

Report: Concern grows over failure of bolts used to secure subsea oil wells
GE (GE +1.1%), oil drillers and regulators are scrambling to determine why massive bolts used to connect subsea oil equipment keep failing, causing alarm over the safety of hundreds of wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Dow Jones reports.A U.S. investigation and two recent bolt failures have convinced regulators and industry officials that the problem goes beyond GE and its blowout preventers, according to the report; the Interior Department says flaws also have been found in bolts made by National Oilwell Varco (NOV +2.5%) and Schlumberger (SLB +1.3%), and in bolts used in other areas on subsea wells.GE says it is working with the Interior Department to address the problems and has supplied replacement parts to customers upon request.Companies already have begun the process of finding and replacing corroded bolts; Diamond Offshore (DO +1.9%), which has a fleet of 30 rigs, told investors in June that it had four unplanned “stack pulls” in Q2 with three of the repairs involving failed bolts, interruptions that likely will impact Q2 results.

Schlumberger sees "the final approach to a market bottom”
Schlumberger (SLB +1.4%) is higher after saying its financial strength will continue to enable it to invest through the current oil downturn, and it increasingly believes that Q2 may signal the final approach to a market bottom."SLB President of Operations Patrick Schorn said in a presentation at the Wells Fargo West Coast Energy Conference in San Francisco that the latest production data indicate that oil supply and demand are moving fairly rapidly into balance, and may even overshoot as the E&P capex cuts of the past two years continue to impact the industry.While SLB said its overall view had not changed since Q1 earnings, the company provided more color among its product groups, with Q2 Reservoir Characterization revenue expected to decline 10% Q/Q, drilling seen falling by 20%, and production likely to slide 10%.

Land drillers "all look overvalued," Credit Suisse says
Land-based oil drillers "all look overvalued," Credit Suisse analysts say as they downgrade Helmerich & Payne (HP -2.1%), Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN -2%) and Precision Drilling (PDS -4.6%) to Underperform from Neutral, and Nabors Industries (NBR -3.8%) to Neutral from Outperform, predicting current spot rates likely will fall when incremental rigs go to work.Among the group, the firm sees HP as "the worst offender" on valuation, with overly optimistic assumptions for $35K spot market dayrates and forgiveness of deferred tax liabilities still not enough to justify the current price based on its rig count, while NBR is "the relative winner due to its international exposure."The firm prefers Baker Hughes (BHI +0.1%) and Halliburton (HAL -0.1%) in the sector due to their North American exposure and expectations of execution, while Schlumberger (SLB -0.6%) "has valuation headwinds and issues with exploration, deepwater and international exposure, but longer-term exposure to the stock is essential."Now read Moody's: Drillers will be the last to recover in the oil patch (May 16) Jun. 1, 2016, 3:54 PM | 7 Comments

Goldman also likes Halliburton, Nabors in the oil services sector
Schlumberger (SLB +0.1%) is not the only oil services stock Goldman Sachs is touting, as the firm also awards Buy ratings to Halliburton (HAL +1.4%) and Nabors Industries (NBR -0.9%) for their cyclical exposure to the U.S. onshore market.Goldman's commodities and E&P teams say they now see a clearer path for oil production growth in 2017-18, driven by the market becoming balanced by H2 2016 and demand continuing to grow at a healthy pace, with U.S. onshore and Mideast OPEC as the lead drivers of the production growth.The firm likes HAL, SLB and NBR for their cyclical exposure to the U.S. onshore market, and all three have exposure to the Saudi market; HAL and SLB also offer very high leverage to the drilling and uncompleted wells inventory, which sits low on the cost curve and should be the first wells where activity should pick up.

Schlumberger (SLB -1.5%) is maintained with an Outperform rating at Credit Suisse even as the stock's near-term valuation is not highly compelling, but the firm says North American revenue likely will hit bottom during Q2 to mark the end of energy's “worst downcycle in 30 years.”Technology likely will become more critical to revenue growth, market share and pricing as the upcycle unfolds, the firm believes, pointing out that SLB is the technology leader in many lines of business.The bottom of a price and activity cycle has been a proven entry point for SLB - the "largest [oilfield services] company with the highest technology" - and "we see no real difference this time.”At the same time, Cowen analysts raise their SLB price target to $85 from $75, noting the stock held up fairly well even amid weaker than expected guidance, suggesting investors see a bottoming of earnings revisions (Briefing.com).

Schlumberger cut 8K jobs during Q1, CEO says
Schlumberger (SLB -0.4%) eliminated 8K jobs during Q1, CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in today's earnings conference call, bringing the workforce of the world’s largest oil field services company down by nearly one-third since cuts began in late 2014.SLB’s worldwide head count only decreased to 93K from 95K, but the company reclassified 5.5K contractors as permanent employees, so the overall reduction was 8K employees, Kibsgaard clarified.The CEO reiterated his gloomy assessment of the worldwide oil market, calling it "the toughest environment we’ve seen in 30 years and likely to get even tougher before the market turns," and said the company is even evaluating the costs and benefits in some regions “in the event we have to shut everything down."But Kibsgaard also thinks the industry will begin a rebound by 2017, expecting the current oil oversupply "to drop to almost zero by the end of the year” and noting that North America is leading the way in production cuts.FBR Capital reiterates its Outperform rating, saying surprisingly strong non-North America profitability plus stronger EBIT margins across all three international regional divisions outweigh slightly weaker North America margins, believing most investors had written off North America but were apprehensively bracing for SLB's margins internationally; FBR says the international results bolster its confidence in the mitigating force of SLB's ongoing transformation (Briefing.com).Now read Schulmberger earnings slashed but meet estimates; industry "deteriorating" Apr. 22, 2016, 3:57 PM | 1 Comment
Schlumberger earnings slashed but meet estimates; industry "deteriorating"
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) -4.5% AH after Q1 earnings and revenues fell sharply from a year ago, and the company continues to paint a very gloomy near-term picture of the world oil market.SLB says Q1 revenue in its North America business plunged 55% Y/Y and swung to a $10M pretax operating loss from a $416M profit a year ago, while revenue from operations outside North America sank 28% as pretax operating earnings fell to $1.06B from $1.66B a year ago; overall pretax operating margins fell to 13.8% from 19.4%.The company cut another 2K jobs in the quarter, sending global headcount down to ~93K.SLB CEO Paul Kibsgaard says global spending reductions from oil companies are nearing 25% this year with reductions of 40%-50% in North America and 20% internationally.During Q1, "the decline in global activity and the rate of activity disruption reached unprecedented levels as the industry displayed clear signs of operating in a full-scale cash crisis,” Kibsgaard said. "Budgeted E&P spend fell again and substantially affected our operating results.

Wells Fargo analysts say they are sticking with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) as their top picks among oil service stocks even as the proposed merger with Baker Hughes looks increasingly iffy.The firm says it is re-adjusting its rankings with a bias towards large cap names along with high level of conviction towards execution, and expects the market to pay a premium multiple for the best-in-class names in the next multi-year recovery.In order, Wells' favorites in the sector are a stand-alone HAL, Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), U.S. Silica (NYSE:SLCA), Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB); it maintains an Outperform on Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) but moves the stock down in the rankings based on debt concerns and re-investment capacity in a recovery.Now read Schlumberger is Barclays' top pick in North America oilfield services Apr. 20, 2016, 5:45 PM | 17 Comments

Schlumberger is Barclays' top pick in North America oilfield services
Schlumberger (SLB +2.4%) is on the move after being upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $93 price target, raised from $83, at Barclays, which believes that "no company has improved itself more during the downturn than SLB."Naming the company its top pick in the North America Oilfield Services & Equipment group, Barclays also expects SLB's international share to continue growing and its return on invested capital to expand the most among the group.But the firm also thinks a "scarcity premium" has evolved as investors have little to work with in the sector, as the offshore market is several years away from a recovery and liquidity issues are enveloping many of the small and mid caps.The firm views Halliburton (HAL +1.7%) as the "purest way to play the U.S. land recovery" but says "valuation looks a bit stretched post the BHI deal and is highly dependent on higher E&P spending."Barclays also upgrades Superior Energy (SPN +1.6%) to Overweight from Equal Weight and Dril-Quip (DRQ +0.3%) to Equal Weight from Underweight, and downgrades Hornbeck Offshore (HOS +3.6%) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV -1.2%) to Equal Weight from Overweight as well as Pacific Drilling (PACD -1.7%) to Underweight from Equal Weight.Now read Schlumberger shares soared by 20%, but with muted fundamentals Apr. 20, 2016, 2:33 PM | 6 Comments
It's a mixed bag for oil and gas companies in early trade
The energy sector (XLE +0.1%) pokes into the green as crude oil prices pare earlier losses even after the collapse of the Doha meeting, and it's a mixed bag among the top global oil companies in early trading: XOM +0.1%, CVX +0.3%, RDS.A -0.9%, BP -0.3%, TOT -0.4%.Kuwait may have achieved what Doha failed to do, at least in the short term, as a labor strike that began Sunday has cut the country's production by 60%, shuttering 1.7M bbl/day, slightly more than H1's global surplus that caused prices drop to a 12-year low in January.Some oil analysts say the lack of a Doha deal is better for oil prices in the long run now that the rebalancing process of supply and demand can continue to its natural conclusion.Other noteworthy names: KMI -0.1%, CHK -4%, MRO -1.4%, COP +0.1%, SLB +0.2%, HAL +0.2%, BHI -0.7%, OXY +0.5%, APC -0.1%, HES +0.6%, ENB +0.8%, ETP -0.4%, EPD +1.5%.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, FCG, ERY, GASL, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, FENY, IEZ, PXE, PXI, FIF, PXJ, RYE, NDP, GUSH, PSCE, DRIP, DDG, FXN Now read No deal!

Schlumberger trims Venezuela operations on lack of payments
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) says it is cutting back operations in Venezuela, citing delays in payments from the country’s state-run oil company.Venezuela, which holds the biggest oil reserves of any country, has been hit hard by the oil price collapse as most of the government’s revenue comes from petrodollars; the country accounts for more than 10% of SLB’s business.SLB earlier had disclosed an arrangement in which state-run PdVSA transferred over “certain fixed assets” as payment for ~$200M owed.SLB also affirms its Q1 total revenue projection of ~$6.5B.Now read Earnings could cause a drop in Schlumberger's capitalization Apr. 13, 2016, 7:57 AM | 3 Comments
Schlumberger reinstated at Outperform by Credit Suisse on Cameron M&A
Schlumberger (SLB +0.1%) clings to a gain after Credit Suisse resumed coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $80 price target, saying SLB is "exceptionally well positioned to gain share, improve margins, and post higher returns near a cyclical bottom."SLB's just-completed merger with Cameron (NYSE:CAM) makes the company more efficient, integrated and technologically capable and help SLB to shift to a more performance-compensated business model by being present at the wellhead for a longer period of time, Credit Suisse's James Wicklund says.The firm says SLB’s commitment to superior profitability and technology, especially given the backdrop of a company that was able to transform during a down cycle, combined with the company’s wide capabilities, would minimize the impact of any slowing in deepwater and exploration activity.Now read Schlumberger: Don't get your hopes up Apr. 4, 2016, 2:35 PM

Schlumberger’s (NYSE:SLB) $12B takeover of Cameron International (NYSE:CAM) is set to close April 1 after the Chinese Ministry of Commerce cleared the proposed merger without any conditions.China's approval was the last major closing condition to the merger; the U.S. Justice Department signed off on the deal in November, finding that it did not violate antitrust laws.CAM says it is remaining neutral toward SLB's offer to purchase up to $1.2B in aggregate principal amount of CAM's outstanding senior notes in a tender offer in connection with the merger.

Schlumberger sees below-consensus Q1 revenues; shares up anyway
Schlumberger (SLB +1.3%) is higher despite issuing downside Q1 revenue guidance of ~$6.5B, a 15% Q/Q drop and below the $6.94B analyst consensus estimate, with continued weakening in revenues in Q2."The third phase of E&P spending reductions that we are currently experiencing will have a significant impact on our earnings per share in the current and coming quarters," CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in a presentation at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy Conference.The CEO also called for a change in the way the oil and gas industry operates, saying cost reductions by oil and gas producers over the past 18 months were not linked to efficiency improvements, and were the result of pricing concessions from oilfield services providers.Kibsgaard also hinted at more job cuts, saying SLB will continue to match costs and resources to activity; SLB already has cut 34K jobs, or 26% of its workforce, since November 2014.

Price target of $94 (implied upside 29.5%)."Diversified service companies are the best positioned to weather the current commodity cycle and come out stronger on the other side. While large cap companies have always taken share in the downturn, the winners in this cycle not only have to have scale, but also innovative product and process capabilities to improve productivity and increase customer returns.

EU clears Schlumberger's takeover of Cameron

Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is set to gain unconditional approval from the European Union for its $14.8B takeover of equipment maker Cameron International (NYSE:CAM), Reuters reports.Antitrust experts have predicted that the deal would draw minimum scrutiny since the companies offer complementary product lines, while Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) proposed $35B offer for Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) would face a tougher time because of concerns it could push up prices for oil and gas exploration in Europe.U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the deal without conditions last November.

Schlumberger CEO sees no pickup in oilfield activity before 2017
Schlumberger (SLB +5.9%) continues to power higher after reporting better than expected Q4 earnings and launching a new $10B stock buyback program, and Chairman/CEO Paal Kibsgaard says he is "optimistic" that the company is done eliminating jobs now that it has cut more than 25% of its global workforce.Kibsgaard said in today's earnings conference call that he expects oil markets to turn positive in 2016 but does not foresee a significant recovery in oilfield activity until 2017.Guggenheim’s Michael LaMotte and Eric Loyet laud SLB for the "remarkable execution of [SLB's] transformation program - the benefits of which have been the preservation of profitability and free cash flow generation that is greater than the market caps of 95% of the public universe of oil services companies."The analysts note that SLB generated $5B in free cash flow in 2015 and a conversion rate of 114%, and returned $4.6B to shareholders - $2.4B in dividends and $2.2B in share repurchases - and believes 2016 will look much the same.

Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) +0.5% AH after reporting better than expected Q4 earnings but a 39% Y/Y drop in revenue as it faced a continuing decline in rig activity, project delays and cancellations and other problems resulting from lower oil prices.Q4 revenue totaled $7.74B, down from $12.64B in the year-ago period, as revenue in North America plunged 55% Y/Y and revenue for operations outside North America fell 30%.SLB says its cost of revenue fell 35% in Q4, partly the result of cutting 10K jobs in the quarter; it had cut 20K jobs earlier in 2015.SLB expects to close its acquisition of Cameron (NYSE:CAM) by the end of Q1, and says the large stock component - 78% in stock and 22% in cash - insulates the deal from market volatility.SLB also unveils a new $10B share buyback program to replace the 2013 program for the same amount that is nearing completion.

Oilfield services stocks to recover in H2 2016, Oppenheimer says
Crude oil prices likely will stay subdued throughout H1 2016, Oppenheimer's James Schumm says, noting “record pessimism” on futures exchanges and indications from Saudi Arabia that it is preparing for a protracted period of low prices, but he expects oilfield services stocks to recover in H2.Schumm says Halliburton (HAL +0.1%) and Schlumberger (SLB -0.3%) will have an advantage, as their client roster includes the high quality E&P companies whereas smaller oilfield services companies (OIH -0.9%) tend to work for the more marginal players.Oppenheimer also recommends Weatherford (WFT -2.9%), Superior Energy Services (SPN -2.4%), Bristow Group (BRS -2.4%) and Era Group (ERA -5%) in the sector.

Shrinking E&P spending to weigh Transocean, National Oilwell, Citi says
Citigroup analysts expect a nearly 20% drop in spending by E&P companies, which would be bad news for offshore drillers such as Transocean (RIG +1.4%) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV +0.1%), as domestic capex will remain driven by trailing commodity prices and capital raises.The firm prefers Halliburton (HAL +0.5%), along with Baker Hughes (BHI -1.5%), and Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) on franchise quality, exposure to onshore growth longer term and valuations which discount an inability to generate excess returns; it rates all three stocks as Buys.At the same time, Citi remains cautious on the offshore levered companies, especially Sell-rated NOV, given downside risk to EPS estimates, and Sell-rated RIG, given displacement risk and debt maturities.

Continued sluggish oil exploration to weigh on oil services, analyst says
Susquehanna analysts suspect that international oil exploration will be even weaker than expected, prompting them to reduce estimates for oil services companies Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).The firm expects activity levels to steadily drift lower in 2016, as national oil companies and international companies slow spending in order to manage cash flows; NOCs generally operate on annual budgets that are not typically subject to much revision, so the larger international operators will be looking for a sustained move higher in oil prices before ramping up spending and activity levels, Susquehanna says.The firm's 2016 EPS forecast for SLB slips to $2.50 from $2.78, for WFT falls to a loss of $0.60 from a loss of $0.51, for BHI to a loss of $0.17 from a loss of $0.16, and for HAL to $1.16 from $1.17.

Schlumberger (SLB -0.9%) calls off its $1.7B deal for a stake in Eurasia Drilling, Russia’s largest onshore drilling firm, after Russia's government failed to approve the deal by the company's deadline.The decision comes after SLB warned last week that it would not extend the latest of several deadlines for Russian anti-monopoly officials to approve the offer.A successful deal would have helped strengthen SLB's reach in Russia and given it a base from which to grow in the region, but the company still provides services to oil companies operating there even as sanctions have sharply reduced Western investment in the country.

Oil services down cycle "the worst ever," analyst says
Cowen analyst James Crandell thinks the current down cycle in oil is "the worst ever" in terms of magnitude of the decline in exploration and production spending and thus in its impact on oil services companies (NYSEARCA:OIH); unlike past cycles, Crandell says there is a growing realization that a strong recovery in oil prices is not likely.Crandall estimates that when all is said and done, the 2015-16 down cycle will see a decline in global E&P spending of 35%-40%, with a drop internationally of 30% and in North America of 50%.The analyst cuts his price target on Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) to $56 from $61, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) to $38 from $40, and Schlumberge (NYSE:SLB) to $90 from $100, but raises his target on Cameron International (NYSE:CAM) to $65 from $51.

Schlumberger upgraded to Buy at Citigroup

West Texas crude oil surged 8.8% to $49.19/bbl, capping a three-day rally that added more than 27% to the price - the largest three-day rally since January 2009 - after U.S. oil production data showed output falling and OPEC said it would talk with other producers about low prices.Brent crude rallied 7.4% to $53.80, as the spread between the two benchmarks widened to more than $5 intraday after narrowing to $4.33."Oil markets are hungry for any evidence of a fall in production, anywhere,” says Global Hunter's Robert Hastings.The SPDR Energy ETF (XLE +1.2%) jumped after being down as much as 2.5% early in the day, and the Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH +2.3%) reversed a 2.6% loss at its intraday low.However, trading volumes were lower and volatility perhaps greater than usual due to a U.K. holiday.Andrew Keene tells CNBC he is selling today's pop, noting that XLE is again trading at its 20-day MA and "we haven't traded above this moving average since May."Among the shares of some of the more active energy companies, Chevron (CVX +0.5%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.4%) are higher after respective early losses of 3.1% and 2.4%; also, COP +5%, PSX +2.6%, SLB +2.2%, RIG +4.1%, HAL +2.4%, WLL +8.3%, MRO +3.4%, NFX +5.1%, LINE +5.7%.Other ETFs: VDE, ERX, XOP, ERY, FCG, DIG, GASL, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, FENY, PXE, PXI, FIF, PXJ, NDP, RYE, FXN, DDG Aug. 31, 2015, 3:49 PM | 41 Comments
Cameron unlikely to see bidder top Schlumberger, analyst says
Schlumberger (SLB +2.7%) is offering more than $66 in cash and stock per share while takeover target Cameron International’s (CAM +2.5%) private market value may be only $63, according to Gabelli analysts who lower their recommendation on CAM to Hold from Buy.The firm says arbitrageurs can earn a respectable ~10% annualized return on the deal, assuming a successful close by the end of Q1 2016 and given the current $3.62 deal spread.However, the firm believes the deal makes strategic sense for both companies, combining SLB’s subsurface and wellbore expertise with the largest surface technology and second-largest subsea equipment manufacturer, and expects the deal will close with minimal regulatory scrutiny.

Halliburton believers could win big by betting on Baker Hughes deal
Traders willing to bet Halliburton's (HAL +1.4%) proposed deal for Baker Hughes (BHI +1.2%) can survive regulatory scrutiny stand to amass more than $3B in profit, and Schlumberger’s (SLB +1.9%) purchase of Cameron International (CAM +1.7%) could help their chances, according to a Bloomberg analysis.With SLB - already the world’s largest oilfield-services provider - getting even bigger, HAL and BHI could have a better argument that they need to merge to get stronger, and the deal could provide more incentive for contractors to bid on HAL and BHI assets as they seek to stay competitive; HAL and BHI have committed to divest as much as $7.5B in assets, and several buyers appear to be interested.HAL shares stand to drop sharply without a deal, it would not have the merger’s cost-cutting opportunities to shield it from the slump in oil prices and shrinking revenue, and it would have to pay a $3.5B breakup fee if the deal fails to gain regulatory approval.

No recovery for oil services before 2017, analyst says
J.P. Morgan analyst Sean Meakim sees no recovery for oil services companies before 2017 at the earliest, anticipating a protracted period of fits and starts in activity before the sector’s overcapitalization is sufficiently eased through consolidation and attrition.Although the next 4-6 quarters likely will be extremely painful for the sector, Meakim thinks the more pain endured in the near term means more gain will be available for the survivors in the eventual next up-cycle.JPM's top picks in the group include Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Cameron (NYSE:CAM), MRC Global (NYSE:MRC) and Superior Energy Services (NYSE:SPN), while its top Underweights include Ensco (NYSE:ESV), Noble (NYSE:NE) and Transocean (NYSE:RIG).

Schlumberger’s bid for Cameron makes sense, analysts say
Analysts say Schlumberger’s (SLB -4.2%) acquisition of Cameron International (CAM +41.7%) is not particularly surprising, given SLB's two years of experience working alongside CAM through their OneSubsea joint venture and track record of soaking up JV partners.The combination effectively allows the two companies to extract the type of cost savings found at OneSubsea across the rest of their businesses; SLB thinks it can find pretax benefits of $600M in the second year after the deal, most of which will come from cost-cutting.Citigroup says the deal will firmly establish SLB as the dominant and most diversified oilfield service provider, with total estimated revenues for the combined entity of $46B in 2015, a figure the prospective Halliburton (HAL +2.3%) and Baker Hughes (BHI +2.5%) combo cannot match.SLB is making a strategic bet on a recovery in deepwater drilling, even if not in 2016, Tudor Pickering says; with 7M-plus bbl/day of global oil production coming from deepwater reservoirs, it makes sense that offshore activity eventually will rebound.The deal is not likely to touch off an M&A wave in the oilfield services industry because the global crude slump has strained the finances of many companies, leaving few able to make such a move, says Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai.But several potential acquisition targets in the services industry are higher: OII +8.3%, DRQ +7.4%, FTI +6.5%, NOV +4.1%, FET +3%.

Bloomberg: Russia's security service stalling Schlumberger deal
Russia’s Federal Security Service is holding up Schlumberger’s (NYSE:SLB) acquisition of a 46% stake in Eurasia Drilling, concerned that the company would have too much influence in Russia’s oil services market, according to a Bloomberg report.The deal needs approval from a 21-member commission on foreign investment, which reviews major acquisitions in areas of the economy deemed strategic; members include the FSB head, defense minister and deputy prime minister.SLB offered to buy the Eurasia stake for $1.7B in January, with an option to acquire the rest of Russia’s largest oil services company.

Credit Suisse names eight stocks to buy in battered energy sector
Eight Credit Suisse analysts each recently picked their top energy stocks to buy in eight different subsectors.Alternative energy: SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY) is a “key beneficiary” in the trends toward residential solar and lower capital costs.Independent refining: Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) deal for Hess' retail business is well timed.Integrated oil and gas; Marathon Oil's (NYSE:MRO) upstream cash margins “have room to rise as shale production rises and the oil price recovers.MLP: Genesis Energy (NYSE:GEL) is defensive in its direct exposure to commodity price weakness and offensive in distribution growth expected following its recent acquisition of offshore assets from Enterprise Products.E&P: Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) has a strong hedge position and strong oil growth relative to peers.Oil services and equipment: Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) ability to optimize margins and cash flow even in a down market makes the stock attractive.Oilfield services and marine transport: Euronav (NYSE:EURN) has flexibility for fleet acquisitions and is free to return 80% of net income to shareholders via dividends.Small- to mid-cap E&P: PDC Energy's (NASDAQ:PDCE) three-year projection of up to 40% production growth from Wattenberg even if oil prices remain as low as $50/bbl is impressive.Earlier: Credit Suisse lifts view of MLPs, sees 40% upside on revision to mean yield Aug. 11, 2015, 11:49 AM | 6 Comments
Creditors aim to push Miller Energy unit into bankruptcy
A group of companies that say they are owed millions from Miller Energy’s (NYSE:MILL) Alaska subsidiary is trying to push the unit into bankruptcy after the SEC last week charged the company with accounting fraud.Creditors of MILL’s Cook Inlet Energy subsidiary including Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) filed an involuntary chapter 11 petition last Thursday against MILL in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Anchorage, claiming the Alaska subsidiary owes them ~$2.8M.MILL plans to fight the request and restructure its debt without bankruptcy, CEO Carl Giesler tells WSJ, and is attempting to convince BHI and SLB to pull the petition.

Halliburton, Baker Hughes cut workforces deeper, bringing layoffs to 27K
Halliburton (HAL -1.5%) disclosed after last Friday's close it has cut nearly 14K jobs and Baker Hughes (BHI -1%) has laid off 13K employees since they began trimming their headcounts last year, several thousand more jobs than the companies had anticipated in April.HAL's latest layoff estimate exceeds its April figure by 5K jobs, bringing its cuts up to 16% of its workforce from its peak of more than 80K last year, while BHI's estimate is up by 2.5K jobs, up to 21% of its headcount of 62K at the end of last year.The world’s top four oilfield service companies - HAL, BHI, Schlumberger (SLB -0.7%) and Weatherford (WFT -1.3%) - have either cut or plan to cut 58K jobs this year in response to the collapse of crude prices.

Schlumberger upgraded to Buy from Hold at Societe Generale
Schlumberger (SLB +1.2%) is upgraded to Buy from Hold at Societe Generale, the latest of several upgrades for SLB after issuing its Q2 earnings late last week.SLB is displaying an exceptional ability to weather the severe downturn in the energy industry, the firm says, holding the line on its international margins despite the tough operating environment with reasonably constrained margin contraction in its North American business, particularly when compared to the severe 2009 contraction.The firm foresees further margin support from the acceleration of SLB’s initiatives targeting improvement in workforce productivity, asset utilization and a reduction in unit support costs, with more tangible benefits in the coming quarters as the ongoing acceleration takes even greater hold on organizational efficiency.

More upgrades for Schlumberger following better than expected Q2 margins
Schlumberger (SLB +0.1%) is upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo after its Q2 earnings report showed significantly better than expected margins that appear to be "sustainable through the downturn."SLB's surprising margin performance was achieved through "a combination of proactive (and aggressive) cost cutting, excellent execution, and the acceleration of its transformation initiatives," the firm says.Although pricing concessions have negatively impacted revenue and margins, Wells says growth opportunities throughout the Middle East exceed initial expectations as the Gulf countries continue to invest in order to grow production and market share, a trend that should favor SLB and help to partially offset further deepwater weakness.Global Hunter also raises its rating on SLB to Buy from Neutral, noting that the benefits of cost controls and an ongoing corporate transformation are driving "a substantial and sustainable boost in margins relative to the last down cycle."Earlier: Halliburton +3% after Q2 earnings, revenue beat expectations Jul. 20, 2015, 11:46 AM | 2 Comments
Offshore drillers under heavy pressure
Offshore drillers are significantly underperforming the broader market following cautious commentary from Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) despite its Q2 earnings beat, a contract termination and an analyst downgrade.On its earnings call this morning, SLB said it expects little improvement in pricing levels in the near future and declines in activity for offshore drillers, while land rigs provide a more attractive opportunity and better margins.For its Q3, SLB foresees a further 5%-6% decline in Q/Q revenue as well as lower EPS, and says the $0.77 consensus is a realistic number.Yesterday, ConocoPhillips (COP -1.8%) said it plans to cut future deepwater exploration spending, particularly in its operated Gulf of Mexico program; in light of the decision, COP is terminating a contract for an Ensco (ESV -4.9%) deepwater drill ship.Also, UBS today downgraded National Oilwell Varco (NOV -1.5%) to Sell from Neutral.SDRL -6.4%, RIG -4.7%, RDC -6%, DO -3.3%, ATW -4.2%, HP -1.2%, PTEN -1.2%, PACD -5.7%.

Schlumberger rises on Q2 earnings beat, rig count optimism
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) +1.3% AH after reporting better than expected Q2 earnings and offering a somewhat optimistic industry outlook.Q2 revenues fell 25% Y/Y, with North America revenue down 27% Q/Q and 39% Y/Y because of the dramatic decline in North American land activity; last year's Q2 was the final quarter before the start of the big drop in crude prices that has forced the energy industry to retrench.SLB says it expects 2015 E&P investment in North America to fall by more than 35%, compared with a previous outlook for a decline of more than 30%, but it believes the North American rig count has touched bottom and sees a possible slow increase in land drilling and completion activity in H2.Reiterates 2015 capital spending outlook of $2.5B.

Oil prices are headed higher, two top investors say
The two newsletter writers with the best track record of predicting oil market moves say the bottom is near, and crude prices should rise significantly in the next few years, Mark Hulbert reports in Barron's.Jim Stack of InvesTech Research thinks global oversupply will lessen in coming months, as U.S. drilling rig counts are down by more than half since late last year; technically, he is impressed with oil’s successful retest in March of its January low, and says the outlook will improve even more if oil remains above its March lows through August.Kelley Wright of Investment Quality Trends believes that, so long as the focus is on blue-chip companies with strong financials, the dividend yield is a reliable guide to over- and under-valuation; among blue-chip energy stocks he says are undervalued since their yields now trade near the high end of their historical ranges are XOM, CVX and SLB.ETFs: USO, OIL, UCO, UWTI, SCO, BNO, DBO, DWTI, DTO, USL, DNO, OLO, SZO, OLEM Jul. 11, 2015, 9:10 AM | 249 Comments
Morgan Stanley calls a bottom in oil services
The tide is finally starting to turn for global oil services stocks (NYSEARCA:OIH), Morgan Stanley says, now seeing a very favorable risk/reward balance for investors and up to 60% upside in the space over the next 6-9 months with only ~10% downside risk.The firm says it begins to see signs that global oil production is getting under control, as U.S. rig counts appear to have stabilized well below the level necessary to sustain production and Brazil production was recently revised well below consensus expectations.Stanley's top pick in the group is Schlumberger (SLB +1.1%), and it also likes Core Labs (CLB +2.2%), Frank's International (FI +1.5%), Patterson-UTI (PTEN +2.7%), Nabors Industries (NBR +4%) and Helmerich & Payne (HP +1.9%).

Schlumberger, Cameron upgraded at Howard Weil
Schlumberger (SLB +0.6%) is upgraded to Focus Stock from Sector Outperform, with a $100 price target, at Howard Weil, which says the combination of SLB's global scale, technology and transformational initiatives that were ongoing prior to the downturn provides a level of forward clarity that is unique among oil service companies.While SLB is typically viewed as a defensive stock in times of turmoil in the oilfield services sector, shares have underperformed its large-cap diversified peers YTD, which the firm says presents a tremendous opportunity since SLB management has a differentiated story that will become more evident as the upcoming conference call season unfolds.Howard Weil also upgrades Cameron (CAM +2.5%) to Sector Outperform from Sector Perform with a $61 price target; given CAM's robust backlog carried into the start of the year, the firm believes CAM has a fair amount of earnings visibility this year and finds management's conviction level of its shorter-cycle revenue businesses higher despite a dismal U.S. onshore rig count.

Schlumberger still Credit Suisse's "best in class" even as estimates are cut
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is still the best in class among oil and gas services providers, Credit Suisse says as it maintains its Outperform rating and $86 price target on the shares, "best able to not only weather the cyclical storm but also to change how the industry works and benefit from those changes."Still, the current climate also forces Credit Suisse to lower SLB’s earnings expectations for Q2 as well as all of 2015 and 2016; the firm's Q2 EPS estimate moves to $0.78 from $0.87, while respective 2015 and 2016 estimates are lowered to $3.50 and $3.51 from $3.90 and $3.88.The firm believes the Gulf of Mexico offers a much better market than onshore U.S., yet it expects some margin decline in the GoM, driven by a higher workover and completions mix in a "flat activity" market, all of which is likely to adversely impact North American margins.

Offshore drilling woes will continue to hurt oil services giants, analyst says
Margins and revenues of the biggest oil services companies such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) and Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) likely will remain at risk globally through 2016 due to the severity of the downturn in offshore and deepwater drilling, Wells Fargo says.Helping to partially offset the expected weakness offshore is a more resilient international land market relative to previous downturns, led by continued growth in select Middle East countries and Russia and relatively firm activity in Argentina, the firm says.The firm calls HAL its top pick among major oil services (NYSEARCA:OIH), but it lowers FY 2015 earnings estimates to negative territory for WFT and BHI.Earlier: Halliburton, Schlumberger stand out in battered oil services, J.P.

Schlumberger's Eurasia deal said to need more time
An official decision for Schlumberger’s $1.7B (SLB -1.3%) deal to acquire a stake in Russian rig contractor Eurasia Drilling may not come until later this summer, according to a report citing the head of Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service as saying further review of the deal's terms is needed.It had been expected that a special Russian government commission could make its decision on SLB's bid for a 45.65% stake in Eurasia this month.The deal, originally expected to be approved by the end of March, has been delayed three times amid concerns that Eurasia’s activities could be affected if Western sanctions against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine are extended.

Russia fails to rule on Schlumberger's proposed bid for Eurasia Drilling
Russia’s foreign investment commission met today but failed to make a decision on Schlumberger’s (SLB -0.7%) bid to purchase Eurasia Drilling, the country's natural resources minister tells Bloomberg, without giving a reason.Investors had hoped a ruling would clear the way for the deal’s $1.7B first phase, which already has been delayed months."The government probably decided to be more cautious amid rising tensions in Ukraine and statements from U.S. and EU politicians on extending sanctions against Russia," says one Moscow-based energy analyst.

Schlumberger report backs upbeat view of England oil potential
An assessment by Schlumberger (SLB +0.4%) backs claims of significant oil at the Horse Hill area in southern England, estimating a well in the Weald basin near Gatwick airport has ~271M barrels of oil per square mile after a previous report estimated ~158M.The estimate exceeds previous estimate of ~158M barrels per square mile issued by UK Oil & Gas Investments, when analysts questioned whether much oil could be extracted on a commercial basis.UKOG says it is planning to drill more exploration wells in the Weald and is assessing the potential of the reserves in the area.

EPA fracking findings undercut environmentalists’ calls for regulation
Analysts say yesterday's release of a landmark EPA study that found fracking had no widespread impact on drinking water makes it less likely that the Obama administration or Congress will strip a 2005 exemption of fracking from drinking water laws and that the EPA will move to tighten rules on disclosure of the chemicals used and limits on the methane emitted."The EPA fracking study does not appear likely to spur additional federal water regulation beyond initiatives that are already in process," ClearView Energy Partners analyst Kevin Book writes.That’s seen as good news for companies such as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the largest oil services companies, as well as producers such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), as they weather lower oil and natural gas prices.The study "is absolutely consistent with all the previous studies that show that effective well containment practices make hydraulic fracturing a very safe practice,” XOM said after the report's release.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, ERY, FCG, DIG, GASL, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, FENY, PXE, FIF, PXJ, NDP, RYE, FXN, DDG Jun. 5, 2015, 11:49 AM | 124 Comments
Halliburton, Schlumberger stand out in battered oil services, J.P. Morgan says
Oil services providers (NYSEARCA:OIH) and drillers are eyed with caution by the J.P. Morgan analyst team, which warns that most of the stocks have put much of their near-term upside behind them.But JPM sees a bright spot in the large-cap service sector, where "scale matters even more [than usual] in what we expect to be a shallower recovery."JPM rates Halliburton (HAL +0.6%) and Schlumberger (SLB +0.4%) at Overweight with respective price targets of $56 and $101; the firm praises HAL's pending merger with Baker Hughes, which it thinks will create “create a powerhouse North American competitor," and says SLB is positioned to come out of the downturn strong, thanks to its presence in attractive markets and initiatives it began before oil prices fell.The firm also rates Weatherford (WFT +0.4%) at Overweight, with a $19 target, believing WFT will enjoy "substantially improved operating leverage in the next upcycle" after shedding non-core assets and lowering its leverage.

OneSubsea wins $330M contract for North Africa offshore gas project
OneSubsea, a joint venture between Cameron (NYSE:CAM) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), is awarded a $330M contract to install and service subsea production systems for a natural gas project off the coast of North Africa, at a time when orders for underwater oil field equipment have faded.The scope of supply for the 13-well development includes subsea production equipment, tooling, and installation and commissioning services; deliveries are expected to begin in Q3 2016.The award is the second part of the project and is the largest contract for work on subsea production systems in North Africa, according to CAM CEO Jack Moore; OneSubsea already was the supplier for the first phase of the offshore project.

Land drillers Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN -6.1%), Nabors Industries (NBR -6.1%) and Weatherford (WFT -2.7%) are downgraded to Underperform from Outperform at CLSA, based on its belief that oil prices remain vulnerable.CLSA describes the advancement of unconventional drilling and completion as one of the most disruptive technologies in oilfield history, an achievement that likely will derail the normalization of a cycle and trigger a number of structural consequences; the firm says it favors maintstays such as Halliburton (HAL -1.1%) and Schlumberger (SLB -1.4%) "that have and will continue to facilitate the change, not those that will be impaired by the change."

Schlumberger maintained Buy, with higher price target, at UBS
Schlumberger (SLB +0.3%) is maintained with a Buy rating but a higher stock price target of $110, up from $95, at UBS, which notes that while expecting industry conditions to remain challenging this year and next, the company has impressively cut costs and stayed ahead of the curve leading to lower decremental margins than widely expected.However, UBS still believes the industry capacity will remain over-supplied in 2015-16, thus dampening pricing; additionally, SLB and the firm expect only a moderate recovery in North America drilling; however, strong cost management and lower decrementals leads the firm to increase its EPS forecast for SLB by 15%-24% in 2015-17.

U.S. oil drilling faces slow recovery, Schlumberger CEO predicts
An eventual recovery in U.S. oil drilling activity "will fall well short of reaching previous levels," because of a growing reserve of wells that have been drilled but not yet hydraulically fractured and increased activity in re-fracking wells that are running dry, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in Friday's earnings conference call.At least 2,700 wells have been identified as candidates for re-fracture in North America, representing a total market value of ~$5B, says EvercoreISI's James West, adding that the Eagle Ford likely contains 1,000 of the wells while the Bakken has ~500.The assessment suggests the disconnect between oil rigs and the trajectory of U.S. production may get worse before it gets better; while output had been rising in tandem with the number of rigs, production has continued climbing even as the rig count has collapsed to less than half its October 2014 peak.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, ERY, DIG, DUG, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, FENY, PXE, PXJ, RYE, FXN, DDG Apr. 18, 2015, 8:25 AM | 8 Comments

A prolonged period of low oil prices will be difficult for energy stocks, and Schlumberger (SLB +0.2%) is no different, but analysts say the company is showing it is adjusting to the new normal and still finding ways to squeeze efficiencies from its businesses, with the latest job cutbacks providing the most recent example.Analysts say SLB's costs fell in line with revenue due to rapid reductions in variable costs, improved execution and the acceleration of the company’s internal efficiency initiatives.Despite lower pricing and activity in the industry that has pushed sales down, SLB’s execution and aggressive cost-cutting initiatives "resulted in outstanding margin performance vs. our expectation,” Wells Fargo says; SLB's international margins of 24% were "surprisingly resilient," Morgan Stanley says, marking a Y/Y jump of ~130 bps, which "translates into 25% decrementals, vs. our expectation of 40%, suggesting that SLB's cost reduction efforts are bearing fruit."In its earnings conference call, SLB says it expects to maintain the cash quality of its earnings by continuing to convert 75% or more of net income into free cash flow.

Schlumberger to cut 11K more jobs, warns of weak U.S. land drilling recovery
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) +2.5% AH after Q1 earnings fell sharply Y/Y but beat Wall Street estimates, and the company said it would cut another 2K jobs.SLB now plans to cut another 11K jobs, leading to a total workforce reduction of ~15% compared to the peak from last year's Q3, after laying off 9K employees late last year; SLB recorded a related $390M pretax charge in Q1.SLB had warned that its North American operations would be hardest hit by the plunge in oil prices, and its Q1 North America revenue fell 13% to $3.2B; most of SLB’s operations are international, where Q1 revenue fell 8% to $6.9B.CEO Paal Kibsgaard says the company believes "a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time, as the inventory of uncompleted wells builds and as the re-fracturing market expands, [but] a recovery in activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels, hence extending the period of pricing weakness."SLB also says it is cutting its 2015 capex guidance to $2.5B from an earlier estimate of $3B and down from $4B spent last year.S&P analyst Stewart Glickman says it is hard to see where the company and its rivals can cut without slicing into muscle.SLB's two largest competitors, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) - which agreed to merge last year - are scheduled to report earnings next week.

WTI crude jumps to highest settlement of the year
May crude oil futures rose 6% today to $56.25/bbl, the highest settlement of the year, enjoying a boost from a higher global oil demand forecast from the International Energy Agency and another rise in U.S. crude supplies.The weekly inventory report showed a lower-than-expected 1.294M-barrel build in inventories, enough to send U.S. crude oil inventories to 483.7M barrels for their highest level at this time of year in at least 80 years.The narrative that oil prices may have found a bottom is beginning to pick up, which is helping drive buying interest in energy stocks; among today's gainers are XOM +1.9%, CVX +1.6%, COP +1.6%, BP +1.4%, RDS.A +2.9%, HES +4.5%, SLB +2.9%, HAL +3.9%.ETFs: USO, OIL, XLE, UCO, UWTI, VDE, ERX, OIH, SCO, XOP, BNO, DBO, DWTI, ERY, DIG, DTO, DUG, USL, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, DNO, FENY, PXE, PXI, PXJ, OLO, SZO, RYE, FXN, TWTI, OLEM, DDG Apr. 15, 2015, 3:15 PM | 69 Comments
More on RayJay's downgrade of oil services names
"No one (including us) has a really good handle on energy industry earnings estimates over the next few years," says J. Marshall Adkins and team at Raymond James, downgrading Cameron International (CAM -1%), Nabors Industries (NBR -0.3%), Schlumberger (SLB -0.8%), FMC Technologies (FTI -1.5%), and Basic Energy Services (BAS -6.6%).Nevertheless, Adkins gives it his best shot and his numbers are well below the Street for 2015 and 2016. Then there's valuations, and the recent surge in prices has left them less than compelling.Noted is substantial pricing pressur and overcapacity in many business lines, a more prolonged downturn internationally, and offshore activity not expected to see even a moderate uptick for several years.Source: Barron's Previously: Schlumberger slips as Raymond James heads to the sidelines (April 13)Previously: Raymond James throws in the towel on oil services (April 13) Apr. 13, 2015, 11:24 AM | 2 Comments

Schlumberger-Eurasia deal gets Russia energy minister's vote of confidence
Schlumberger (SLB +2.2%) is higher after Russia's energy minister said the country would not oppose a deal with SLB for the purchase of a 45.65% stake in Eurasia Drilling on the condition that certain risks are offset.SLB agreed in January to purchase a stake in Eurasia, Russia's largest onshore drilling company, for $1.7B with the option to purchase the remaining stake at a later date; the deal was supposed to close by the end of March but last week the deadline was pushed back to the end of April.Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service has not yet provided a full list of conditions to SLB, but one possible conditions is that SLB would have to sell the Eurasia stake to Russian investors if further sanctions against the country block its operations.

Moody's sees tough year for oilfield services firms, even if prices rebound
Even if oil prices rebound, oilfield services firms have a tough year ahead as producers squeeze them for deeper discounts, Moody’s says in a new analysis, predicting that the industry is headed for a “deep, protracted cyclical downturn."Because many oil companies are drilling but not completing wells, oil services firms that provide production-related services will fare better than those offering pressure pumping, seismic services and other exploration-type activities.No company is immune, but the big three - Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) - are best positioned because they are large, diverse, well-funded and have operations outside of North America, Moody's says, while Paragon Offshore (NYSE:PGN) and Hercules Offshore (NASDAQ:HERO) will see the sharpest decline in earnings as contracts expire for their fleet of older-generation jackup rigs.Moody’s expects to see more offshore firms stack rigs, delay rig deliveries and write down assets as contracts get changed or canceled;lLand drillers will not fare much better, particularly those operating in expensive U.S. shale plays.ETFs: OIH, XES, IEZ Apr. 1, 2015, 3:38 PM | 11 Comments

Oppenheimer cuts targets for big oil services stocks but still sees big upside
Oppenheimer cuts its EPS estimates and stock price targets on Schlumberger (SLB -1%), Halliburton (HAL -2.4%) and Baker Hughes (BHI -1.8%), as the companies are in the midst of one of the sharpest activity reductions in this sector in the past 30 years, but its maintains Outperform ratings that still come with big upside if the respective price targets are met.The firm believes the rapid pace of activity decline benefits investors because it could bring world oil markets into balance more quickly, and sees a better than average chance for upside surprise in 2016 due to recovering oil prices and healthy incremental margins from 2015 cost-reduction measures.Oppenheimer cut SLB's 2015 EPS estimate to $3.35 from $4.25, its 2016 estimate to $4.40 from $5.50, and its price target to $101 from $110; HAL's 2015 EPS is lowered to $1.70 from $2.70, its 2016 EPS to $2.85 from $4.00, and its price target to $60 from $64; BHI's 2015 EPS is reduced to $1.75 from $2.50, its 2016 EPS to $2.60 from $3.40, and its price target to $58 from $60.

Schlumberger is top large-cap oilfield services pick at Credit Suisse

For now, SLB wins." Mar. 6, 2015, 11:45 AM | 3 Comments

WSJ: Saudi Aramco seeks to cut costs, asks oil services providers for deals
Saudi Aramco, whose prolific production has contributed to the drop in oil prices, is starting to feel the pain from its country’s decision to keep pumping and is now asking contractors for steep discounts in an effort to cut costs, according to a WSJ report.The Saudi oil company reportedly summoned oil services companies including Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) to ask for discounts of up to 20% on certain services such as well testing procedures; the companies do a combined $6B/year in business with Aramco.The Saudi company also is said to have delayed plans to build a $2B clean fuels plant and held up deepwater oil and gas exploration and drilling activities in the Red Sea because their profitability is now in question.Aramco is considering slashing E&P spending to $30B/year from $40B while oil prices remain low, industry sources say.

Time to buy U.S. land drillers to position for oil recovery, analyst says
RBC analysts think it's time to position for an oil recovery by buying oilfield services stocks such as Schlumberger (SLB -1.2%), Patterson-UTI (PTEN -0.4%), Nabors Industries (NBR +2.5%) and Precision Drilling (PDS +0.4%).The firm believes oil prices will bottom in H1 2015, improves during H2 and averages at least $75/bbl in 2016, and sees U.S. land drillers and intensive service companies providing the best returns in the early phases of cycle recovery.RBC notes that three of the top five performing stocks in the sector off the lows since 1997 have been PTEN, PDS and NBR; the firm considers SLB and NBR as best ideas, while PTEN is a small-cap best idea.

Sanctions have not stopped SLB, BHI from bidding for work in Russian Arctic
U.S. and European suppliers to the oil industry are still able to seek work in Russia’s Arctic despite sanctions designed to limit their involvement because the rules do not apply to international subsidiaries, according to a Bloomberg report.Schlumberger’s (SLB -0.6%) Russian unit bid in a December tender to supply drilling fluids to an offshore Arctic project operated by Gazprom Neft, and in the prior month, Baker Hughes’ (BHI -0.4%) local unit and a Panamanian unit of Schlumberger offered drilling services at the same field.Neither company has been accused of breaking any laws, and none of the bids was successful, but the use of subsidiaries to legally skirt sanctions will raise questions about the effectiveness of measures imposed to punish Russia.

Schlumberger's $1.7B for stake in Russian driller gets cool reception
The timing for Schlumberger’s (SLB -0.7%) acquisition of 45.6% in Russia’s largest drilling company is considered unusual, given the sanctions imposed on Russia, but Eurasia's shares have fallen by more than 60% over the past year after top customers Lukoil and Gazprom came under sanctions.The move signals that SLB is “taking an opportunity to strengthen its presence in the regional market,” the Otrkitie brokerage says, adding that it views the $22/share valuation of the deal as fair.SLB stock price targets are cut at several firms, including Argus and Jefferies, to reflect expectations for reduced spending by E&P customers, although the company generally is seen as well positioned in 2015 despite current industry headwinds.

Schlumberger sees new tech adopted more quickly amid falling oil prices
Schlumberger (SLB +5.8%) pushes to highs of the day following Q4 results that were strong operationally once the big writedowns are stripped away, with continued strength driven by record activity in North America, Middle East and Asia.In today's earnings conference call, CEO Paal Kibsgaard says crude oil’s collapse is putting heat on SLB’s prices for drilling services and fracking in North America, but the upside is that shale producers now want better technologies to squeeze more oil out of the wells they have already drilled.Next-generation fracturing fluids SLB introduced early last year have so far grown in sales at 4x the rate of its 2011 iteration - which was a fast grower on its own - as falling oil prices force oil companies to adopt new technologies faster and more broadly.On the pending merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), the CEO says the deal could mean a glass ceiling on SLB’s market share in some countries will fall away.

Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) tops Credit Suisse's list of its nine favorite energy and utility stocks to own for 2015, believing KMI’s recent MLP acquisitions will lower the company’s cost of capital and open the door for double-digit dividend growth and additional potential acquisitions.Noble Corp. (NYSE:NE) is the top pick among offshore drillers, despite the fact that analysts don’t believe the inflection point in the drilling down-cycle is coming until at least 2016; fulfilling the firm's $30 price target would mean nearly 90% upside.Also recommended: SUNE, EXC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TSO, DVN, PDCE, SLB.SandRidge Energy (NYSE:SD) is one of Credit Suisse's five energy and utility stocks to avoid despite an upbeat quarterly report, believing the risk associated with SD’s extremely high leverage likely will lead to significant capex cuts, thus limiting production growth and cash flows.The firm also would avoid CVRR, SFY, YGE and SO.

Oil and gas companies could cut E&P spending in North America by 30% or more this year if U.S. crude oil prices continue to trade at $50-$60/bbl, Barclays estimates on the basis of a survey of 225 oil and gas companies.The firm expects U.S. onshore rig count to fall by 500 rigs over the year to ~1,250 rigs by the end of 2015.Barclays says this is only the seventh time in the 30-year history of its survey that global spending is estimated to fall, adding that spending rose by more than 10% the following year after almost every decline.In the oilfield services group (NYSEARCA:OIH), the firm initiates Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and FMC Tech (NYSE:FTI) at Overweight, and Forum Energy Tech (NYSE:FET) and Dril-Quip (NYSE:DRQ) at Underweight; Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Cameron (NYSE:CAM), Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) and Superior Energy (NYSE:SPN) are started at Equal Weight.ETFs: XLE, ERX, VDE, XOP, ERY, DIG, DUG, IYE, XES, IEO, IEZ, PXE, FENY, PXJ, RYE, FXN, DDG Jan. 9, 2015, 7:55 AM | 12 Comments

Credit Suisse's James Wicklund suggests avoiding oilfield services stocks, as the firm cuts its earnings estimates on Schlumberger (SLB -0.7%), Weatherford (WFT -0.7%) and Cameron International (CAM +0.9%) by 20% or more.The analyst expects the rig count to decline every week for the next three months and fall by another 400-plus rigs; it also believes downside earnings revisions have just started, and the conference calls will be ugly, meaning sector sentiment is bound to get worse."While prices typically bottom in Q1, the duration and magnitude of the slowdown required to balance the markets will require at least a full year, so prices could skip along that bottom for an extended period," Wicklund writes.

Oppenheimer defends large cap oil service stocks

The super majors are probably the first place to look when oil prices fall, writes Avi Salzman, as their stocks tend to slide less drastically than smaller players, and maintenance of dividends is a priority for management. Favorites: Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX).While smaller producers appear risky, Occidental (NYSE:OXY) came into the price plunge well-positioned with one of the industry's cleanest balance sheets.EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) could be the pick among shale drillers, says Salzman, as it's chosen drilling spots carefully and its break-even price is among the lowest in the industry. "[The] best management team in Houston," says one fund manager.Oil service stocks look especially vulnerable with capex budgets being cut, but Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) "should have protection in the downturn," writes Salzman, noting the company repurchased 1% of the float in Q3 and at 1.8% yields more than (soon to-be-merged) Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).See also: Barron's: Five oils to be wary of (Dec. 20, 2014) Dec. 20, 2014, 1:29 PM | 34 Comments

FBR offers five favorite energy stocks for 2015
FBR Capital chooses Noble Energy (NBL +8.8%), Schlumberger (SLB +4.6%), Synergy Resources (SYRG +6%), Consol Energy (CNX +3.4%) and SunEdison (SUNE +0.7%) as its top energy and natural resources stocks for 2015.FBR likes NBL's strong combination of shale assets that are still immature in their adoption and application of technology, which is scalable; a strong balance sheet; and a portfolio that offers abundant exploration risk/reward potential.SLB is FBR's favorite energy stock among those whose secular earnings power is clearly the most likely to significantly expand over the next five years and/or is underestimated at current market multiples.SYRG offers investors exposure to industry-leading production growth and a solid balance sheet, a unique combination for a small-cap equity, the firm says.

Another day of pain for energy stocks
Energy stocks are slammed across the board as oil prices take another nosedive (I, II), with the losses heaviest on shares of small, U.S.-based oil and gas producers.“Financial leverage is being thrown out the window, and everything else is being purged as well,” says Simmons analyst Bill Herbert, who adds that cuts to production budgets in the coming year likely will mean more pain for oil service companies.Among the hardest-hit shares: TPLM -15.2%, CRK -12.4%, GDP -11.9%, NOG -9.5%, AREX -8.6%.Investors have been less quick to dump shares of integrated oil companies, but today they have been smacked too: XOM -2.8%, CVX -2.9%, COP -2.3%, BP -2%, RDS.A -2.2%, TOT -2.3%.Today's worst performers on the S&P 500 include OKE -8.2%, DNR -7.4%, NE -5.6%.Service companies also are down: SLB -2.6%, HAL -2.7%, WFT -6.6%, BHI -2%.ETFs: XLE, ERX, VDE, OIH, ERY, DIG, DUG, IYE, XES, IEZ, PXI, FENY, PXJ, RYE, FXN, DDG Dec. 10, 2014, 12:58 PM | 85 Comments
Fracking discounts seen cutting profits at oil service companies by $3B-plus
Oilfield contractors hired to drill wells and fracture rock will have to lower prices by as much as 20%, analysts say, which could cut more than $3B from the 2015 earnings that had been expected for the likes of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) and Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT).Oil producers will be pushing for discounts wherever they can find them, and may begin to take shape as early as this month, with fracking services perhaps seeing the biggest chunk of pricing discounts because it is the largest part of the cost of drilling a new well.Earnings estimates for oil service companies that have been cut since last week will continue to be revised lower, says Credit Suisse's James Wicklund: “We’ve just gotten started.” Dec. 9, 2014, 6:42 PM | 8 Comments
Jefferies cuts Brent forecast, downgrades oil services stocks
Jefferies downgrades oil service stocks Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Oceaneering (NYSE:OII) and Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) as it lowers its Brent oil price forecast for 2015 to $72/bbl from $90, as well as an average 16% for 2015, 2016 and 2017.The firm expects oil prices to remain under pressure from temporary oversupply and sluggish global economic growth through H1 of next year, and remains concerned about longer-term deepwater development in light of oil prices vs. cost structures.Jefferies views Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) as the most defensive oil stocks in an environment where overall integrated oil earnings will drop 30% in 2015 and 21% in 2016.

Oil slide cuts $46M in future pay for Nabors CEO Petrello
The rout in oil prices has knocked $46M off the potential compensation for Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) CEO Anthony Petrello, the highest-paid oil executive in the U.S., whose future pay passed $100M in July but has fallen to $58M as shares in the company plunged 57% during the last five months.“The land rig sector, of which Nabors is the biggest, is facing some severe headwinds on the earnings and cash flow they will make," says Credit Suisse analyst James Wicklund.Petrello’s losses are almost twice as much as those of the next four highest-paid U.S. oil CEOs combined; Exxon’s (NYSE:XOM) Rex Tillerson, Conoco's (NYSE:COP) Ryan Lance, Schlumberger’s (NYSE:SLB) Paal Kibsgaard and Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) John Watson lost an average 19%, or ~$24M, of the value of their compensation since July 3, according to Bloomberg data.

Oppenheimer starts coverage on oilfield services
Oppenheimer initiates coverage on Schlumberger (SLB +1.6%), Halliburton (HAL +1.4%) and Weatherford (WFT +1%) with Outperform ratings and rates oilfield services rival Baker Hughes (BHI +1.6%) at Perform.The firm views the drop in oil prices as an opportunity, believing investors should take advantage of recent stock price weakness and build or add to positions in SLB, HAL and WFT; on SLB, Oppenheimer says the stock tends to outperform peers in down markets, and SLB is clearly well positioned to benefit from an increase in E&P spending should oil prices rebound.The market is taking a myopic view on HAL's combination with BHI, the firm says, as the proposed merger will create a more valuable entity that can more effectively compete with SLB internationally.

Schlumberger to take $800M writedown as it reduces seismic fleet
Schlumberger (SLB +0.3%) says it expects to take an $800M charge in Q4 to write down the value of six vessels and other assets related to its plan to reduce the size of its WesternGeco marine seismic fleet.SLB expects to retire some older vessels, convert some others and cancel most of its third-party charters as it anticipates reduced spending by oil and gas companies in exploring for new sources of energy.The moves would reduce the size of SLB's WesternGeco fleet to nine survey vessels and six source vessels, compared with 15 survey vessels and eight source boats at the end of last year.

Energy stocks routed again, despite crude’s bounce
Oil prices are rebounding, with both WTI and Brent crude up ~2%, but only a handful of energy stocks are rising.Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.4%) and Chevron (CVX +1.3%) are both up more than 1%, but the vast majority of energy stocks - led by Denbury Resources (DNR -8.9%), Newfield Exploration (NFX -7.6%) and Goodrich Petroleum (GDP -22.3%) - are seeing heavy selling.The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF (XLE -1.2%) is lower despite gains in XOM and CVX, XLE’s two most heavily weighted stocks, as 38 of its 43 equity components trade lower; the ETF has now lost 7.5% since OPEC sent oil prices plunging by agreeing last Thursday not to cut production.Among XLE’s most actively traded components, Kinder Morgan (KMI -3.3%), Halliburton (HAL -3.4%), Transocean (RIG -6.1%) and Schlumberger (SLB -2.1%) are sharply lower.Other big decliners include BBEP -17.8%, SD -12.1%, SN -13%, CWEI -8.8%, CPE -14.6%, EXXI -18.9%, LRE -22.8%, REI -16.9%, SSE -15.3%.Other ETFs: ERX, VDE, OIH, XOP, ERY, DIG, DUG, IYE, XES, IEO, IEZ, PXE, FENY, PXJ, RYE, FXN, DDG Dec. 1, 2014, 12:21 PM | 43 Comments

Weatherford must first weather oil services storm
Weatherford (WFT +0.2%) is the most vulnerable among the big four oil services companies to falling crude oil prices based on price-to-book valuations, which help offer a sense of where the floor in valuations might be in a down cycle.The minimum price-to-book ratio WFT reached during 2010-13 was 0.87x, while today it trades at 1.62x - the potential drop of 46% is the widest of the big four.The smallest of the group, WFT's market share in technology-intensive services of less than 10% is about one-third that of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) or a merged Halliburton-Baker Hughes (HAL, BHI), according to Morgan Stanley’s Ole Slorer.Another factor against WFT is its net debt; using management guidance and current consensus profit forecasts, WFT should end the year still more than 2x EBITDA, while the other four are below 1x EBITDA.

Investors sour on Halliburton deal after big premium paid for Baker Hughes
The 56% premium Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is paying for Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) is the largest of any merger in the past two decades worth more than $20B that targeted a U.S. company, so it’s little wonder that HAL shareholders sent the stock plunging 10% today even as most analysts reacted favorably to the deal.For HAL investors, the deal’s benefits will have to come from the stock being rewarded with a higher multiple down the line, as the bigger company shows it can compete more effectively; with antitrust scrutiny and falling oil prices to navigate first, that's going to take a while.BHI’ shares closed near $65, ~17% below HAL’s offer, with tells S&P Capital that the market views antitrust hurdles as significant; if the deal goes through, the merged firm and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) combined could have 70%-90% of the market in some service areas, according to the American Antitrust Institute.Even if the two companies can close the deal and find the promised $2B/year in cost synergies, analysts are still concerned about volatile commodity prices; also, "market share losses and execution challenges have plagued [HAL] in the past and could be an overhang going forward," a Susquehanna analyst says.

Halliburton faces $3.5B breakup fee if Baker Hughes deal fails
Halliburton (HAL -9.8%) must pay a $3.5B breakup fee if its deal for Baker Hughes (BHI +10.3%) falls through, ~10% of the $34.6B deal value, far higher than the usual ~4% paid by U.S. acquirers this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The fee could be viewed as a barometer of the regulatory risk HAL faces, but it is also a sign that HAL is confident it will successfully navigate that risk.Once combined, HAL and BHI would dominate the $25B U.S. market for onshore fracking, and unseat rival Schlumberger (SLB +0.6%) in several key lines of business.Investors may be misreading the situation, says FBN Securities' head of merger arbitrage Kathy Renck, who believes a 10% breakup fee is not out of line in a situation with known antitrust issues.

Halliburton, Baker Hughes still higher after confirming merger talks
Oil services companies are mostly higher as Halliburton (HAL +1.7%) is indeed in talks to buy Baker Hughes (BHI +0.5%), a deal that would provide a jolt to oilfield services companies contending with falling oil prices: SLB +0.4%, OIS +1.2%, SPN +2.3%, CAM +0.2%, FTI -0.3%, NOV -0.6%.Sterne Agee analyst Stephen Gengaro calls a potential HAL-BHI combo a “HAL of a Frac-ing Deal," seeing several positives for HAL including strengthening its relatively weak position in artificial lift and production chemicals which are critical to enhancing HAL’s mature field strategy, enabling it to leverage its unparalleled U.S. pressure pumping logistics chain to enhance the efficiency of BHI’s operations, and providing the opportunity for significant cost savings which likely would total $600M-$750M or more.While antitrust concerns could force some divestitures, Gengaro does not believe it would prevent a deal from happening.Other potentially attractive M&A targets among oil services companies could include Dril-Quip (DRQ +0.7%), Frank’s International (FI +2.6%) and Oceaneering (OII -0.2%), Simmons & Co. says.

Halliburton-Baker Hughes combo risks customer backlash
Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) confirms it has engaged in preliminary talks with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) about a potential business combination and will offer no further comment.A merger could provide HAL with a "significant advantage in gaining global share, expanding margins and competing" against Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), UBS analysts say, but digesting such a large acquisition could take two years or more and be a distraction to HAL.A combination of the second and third largest listed oil services groups by market cap likely would draw scrutiny from U.S. regulators, but the biggest obstacle to a deal might come from its E&P customers worried about the potential for higher prices at a time of falling crude oil prices.Also, doing a deal as oil continues to slide should make it a tough sell to BHI shareholders: Why sell amid such turmoil?

Halliburton sees no drilling slowdown despite lower crude
Halliburton (HAL +0.9%) says it sees no signs of a slowdown in drilling activity despite the recent plunge in oil prices, echoing comments made last week (I, II) by rivals Schlumberger (SLB +0.5%) and Baker Hughes (BHI -0.9%)."Industry fundamentals suggest that these lower prices are not sustainable," HAL CEO Dave Lesar said on today's earnings conference call, noting that North American customers and national oil companies have not indicated a slowdown in activity levels.HAL says North America activity levels continue to surge higher month over month due to an unprecedented level of service intensity, noting it called the turnaround two quarters ago; this quarter, activity clearly is accelerating since the turnaround, it says, and does not see momentum slowing any time soon.

Barron's: Schlumberger shares rose on strong earnings but have further to go
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) finished with a solid 3.7% gain today after a strong Q3 earnings report, but investors were particularly reassured by CEO Paal Kibsgaard's declarations that oil prices will recover and stabilize."The key to the overall oil market is still that the global oil demand is currently set to increase by 1.1M bbl/day in 2015, which will require growth in exploration and production investments," the CEO said in today's earnings call.SLB shares had slumped 20%-plus in the three months before today due to the sharp slide in crude prices, and analysts say the stock still looks cheap.While WTI crude prices in the low-$80s have highlighted some concerns over the willingness of upstream customers to spend through the pricing weakness, "we believe prices are still more than sufficiently high to induce customers to keep existing plans,” writes S&P Capital's Stewart Glickman, who maintains a Buy rating and $128 price target on SLB.

OPEC tensions, lower oil prices may hit oilfield firms, analyst says
Reports that Iran will follow Saudi Arabia in cutting oil prices likely will create "stiff headwinds" for companies in the oilfield services industry (NYSEARCA:OIH), according to a new report from Sterne Agee's Stephen Gengaro, though bigger players such as Schlumberger and Halliburton should hold out better than others.Although crude oil prices pared their big drops today, the analyst expects price weakness to continue in the short-term amid tensions within the OPEC cartel that are leading to an "apparent price war."While Gengaro expects minimal impact on oilfield activity for the balance of 2014, a continued slide in crude oil prices probably would hurt in 2015, especially in North America.Sector names finished broadly lower today: SLB -1.9%, HAL -5.2%, OII -0.5%, BHI -3.2%, SPN -3.9%, TTI -4.4%, CJES -3.5%, RES -6.2%, KEG +0.9%.

Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reportedly is withdrawing employees who are citizens of the U.S. and EU from Russia amid sanctions.Russia relies on fracking for 25% of its oil production and replacing technology developed by companies like SLB would require “colossal funds,” Lukoil (OTCPK:LUKOY, OTC:LUKOF) CEO Vagit Alekperov says.SLB gets 5%-7% of its global sales from Russia.

Deutsche Bank sees buying opportunity for select oil services stocks
Deutsche Bank analysts say they came away encouraged after hosting a series of one-on-one meetings with top energy companies; despite recent negative sentiment on the group, it paints an optimistic outlook for oil service companies, which see continued strength in the overall spending outlook from customers, even with the move down in commodity prices.Among the firm's top Buy-rated stocks in the group is Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), down 12.5% since July 1; despite a slowdown from Libya, Iraq and Russia, the DB team likes the outlook for Latin America, with a recent contract win in Brazil in wireline and better pricing in its drilling contract, and eyeing start-up work in Mexico.DB also likes Hercules Offshore (NASDAQ:HERO), which has cratered 63% YTD; the company expects slow going in the Gulf of Mexico until the end of this year’s hurricane season, but opportunities look much brighter in 2015.Rounding out the firm's favorites: BHI, BAS, EXH, FET, PES.

Schlumberger seen as likely Petrobras service contract winner
Schlumberger (SLB -1.9%) is favored to win half of more than $2B in well services work being offered by Petrobras (PBR -6.7%) after submitting the most competitive bid for a package representing 50% of the work, Bloomberg reports.Halliburton (HAL -1.7%) is said to have placed the lowest-cost bid for 30% of the job, and Baker Hughes (BHI -1.6%) appears positioned to win the remaining 20%.The contract involves a cabling technology used by energy companies to lower equipment into wells for repairs and maintenance or to evaluate reservoirs; SLB is the biggest global provider of these wireline services in a ~$20B/year market.

Schlumberger's profits should gush - Barron's
Barron's cover story is positive about oil-services giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), whose recent acquisitions have catapulted SLB into a position of leadership in extracting liquids from shale basins, part of the booming business in hydraulic fracturing that's reshaping the industry.The acquisitions fix one of the company's few week spots, and should put it further ahead of smaller rivals like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).CEO Paal Kibsgaard believes SLB can achieve a 10x increase in operational reliability, reduce inventory levels by 25%, boost asset utilization by 100%, raise productivity by 20%, and lower unit support costs by 10%. By 2017, he expects to boost EPS to $9-10 (from $5.70 this year).Despite an 18% gain this year, shares looks cheap at about 9x estimated 2015 EV/Ebitda and eight times estimated 2016 EV/Ebitda vs. a historical multiple of 10 to 11.

Schlumberger will be hit more by Iraq than Russia, RBC says
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) expects the economic sanctions in Russia will have a small financial impact on its operations in the country, but RBC analysts see SLB impacted more by the instability in Iraq.The firm estimates SLB gains ~$600M from annual Iraq revenue ($0.06-$0.08 in EPS) with operating margins of ~20%, so it lowers its 2014 EPS forecast to $5.56 from $5.64 as well as its 2015 ooutlook to $6.63 from $6.70; however, the firm maintains its stock price target at $129.Other companies with large exposure to Russia also fell today, including Weatherford (NYSE:WFT), Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).

Mexico enacts energy initiative, decision this week on areas open for bidding
Mexico Pres. Pena Nieto today signed into law the rules governing the country's historic opening of the state-run oil, gas and electricity industries to foreign and private companies.The government, which is hoping for tens of billions of dollars in outside investment in deepwater oil drilling and shale gas production, says it will let potential investors know by Wednesday which blocks of gas and oil fields will be open for them.HSBC analysts like how the new laws are shaping up, particularly the creation of a sovereign oil wealth fund, "as it constitutes a long-term savings mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of public finances and economic growth to global shocks"; as for equities, the firm sees opportunities for resource-hungry China as well as for major oilfield services companies such as Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).ETFs: EWW, UMX, SMK, DBMX Aug. 11, 2014, 3:19 PM | 1 Comment

Schlumberger -1.4% as Q2 profit drops even as revenues rise
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) -1.4% AH after reporting a 24% Y/Y drop in Q2 earnings despite higher revenue driven by higher activity both offshore and in key land markets.Revenue in North America rose 15% to $3.89B, while the Middle East and Asia saw 11.7% growth to $2.97M, and Europe, Africa and the CIS rose 4% to $3.23B; Latin American revenue fell ~3% to $1.85B.SLB says strong drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in U.S. onshore drilling more than offset seasonal weakness in Canada, but the company has less exposure to North America among the top oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).SLB says the overall global economic outlook remains mixed, although "the fundamentals for a slow and steady recovery... remain intact."

HSBC latest to sing praises for Schlumberger, rally looks set to continue
Schlumberger's (SLB +0.2%) recent rally isn't likely to run out of gas anytime soon, HSBC says as it upgrades shares to Overweight from Neutral and raises its target price by $30 to $135 and sees significant medium-term gains "based on a strengthening earnings trajectory, and an improving financial returns and free cash flow profile."Although SLB is flirting with new highs, its impressive growth track appears to justify further price appreciation; at its recent analyst day, SLB said it expects EPS to grow at an average annual rate of 17%-20% and is targeting a return on capital above 20%."The combination of attractive West Texas Intermediate [oil] prices, rising capital expenditure budgets, [and] strong rig/well count trends suggest we are in the sweet-spot of the oilfield services upcycle," Susquehanna analysts say.

UBS adds Schlumberger to Equity Focus List, upgrades oilfield services
Schlumberger (SLB +0.1%) makes its debut on the UBS Equity Focus List, as UBS and other Wall Street analysts think the oilfield services company will continue to drive margins on execution, technologies and efficiencies.UBS raises its rating on the sector to Neutral from Underweight, citing the growing drive for North American energy independence by the end of the decade.UBS also likes other top E&P and oilfield services leaders: Halliburton (HAL +0.3%) should enjoy a boost from a forecast 5% increase in margins over the next three years combined with a tightening frac calendar in some regions, Apache (APA -0.5%) trades at a discount vs. peers, and Anadarko (APC -0.9%) is favored amid rising demand for natural gas.

Report: Petrobras to offer $2B in supply contracts
Petrobras (PBR) is set to offer more than $2B in drilling service contracts, some under revised terms after suppliers complained about the original agreements, according to a Bloomberg report.PBR is said to be reissuing the contracts after a reduction in the company’s rig fleet eroded suppliers’ margins, and would be offering wireline and well completion contracts too.Halliburton (HAL), which has said service companies in Brazil were seeking relief and that deepwater drilling activity was below expectations, reportedly would participate in the new contracts, as would Baker Hughes (BHI) and Schlumberger (SLB).

If progress in “converting” the U.S. to a 'smarter' development approach may feel limited, there are at least signs of E&Ps considering it and anyway the U.S. offers some upside as well."

$100/bbl oil is big for top oil service stocks, UBS says
UBS says the tone was positive at its recent energy conference in Texas, with further data points supporting a strong outlook for the North American land market, and recommends sticking with its top oil service names.UBS believes Baker Hughes' (BHI) margin gains in North America will be driven by continued margin improvement in pressure pumping, new technologies, increased activity in U.S. land and higher Gulf of Mexico activity.FMC Technologies (FTI) is a top equipment stock to buy at UBS, where analysts believe subsea equipment is one of the few service areas that will see secular growth in 2014 and beyond.Also recommended: FI, SLB, HAL, WFT.

Halliburton hits all-time highs as Q1 beats estimates, Q2 looks even better
Halliburton (HAL +3.2%) shares hit an all-time high as investors look past weather-afflicted Q1 North American profit margins to focus on the company's sunny Q2 forecast of 25% higher earnings with further increases to follow.HAL is more dependent on U.S. operations than rival Schlumberger (SLB +1.8%), and a surplus of fracking equipment in the U.S. has driven down prices, but CEO David Lesar said in today's earnings call that growing demand in the Permian basin around Texas is helping to tighten that extra fracking capacity faster than expected; he says HAL won't have any problem filling its fracking calendar through the end of the year.For Q2, HAL expects low double-digit percentage revenue improvement and margins to move solidly into the mid-teens.HAL is reiterated a Conviction Buy at Goldman Sachs, citing better than expected Q1 North American pressure pumping revenues that showed 2% Q/Q growth despite weather interruptions and its view toward strong revenue growth during the remainder of the year.HAL makes up a hefty 11.9% of the Market Vectors Oil Service ETF (OIH +1.2%) and 10.4% of the iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services ETF (IEZ +1.1%).

Oilfield services firms eye busy Q2 on pent-up demand, Sterne Agee says
Halliburton (HAL +2.5%), Schlumberger (SLB +1.4%) and other oilfield services companies should see a busy Q2 due to pent-up demand following a wintry Q1, leading to a solid rise in Q2 and Q3 demand for completion services, including pressure pumping, coiled tubing and proppants, according to a report from Sterne Agee.The firm bases its outlook on reports of lower well counts during Q1, including a 2.5% sequential decline in well counts reported by Baker Hughes (BHI +1.7%); "this highlights our belief that wells per rig would drop in Q1 due to weather disruptions, and likely leads to a sharp rise in Q2 well completions."

Schlumberger among big winners in shale energy trend, Credit Suisse says
The move toward integrated oilfield services offerings is a hot topic in the energy industry, and the large OFS companies - Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) - are positioning themselves as one-stop shops for energy E&P customers, Credit Suisse says, believing it has spotted the biggest beneficiaries of the trend.SLB is the most levered toward the trend but its integrated project management business is underappreciated by investors, the firm says; ~5% of SLB's workforce is dedicated to IPM, meaning the revenue contribution should be at least 5% and the contribution to margin even greater.

Schlumberger expects Q1 earnings to jump from last year
Schlumberger (SLB +1.6%) CEO Paal Kibsgaard says he expects Q1 earnings to be much higher than in the same period last year, much of the growth coming from state-owned and independent energy companies that are spending to develop shale and other resources around the world, rather than multinational energy companies, most of whom are cutting spending.The positive outlook comes despite harsh weather in North America and Russia that hurt demand for SLB's drilling, completion and other services for oil and natural gas producers.Analyst consensus sees Q1 EPS of $1.22 after the company earned $1.01/share in Q1 2013.

Undervalued Schlumberger shares could rise 28%, Barron's writes
Despite a bright outlook, Schlumberger (SLB +1.2%) is undervalued by as much as 28%, Barron's writes; shares trade for 16x expected 2014 EPS of $5.70 and 13.5x 2015 estimated earnings, a discount to the S&P 500 as well as SLB's historical levels.Global demand for oil continues to grow, but increasingly reserves are located in areas that are hard to drill, a long-term boon for SLB's leading technologies; in the nearer term, big oil companies will spend more money in 2014 than in 2013 on SLB's services, and SLB continues to progress with its efficiency and reliability initiatives.SLB's international presence means it is more exposed to Brent crude oil prices, not WTI prices, which could suffer as U.S. product outstrips refining capacity.

Halliburton, Baker Hughes lifted by Strong Buy ratings at Raymond James
Halliburton (HAL +2.3%) and Baker Hughes (BHI +3.5%) enjoy a boost from Raymond James analysts who are big believers in the two oilfield services providers, upgrading both stocks to Strong Buy as likely to benefit from increases in prices for pressure pumping as demand for fracking services rises in the wake of the recent increases in natural gas prices.The firm updates its North American revenue growth assumptions for HAL to 20% in both 2014 and 2015 vs. prior estimates of 10% and 3%, and revises its EPS estimates $4.30 for 2014 and $5.85 for 2015, well above Wall Street consensus.BHI could grow its North American business at a 17% clip in 2014, the analysts say in placing an $80 price target on the shares.Wells Fargo has a slightly different take, downgrading HAL to Market Perform from Outperform on valuation; it prefers BHI and U.S. Silica (SLCA +1.3%) among companies that obtain a significant amount of their revenue from U.S. land drilling.Also rising today: SLB +3.5%, WFT +3.4%, FTK +4%.

U.S. warns over limits of easing on Iran sanctions
Schlumberger (SLB) finished shutting down its Iranian business in Q2 last year after losing $69M and facing a U.S. probe into its activities in several sanctioned countries, its latest 10-K filing shows; SLB says it has not bid on new Iranian oil contracts since early 2009.Economic sanctions against Iran had pushed other oilfield service firms such as Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to finish up their contracts and exit the country; last November, Weatherford (WFT) agreed to pay $252M in penalties for violating sanctions in Iran and other countries.Several of the world’s largest oil companies, such as BP and Shell, also pulled out of projects in Iran.Although the U.S. struck a six-month easing of some sanctions on Iran in November, officials are privately warning some of the same executives that any business now allowed with Iran must be limited to the six-month window of the deal.

Oilfield services' LatAm growth to struggle this year, Credit Suisse says
Latin America contributes a significant part to U.S.-based oil services and equipment companies (OIH), which will struggle to achieve growth in the region during 2014 as a slowdown in Mexico and Brazil will be worse than expected, Credit Suisse says.Halliburton (HAL) is in one of the most difficult positions because of its relatively high exposure to Mexico and Brazil, and its relatively low exposure to other Latin American markets will prevent it from mobilizing operations to more robust areas.Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford (WFT) have relatively high exposure to the two countries, but have the possibility of offsetting losses by moving business to other LatiAm countries.The firm says Baker Hughes (BHI) has the lowest exposure, with only 4% of its revenue from Mexico and Brazil.

Baker Hughes and Schlumberger up after earnings, Halliburton down
Three oil services firms - Halliburton (HAL -1.7%), Baker Hughes (BHI +4.7%) and Schlumberger (SLB +0.9%) - each reacted to news today with three very different responses.HAL's Q4 earnings beat estimates but shares slid largely because it cited several negative factors that are impacting its Latin America operations in 2014, Citi analysts say, yet the firm considers the selloff overdone and recommends being "opportunistic buyers" of HAL’s stock.BHI's Q4 results edged expectations but investors liked the details, including the company's outlook for increased activity in 2014, and BHI's Latin American numbers looked a lot better than HAL's.SLB was upgraded by Credit Suisse after announcing Q4 earnings last week, marked by a positive outlook and tone aided considerably by internal initiatives and efforts of better capital utilization and efficiency across the entire enterprise.

Expro said to attract Halliburton, Schlumberger, GE as Arle weighs sale
Expro International reportedly has attracted interest from Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and GE as U.K. buyout firm Arle Capital Partners prepares to sell its stake in the olfield services business.None of the potential buyers is believed to have made an actual offer for the business, which could fetch ~£3B ($4.9B), and although Arle is soliciting bids, the firm may wind up seeing an IPO as bringing the highest valuation.Energy services companies are attracting interest from potential acquirers as exploration expands in deepwater oil and gas fields and unconventional resources such as shale gas.

Schlumberger (SLB) +1.2% premarket after reporting a better than expected 22% jump in Q4 earnings on strong revenue from drilling activity in the Middle East and Asia.Revenue rose 7.4% to $11.91B, climbing 18% from the Middle East and Asia; international markets brought in about two-thirds of SLB's total 2013 revenue of $45.27B.Says a temporary shutdown of operations in southern Iraq in November following a protest slightly hurt Q4 results.In the U.S., SLB sees no change in fundamentals, with meaningful recovery in dry gas drilling activity "some way out in the future," CEO Paal Kibsgaard says; SLB has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include HAL, BHI and WFT.Yesterday, SLB declared a 28% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.40/share.

Goldman sees positive setup for Halliburton, Schlumberger, oil services
Goldman Sachs is out positive on oil service stocks (OIH) as earnings season begins, with negative investor sentiment creating a favorable setup for the sector.Among Goldman's reasons: WTI saturation is unlikely in 2014; negative revenue surprises during the year may be offset somewhat by positive margin surprises; and capex should rise by mid-single digits but companies with exposure to horizontal completions on U.S. land and with high Gulf of Mexico and Middle East exposure should see revenue growth at the upper end.The firm recommends owning Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) into earnings, and likes NBR, RES, CJES, BAS, PES and OII.

Sterne Agee selects its four favorite oil services stocks: HAL, SLB, OII, TTI
Sterne Agee believes non-conventional and deepwater drilling will rise steadily during the next few years, and it encourages investors to have exposure to both trends via the highest quality names and in companies with specific catalysts.The firm thinks WTI crude prices will remain in a fairly stable $85-$95 range over the next two years, rig growth will rise slightly in 2014 and accelerate in 2015, and deepwater drilling visibility will remain strong for several years.The firm's favorites are Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Oceaneering (OII), with Tetra Technologies (TTI) the top pick among sector small caps.

Baker Hughes moves higher despite downside Q4 guidance
Baker Hughes (BHI +0.6%) is holding up nicely despite guiding Q4 earnings below Wall Street consensus, as the November suspension of operations in Iraq following a protest incident at a facility belonging to one of BHI's units will cut profit by ~$80M.FBR Capital says it is a buyer of BHI and Schlumberger (SLB +0.5%) as such occasional, albeit painful, near-term disruptions are the risk side of both companies' long-term reward potential in Iraq (Briefing.com).However, Cowen believes BHI consensus 2014 EPS estimates of $4.14 are too high and likely will fall in coming weeks, further pressuring shares in the near term.

Deutsche Bank picks seven top oil services stocks for 2014
Oil services analysts at Deutsche Bank are very positive on the sector for next year, despite pervasive fears of weakening U.S. oil prices.Baker Hughes (BHI), Halliburton (HAL), Hercules Offshore (HERO) and Nabors Industries (NBR) are the firm's highest conviction choices and include price targets much higher than consensus; NBR's $27 target is the highest on Wall Street and would represent a 60% gain from current levels.The firm also sees strong upside potential in Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN), Pioneer Energy Services (PES) and Schlumberger (SLB).

Merrill Lynch offers energy themes to watch, and stocks to capitalize, in 2014
Energy stocks have underperformed this year, but Merrill Lynch analysts are reasonably positive on the sector for 2014, pointing to some key themes:With the price of gas likely to remain in a narrow range next year, the firm says investors should buy high-quality, large resource-based stocks such as COG and RRC.The net asset value race is over, and the coming year is about execution, ML says, seeing PXD and WLL as winners here.Following 2013's wave of activism, the firm sees gains in HES and OXY.Favorable outlooks for E&P budgets could lift oilfield services stocks focused on North America, such as HAL and SLB.The ML team sees crude production rising to the highest level since 1989, and pinpoints TSO and VLO as the refiners to benefit the most in 2014 because they're crude-advantaged and have stock-specific catalysts.Finally, the firm suggests investors with significant gains in CVX may want to take those and buy XOM for 2014.

Barclays is bullish on oil services, raises price targets
Barclays expects the oil services group (OIH) to significantly outperform the broader equity market over the next several years, and raises its price targets for several sector leaders (Briefing.com).The industry remains in the early days of a prolonged global upcycle, the firm says, and consequently market fundamentals should favor oil services, equipment and drilling companies.SLB target to $138 from $124; SPN to $42 from $39; OII to $103 from $96; NOV to $102 from $93; HAL to $86 from $76; GLF to $63 from $58; DRQ to $77 from $64; CAM to $82 from $77; CJES to $34 from $30; BHI to $81 from $71.

Managed shale offers opportunity for oil services
Managed Shale is a new term from Credit Suisse suggesting the risk from shale production has shifted from exploration and production to oilfield services - i.e., the onus is now on these firms to deliver better wells and reduce nonproductive time.OFS companies will be paid under an integrated, risk-based contract scenario in which they manage all aspects of development and are paid through production-sharing agreements, says the team. WIthin its coverage universe, those best positioned are Baker Hughes (BHI -1.7%), Halliburton (HAL -2.8%), and Schlumberger (SLB -2.2%).Back of envelope: With about $100B of oilfield service spending on unconventionals, if HAL gained 14% market share and generated 30% margins, EBITDA could increase $840M to about $12 per share.

Iraq violence forces oil services halt
Baker Hughes (BHI) says it has suspended operations in Iraq following a weekend protest at a facility near the southern town of Basra, and Reuters reports Schlumberger (SLB) may have followed suit.Iraq has been ripped by growing instability as Syria’s civil war spills over into the country, reigniting the sectarian conflict that had raged until 2007, and the moves are a serious setback for Iraq's oil industry which had been slowly rebuilding itself.

Outlook for Saudi drilling has oil service companies lining up
Saudi Aramco is reportedly set to raise the rig count in Saudi Arabia to more than 200 by the end of next year and energy service companies are ready to take advantage of the opportunity.Saudi Arabia is under pressure to plug a supply hole left by disruptions in Libya, Iran, Nigeria, and Yemen and "is investing heavily to preserve the world's largest spare oil production capacity cushion at more than 2M bpd," Reuters says.
Industry heavyweights looking to capitalize on a potential boom in drilling include: Halliburton (HAL), Nabors (NBR), Rowan (RDC), Ensco (ESV), Baker Hughes (BHI), and Schlumberger (SLB). Oct. 27, 2013, 2:39 PM | 1 Comment

Halliburton shares slip after North American results disappoint
Halliburton (HAL) -1.1% premarket despite a 17% Y/Y increase in Q3 earnings and a 5% boost in revenues.Q3 revenue rose 5% Y/Y to $7.47B due to a strong performance in its eastern hemisphere operations, where revenue rose 17% and operating income climbed 30% Y/Y, but North American revenue rose a tepid 1.6% and operating income gained 18%; North America contributes more than half of HAL revenues and ~60% of its profits, a larger share than competitors Baker Hughes (BHI) and Schlumberger (SLB).HAL says the U.S. land rig count remains sluggish, and oversupply of service capacity in North America continues to put pressure on pricing in a number of areas, but it expects margins to strengthen next year.

IHS: 23 non-North American shale oil plays hold potential 175B barrels
Schlumberger (SLB +1%), Halliburton (HAL -0.1%), Baker Hughes (BHI +0.9%) and other oilfield services firms (OIH) could benefit from an expected shale boom overseas, as an IHS report says Argentina, Russia and Algeria have shale deposits that hold even more oil than North America.Twenty-three tight oil plays across the globe are likely to hold 175B barrels in reserves, IHS says; it's too early to know how much could be commercially recovered, but the potential is significant compared to the 43B barrels of commercially recoverable resources of tight oil estimated in North America.Extraction costs overseas are far higher than in the U.S. or Canada; IHS estimates an average tight oil well in North America costs $5.6M vs. $8M globally and more than $13M in the Arabian peninsula.

UBS highlights top energy stocks to benefit from Middle East turmoil

Schlumberger, Halliburton may be early beneficiaries of Mexican oil reforms
Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) posted solid gains today after Mexico said it wants to open the door to greater involvement by foreign companies following a seven-decade state oil monopoly.Oil service companies like SLB and HAL, which do the initial grunt-work and aren't interested in owning reserves, would see the earliest returns, Liam Denning writes; deepwater specialists such as Chevron (CVX) and Statoil (STO) could benefit over time.The reforms are hardly a done deal: The government is launching a public relations effort to convince a skeptical populace that Mexico, the country that invented oil nationalism, won't be selling out to foreigners.

The U.S. Justice Department is examining potential antitrust issues in the market for pressure pumping services, according to Baker Hughes (BHI), owner of the third-largest pressure pumping fleet. The market for the equipment has been oversupplied for more than a year after slumping natural gas prices led to a slowdown in gas-directed drilling, but 2011 saw a push to add capacity in response to a ramp-up in fracking.

The CEO says he still expects SLB to grow international operations by ~10% this year, with "strong and consistent growth" in sub-Saharan Africa, Russia, China and Australia. (earnings)

More on Schlumberger's (SLB) Q1 results: “The outlook for North America remains uncertain, with lower-than-expected rig activity and continuing pricing weakness," CEO Paal Kibsgaard says. Oilfield services revenue from North America, the region which generates most of the top-line, fell 4.2% to $3.29B. Overall drilling revenue was $4.1B, up 9% Y/Y but flat Q/Q. Shares +0.5% premarket.

Despite the weak YTD start in oil service companies Baker Hughes (BHI), Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford (WFT), Barclays analyst James West makes a strong case for all four in the months ahead. The group trades at 13.2x forward earnings, ~20% less than the 10-year average, and shares also are cheap relative to commodity prices, West says.

A widely expected Q1 rebound for oil services companies (OIH) is not materializing, analysts say, as the U.S. land rig count fell ~3% Q/Q in Q1 and was 13% lower Y/Y. Now the view is that recovery will be slower rather than faster. Fresh off a wave of downward analyst revisions, Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) report on Friday, while Halliburton (HAL) posts earnings next week.

Schlumberger (SLB -2%) got a great deal on acreage in Texas’ Eagle Ford shale, Jefferies calculates, with an implied valuation of ~$3,300/acre vs. more than $20K/acre in recent Eagle Ford deals by other companies. SLB may not make other similar deals, but the Forest Oil (FST -3.5%) agreement is good "advertising" for its "smarter" approach toward unconventional energy sources.

For investors interested in oilfield services companies, Simmons analysts provide their share-price entry points for the sector's top names - SLB, HAL, BHI, WFT, CAM, FTI, NOV - and finds all look fairly valued with 2013 likely to be a murky year. But "most of these names are good solid buys on weakness," the firm says, and that’s where the entry points help.

Drillers are little more than range-bound trading vehicles for now, Dan Dicker says in urging investors to avoid the group. Despite excitement over new U.S. finds, the weak price of natural gas will continue to stifle drilling growth until some price recovery past $3.50/mcf arrives. SLB and others have done a good job squeezing growth from international markets, but a robust U.S. market is key for their stocks to take off.

Oilfield services companies suffer another down day after Schlumberger (SLB -1.3%) sounded an alarm for the sector, warning that customers have reactivated fewer rigs than expected and pricing is still an issue. It was a “clarion call of realism," Simmons says, virtually ensuring negative Q1 guidance from SLB and making positive revisions from other oil service firms "a steeper climb." HAL -1.9%, BHI -1.3%.

Schlumberger (SLB -2.4%) warns that North American activity is coming in weaker than expected in Q1, with fewer rigs going back to work. Asset utilization has recovered from a holiday slowdown and lower cost for guar, a key ingredient used in fracking, is providing some relief, but pricing remains the fundamental issue, CEO Paul Kibsgaard tells an energy conference. HAL -1.5%, BHI -2%, WFT -1.9%.

The oil industry is increasing spending on research it hopes will make it cheaper and easier to coax more crude and natural gas from shale formations and deep-sea oil fields. [HAL]], SLB and BHI raised their R&D budgets 24% from 2010 to a combined $2.1B in 2012. Small improvements in drilling tools and fracking techniques could boost profits for oilfield firms and provide more energy for global markets.

A closer look at China’s plans to unlock what could be the world’s biggest shale gas reserves shows shows 16 firms winning exploration rights in the latest auction had never drilled a gas well before. They have little idea about the costs, but they're "getting in early into what could be a huge market." It also offers the potential for lucrative contracts for specialist foreign firms such as SLB or HAL. Mar. 11, 2013, 6:05 PM | 2 Comments
Regardless if Carl Icahn succeeds in pressuring Transocean (RIG) into paying a richer dividend, Barron's Dimitra DeFotis thinks the stock looks cheap, particularly vs. rival Schlumberger (SLB). RIG shares trade at 11.4x estimated 2013 EPS of $4.65, and only 8.8x estimated $5.94 in 2014; that's earnings growth of 27%. SLB trades at ~16x estimated 2013 EPS of $4.74 and 13x estimated $5.85 in 2014.

UBS expects Halliburton's (HAL) dividend hike - its first since 2007 - could lead other oilfield companies to follow suit later this year, particularly Ensco (ESV), which now pays $1.50/share but could raise it to $2 or $2.50. Schlumberger (SLB), which increased dividends last month by 14%, also will seek to regularly raise its dividend in coming years as free cash flows grow, the firm says.

Analysts believe top oilfield services companies are poised for takeoff. Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) are seen as having room to grow even after recent run-ups, while the view is more mixed on Baker Hughes (BHI), which has less international exposure and has lagged behind in making the shift from gas to oil drilling in North America.

Halliburton (HAL +4.6%) hits a 52-week high following upside Q4 results, leading the oil services (OIH +1.5%) and energy (XLE +0.8%) sectors; peers SLB and BHI also move up. Barclays sees up-and-coming offshore drillers Atwood Oceanics (ATW), Ocean Rig (ORIG) and Pacific Drilling (PACD) coming along for the ride as ways to gain exposure to the global proliferation of offshore drilling.

Schlumberger's (SLB +0.6%) price target is raised to $100 from $92 by FBR Capital, which believes SLB's 2013 outlook bodes well for oilfield service stocks (OIH). The firm thinks 2013's biggest potential surprise will be a rebound in U.S. land activity, and SLB's conference call comments support its belief the U.S. well count should be up strongly in a flat E&P capex environment.

Gas and oil rigs in the U.S. dropped for the eighth straight week to the lowest level since March 2011, according to Baker Hughes' (BHI) latest rig count.

As the rig count "fell off a cliff" last month, oilfield services firms (OIH) have resigned themselves to dismal Q4 earnings, and Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have tried to prepare investors for the blow. With the market for services still oversupplied, analysts say the North American land drilling recovery will take time to work through, but 2013 should prove less gloomy as the year progresses.

Among energy companies tracked by 24/7, the sharpest increases in short interest came in top pipeline MLPs Kinder Morgan (KMP) and Enterprise (EPD).
