Lockheed's satellite propulsion system under U.S. Air Force review
The U.S. Air Force says it has opened a review of the propulsion systems used for Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) military satellites following an undisclosed problem during a recent attempt to boost one into orbit.The review is focused on operations that boost into proper orbit military satellites that use LMT’s A2100 propulsion system, and is meant to ensure that LMT's first new GPS III satellite is ready to launch next year, the USAF says.The review has delayed again the Air Force’s acceptance of the new GPS satellite, which already is 34 months late.

Citi cautions on chasing defense stocks; downgrades NOC, GD, HII
General Dynamics (GD +1.4%), Northrop Grumman (NOC -0.1%) and Huntington Ingalls (HII +0.6%) are all downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Citigroup, citing stretched valuations and limited upside potential following expectations for higher military spending under Pres. Trump.After years with a positive take on defense names, TheFly.com reports that Citi has turned more neutral on the group, citing a potential disconnect in investor expectations for industry growth as the market may expect too much too soon in industry growth, noting that the near and mid-term outlook remains challenged by budget constraints and a slow procurement process.It is still not entirely clear what Trump wants, and the Defense Department is putting pressure on contractors to innovate and control costs, which introduces more risk into the prime contractor business models as R&D and capex rises.Even so, Citi reiterates Buy ratings on Harris (HRS +0.8%), L3 Technologies (LLL +0.8%), Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.5%) and Raytheon (RTN +0.6%).

Lockheed F-35 reliability pulled down by early versions, U.S. official says
The overall reliability of Lockheed Martin's (LMT -0.3%) F-35 fighter jets is being pulled down by initial versions of the aircraft which do not perform as well as more recently delivered jets, according to the program's head at the Pentagon.The program has suffered extensive delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined as production increased and should fall to $80M by 2020 from $94.6M currently, Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan says.The first F-35 aircraft were delivered to the U.S. military in 2011, and some of those earlier aircraft underperform newer models that contain production advances, Bogdan says.The F-35 will make its first public appearance in Australia at an airshow on Friday, but it will not be permanently based in the country until December 2018.

Last February it was awarded a $20M contract to test technology that makes sonic booms practically unnoticeable to people on the ground.

Analyst: Lockheed could log future protest after Trump's F-35 Boeing call
Pres. Trump's Jan. 17 phone conversation with the Defense Department's F-35 program manager and Boeing (BA +1.1%) CEO Dennis Muilenburg could give Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.4%) and other defense contractors possible grounds for protest in future competitions, an analyst says.Bloomberg reported this week that Muilenburg was listening in on the call with Trump, who has attacked LMT's fighter program over its costs and suggested it would compete against Boeing's Super Hornet.Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says Boeing potentially could have learned information unknown to other potential competitors, giving it an advantage in future competitions.While LMT has no current grounds for legal action, if a future competition pitted its F-35C against an advanced Boeing Super Hornet, then LMT would have every right to ask to know what Boeing's CEO heard during the call and could give LMT grounds for a bid protest.Steven Schooner, a George Washington professor of government procurement law, says the call does not appear to have broken the law but it could damage trust between the Pentagon and its industry partners.

Lockheed criticized by Air Force for latest GPS III satellite flaws
Botched testing by subcontractor Harris (HRS -0.3%) has forced another delay in the delivery of the first of 32 new GPS III satellites until later this month and raises new questions about contractor Lockheed Martin’s (LMT +0.4%) supervision of the project, according to the U.S. Air Force’s chief of space programs.The Air Force says HRS spent several months last year doing follow-up testing on the wrong parts instead of samples of suspect capacitors installed on the first three satellites.LMT has a contract to build the first 10 of the satellites, but the program’s latest setback may affect a pending Air Force decision on whether to open the final 22 satellites to competition from Boeing (BA -1.5%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), Bloomberg reports.

Lockheed's F-35 deal adds to pressure to cut production costs
Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) new deal with the Pentagon for F-35 fighters cuts the purchase price by nearly 8% but still should be profitable for the company, but the ~$8.7B agreement will step up the pressure on LMT to continue cutting F-35 production costs and risks margin erosion, analysts says.The lot 10 deal for a total of 90 jets cuts the price on the F-35A to $94.6M/plane, or a 7.3% price reduction from the previous lot 9 terms, marking the first time the F-35A variant has been below $100M and representing a 60%-plus price drop since the first production lot.Morningstar's Chris Higgins says the F-35 program is still profitable for LMT and likely will remain so but he expects there's a question about whether the company will be able to expand margins as quickly as before.Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr says lot 10 "appears to be in line with expectations," and that the deal "supports firming F-35 prospects" and suggests possible Lockheed's Aeronautics division "upside in 2018-19."

Lagging Lockheed Martin offers buy opportunity, Argus analyst says
Relative weakness in Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.6%) shares over the past quarter offers a buying opportunity, says Argus analyst John Eade as he maintains a Buy rating with a $290 price target.Eade believes the stock faces ongoing headline risk, given that LMT’s F-35 fighter jet program has been targeted by Pres. Trump, but says "management has a history of managing through challenges," and a Republican House, Senate and White House should bode well for defense spending.The firm has a favorable view of LMT’s focus on international revenue diversification, and expects increased geopolitical tension to benefit sales and earnings going forward.At the same time, RBC maintains a Sector Perform rating on the shares, saying LMT's initial 2017 EPS guidance was a slight disappointment after its outlook for 5%-7% revenue growth issued in October.

Morgan analyst Seth Seifman says; also, LMT has a track record of providing an initially conservative assessment of the year and then beating its guidance, defense analyst Douglas Rothacker tells Bloomberg.CEO Marillyn Hewson said in today's earnings conference call that the price of the F-35A models being used by the U.S. Air Force and most overseas buyers would fall below $100M, in-line with the Pentagon’s target for a 6%-7% sequential drop, and is working with suppliers to lower expenses to $85M per jet by 2019.

Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) F-35 jet “has come a long way” since earlier “grotesque” cost overruns and schedule delays, departing Secretary of Defense Carter said in an appraisal at odds with the view of Pres.-elect Trump.Because the $379B program is critical to three U.S. military services and many allied air forces, “it’s essential that it perform both in technology and in cost terms, and we’ve got to keep working on that,” Carter tells Bloomberg.“If we stay on course, no other fighter aircraft in the world will come close to competing with” the F-35 “for performance and cost, and we will wipe out all competition," Carter says.

Lockheed Martin falls after Trump again targets F-35 cost
Lockheed Martin (LMT -1.3%) is lower after Pres.-elect Trump again criticized the cost of its F-35 fighter jet program during today's press conference.The F-35 is "way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget," Trump said. "We're going to do some big things on the F-35 program and perhaps the F-18 program. We're going to get those costs way down."LMT shares fell 2% on Dec. 12 when Trump first put the company in his crosshairs. Wed, Jan. 11, 12:38 PM | 22 Comments
F-35 needs rigorous review from Trump, Pentagon testing director says
The incoming Trump administration should “rigorously and comprehensively review” Lockheed Martin’s (LMT +0.4%) F-35 jet, the Defense Department’s outgoing director of combat testing says, citing the fighter’s “significant, well-documented deficiencies in critical combat capabilities” in a letter to the House Armed Services Committee.The DoD’s F-35 program office “has no plan to adequately fix and verify hundreds of these deficiencies using flight testing within its currently planned schedule and resources,” the director says, adding that the deployment of F-35s “with capable mission systems is critical to our national security” but the program “is at high risk of sacrificing essential combat performance.”The Pentagon’s office of independent cost analysis estimates that extending the development phase from its planned test flight completion in September 2017 to as late as 2020 could cost as much as an additional $1.12B.

WSJ: Boeing, Lockheed benefiting from airstrikes against Islamic State
Boeing (BA -0.3%), Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.6%) and BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY +1.2%) are benefiting from the U.S. military's increased reliance on air power in the fight against ISIS, as they ramp up production of precision guidance kits that carry missiles and bombs to their targets, WSJ reports.The campaign has strained U.S. supplies of the three preferred precision-guided munitions: LMT’s hellfire missile, and Boeing’s small-diameter bomb and joint direct attack munition, or JDAM, according to the report.The munitions are not cheap: Equipped with sophisticated laser or GPS targeting technology, a single bomb or missile can cost as much as $115M, and the U.S. Air Force has spent ~$2B in precision guided munitions and dropped more than 40K in the bombing campaign against Islamic State since August 2014, according to Air Force officials.Boeing says it is producing ~120 GPS guidance kits for the JDAM each day at its plant outside St. Louis, up from ~40 in early 2015, and expects a continuing ramp-up will take JDAM production rates to their highest since the early days of the Iraq War.

F-35 cost overruns "in the past," says Air Force program chief
Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 fighter jet program is essential for the security of the U.S. and its allies, and the program is now under control after years of delays, says Air Force Lt.Gen. Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Defense Department.Pres.-elect Trump's tweet last week (I, II) that "the F-35 program and cost is out of control" sank shares of LMT and other defense companies and fanned concerns that the new administration would cut defense contractors' profit margins as well as broader federal spending.Bogdan says the notion that program is out of control is "in the past," acknowledging the first F-35s cost twice as much as expected, but that the problems largely ended in 2011.The general says his team had not met Trump transition officials but that costs could be cut further beyond ongoing efforts that reduced the latest per-plane price of the model used by the Air Force to $102M.

Lockheed's F-35 program still an option for Canada, Trudeau says
Canada will consider Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 program in an open competition for fighter jets, Prime Minister Trudeau says, despite domestic and foreign criticism about the program's cost that long pre-dated U.S. Pres.-elect Trump's objections.Trudeau had promised during last year's election that he would not buy F-35s because the planes were too expensive, but the Liberal government has since softened its position and said that all suppliers could bid to replace its aging fighter CF-18 jet fleet.Still, Canada snubbed LMT last month when it unveiled plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while it started the fighter jet competition over again.

Rough session for defense ETFs as Trump takes on F-35 costs
Not only is F-35 maker Lockheed Martin slumping after the president-elect said costs are out of control, but program suppliers like Northrop Grumann, UTX, and BAE Systems are down.The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA -1.3%), the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR -1.5%), the PowerShares ETF Trust Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (PPA -1.4%).Presciently on Friday, JPMorgan was out with a cautious note on Lockheed Martin (LMT -3.1%), suggesting it was next in line for a Trump tweet. The negative impact, however, could be short-lived: "While [the DoD] can push for tougher terms, there is no alternative to F-35 for the U.S. and its allies ... In a worst case, F-35 margins will disappoint but the build rate should increase substantially. Nevertheless, administration efforts to change the contracting equation are a risk for the whole industry and one we’ll be monitoring.”

F-35 suppliers also slide following derisive Trump tweet
Pres.-elect Trump's broadside (I, II) against the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons system isn't just slamming Lockheed Martin (LMT -3.4%); nearly every major defense contractor except Boeing has exposure to the F-35 fighter jet program.Northrop Grumann (NOC -3.8%), a major supplier to the F-35, is suffering comparable losses, and suppliers United Technologies (UTX -0.1%) and BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY -1.5%) also are lower."Trump has clearly learned that bully pulpit of Twitter can be pretty powerful," says Cowen defense stock analyst Cai von Rumoh. "Defense is in essence a political business, so if the president or president-elect says you're asking too much money, people worry."But investors should not panic over F-35’s prospects based on a single Trump tweet, says Byron Callan, a defense analyst at Capital Alpha: “Stating that costs are ‘out of control’ is wrong. Yes, there are affordability issues on the F-35 and there may be alternative ways to deliver capabilities offered by the F-35 through other platforms or weapons. However, unit prices have been declining, and the program has stabilized in recent years.” Dec. 12, 2016, 1:13 PM | 90 Comments

"Presumably he won't comment on all defense contracts but will focus on high profile programs. However, given his power as president, this can have an impact on specific programs."LMT's F-35 program has long been criticized for its $400B development and acquisition price tag, and NOC's B-21 bomber recently has been hit for not disclosing a fuller estimate on its cost, which analysts estimate at $50B-$80B.

Pentagon providing misleading answers on F-35, testing chief says
Defense Department officials have been preparing a misleading assessment of progress on Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE:LMT) F-35 weapons program, the DoD’s chief tester warns, a position at odds with the Pentagon’s narrative that the program is on course after earlier problems.Among several assertions challenged in a DoD draft response to questions about F-35 testing from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman McCain: Claims that operational combat testing that all weapons systems must pass will start in mid-2018 and be completed a year later are “false,” as the tests will commence “no sooner than late 2018, or, more likely, in early 2019 but could be as late as 2020.”Pres.-elect Trump must decide next year whether to meet the Pentagon's request to increase F-35 production to 70 in FY 2018 from 63 this year; Trump, who just complained about "out of control" costs of the new Air Force One, also has raised some questions in the past about the F-35.

Expect big changes for NASA under Trump
"Given the outcome of the congressional election and learning more specifically who is (and isn’t) involved as space advisers, I anticipate a larger appetite for a change agenda and a better than expected potential to get at least some of their agenda accomplished," Lori Garver, former No.2 at NASA writes.Expected areas of change: i) NASA’s bureaucracy/infrastructure is much too large and expensive. ii) NASA shouldn’t be spending so much money on Earth sciences. iii) The Moon is a better and more important destination than Mars. iv) Entrepreneurial space should play a larger role in all aspects of space. v) Space activities cut across international, civil, military and commercial arenas and should be run out of the White House, by a National Space Council, reporting to Vice President Pence.She also takes a few parting shots at the departing administration: "NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden’s perceived lack of enthusiastic support of the White House agenda gave an opening to the opposition. Without a willingness to take on these special interests, the administration made a Faustian bargain to secure congressional support for Earth sciences, technology and commercial crew, in exchange for support of developing a large expendable rocket (the Space Launch System or SLS) and deep space capsule (Orion) for human spaceflight.  While these parochial interests still exist, a Trump White House has the opportunity to more effectively defend its own agenda."Stocks potentially impacted: AVAV, B, BA, GLOB, HON, I, JEC, LMT, OTCPK:MDDWF, MOG.A, OA, SAIC, SPACE, T

Lockheed Martin upgraded to Buy from Hold at Stifel
Lockheed Martin (LMT +2.2%) is upgraded to Buy from Hold with a $290 price target, raised from $260, at Stifel, which cites encouraging commentary about 2018 free cash flow and to a lesser degree the outcome of the election, which could drive incremental defense spending dollars to LMT.Given LMT's continued strong execution on F-35, Stifel says it is less concerned about recent pressure associated with news that F-35 contract terms were more onerous than expected, and it suspects that higher volumes should additional aircraft be added to LRIPs will offset any modest potential margin pressure in 2018.

Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) are upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight, and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is upgraded to Equal Weight from Underweight at Barclays, as the Trump victory arguably gives new life to a bullish trade that's now less based on safe-haven status and more on absolute vs. relative growth.Details on budget and national security changes under Trump are scarce, but Barclays believes the market will assign a 100% probability to the prospect of higher defense budgets in the near future; for defense stocks, the near term is not about fundamentals or estimate revisions per se - which the firm thinks will not change much - but instead about the simplistic view that defense spending under Trump will be higher.Also, the firm shifts its neutral posture on defense to positive, on the belief that shares stay well bid in short-to-medium term.

Trump and the defense sector
Donald Trump has called for eliminating the sequester on defense spending and initiating a military buildup, boosting troop levels and the number of ships and aircraft.He seeks to fully offset the cost through "common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks" and additional payments from countries where the U.S. has military bases, including Germany, Saudi Arabia and Japan.Premarket movement: LMT +4.5%, RTN +1.7%, GD, BA, NOC, OA, HII, HON, UTX, OTCPK:EADSF, ITT, TXT, LLL, OTCPK:BAESY, OTCPK:FINMY, COL#Election2016

Lockheed battle with Pentagon over F-35 price could depress profits
Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.1%) shares have shed nearly 3% since the Defense Department ended more than year of talks with the company and said it was imposing a new $6.1B deal for the next batch of 57 F-35 jet fighters that start delivering next year.The deal is by far the largest the Pentagon has struck without reaching agreement with its supplier, contracting experts say, and LMT says it plans to evaluate its options, which could include a court appeal.The core of the impasse is the Pentagon’s take on how much the jets cost to build and how much profit is afforded to LMT; the terms cut the average cost of a each F-35 airframe - not including the engine - to near its target of $100M, and the DoD aims to lower this to well below $80M by 2019.The fighters would be purchased for 3.7% less than the previous lot, potentially squeezing margins for LMT’s largest source of profit, says Jefferies defense analyst Howard Rubel; the F-35 accounted for 23% of LMT’s revenue through September, and the total likely will reach 25% next year, he says.

Lockheed Martin wins $6B-plus DoD contract for F-35 fighter jets
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has concluded negotiations with the U.S. Defense Department on a contract for 57 F-35 fighter jets after 14 months of negotiations on the $6.1B-plus deal.Reuters reports the contract will provide profit margin certainty to LMT and its partners - including Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), Pratt & Whitney (NYSE:UTX) and BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF, OTCPK:BAESY) - who have been producing the jet under a placeholder agreement.However, LMT says the contract was "not a mutually agreed upon contract, it was a unilateral contract action, which obligates us to perform under standard terms and conditions, and previously agreed-to items."Another production contract, a 94-plane deal, is said to remain under negotiation.

F-35 needs another half billion dollars?
The Pentagon will need as much as $500M extra to finish the development phase for Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35, the most expensive U.S. weapons system ever.The F-35 program office made the request during a closed-door review last month by the Defense Acquisition Board, according to Bloomberg.The call comes as the Pentagon's chief weapons tester issued a fresh warning that the aircraft, projected to cost $379B for a fleet of 2,443 U.S. planes, is far from showing it has full combat capability.

Northrop’s $80B bomber award spelled out in declassified U.S. ruling
Northrop Grumman's (NYSE:NOC) winning bid to develop and build the U.S. Air Force's new bomber held “significant structural advantages” over a competing proposal by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), according to a declassified version of a February ruling from the Government Accountability Office.The “significantly lower proposed prices” for initial production “created a near-insurmountable obstacle” to Boeing in the Air Force’s calculation of realistic costs, according to the GAO report, which also said its review of Boeing’s protest filed after the award to NOC "provides no basis on which to sustain the protest.”After rejecting Boeing’s challenge for the bomber program valued at as much as $80B, the GAO initially had kept its findings secret.

Lockheed Martin soars after foreseeing 7% revenue gain next year
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) soared 7.3% in the stock's best showing in seven years, after Q3 results easily topped Wall Street estimates and the company raised its full-year outlook.LMT's "outlook for 7% revenue growth next year is pretty impressive," says Bloomberg aerospace and defense analyst Douglas Rothacker. “You’d be hard-pressed to find a defense contractor generating growth like that.”"The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world," CEO Marillyn Hewson said during today's earnings conference call.Overall, Hewson says LMT's biggest growth area remains the F-35 followed by missile defense; only 10 F-35s were produced in Q3 vs. 12 for the year-ago quarter, which management attributes to a problem with the insulation in the plane's fuel lines and fuel tanks, and the subsequent fix.Other defense stocks rose today on the back of LMT's positive results; NOC +1.4% and RTN +1.5% are due to report quarterly results later this week.

Boeing exec: Canada scrutinizing data for new fighter contract

"It gave all of the suppliers a chance to set down in black and white what it is their platform does," adding that Boeing had been in a "ping-pong" set of questioning from the government.Canada's new Liberal government had pledged not to buy the Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.1%) F-35s that it had been, calling them expensive and unnecessary.Lockheed and Boeing are among five companies invited to submit data on areas including capabilities and economic benefits of competing programs.Boeing is selling the benefits of work opportunities that would be provided for Canadian firms, and Allen didn't rule out giving work to Bombardier (OTCQX:BDRAF -0.7%).

Lockheed Martin upgrade at Wells Fargo, which eyes $20 EPS by 2020

"Combat ready" F-35 grounded as insulation flaw found during maintenance
Seven weeks after the U.S. Air Force declared its first F-35 jets combat ready, at least 10 of the fighter jets are grounded after service mechanics discovered “peeling and crumbling" insulation wrapped around lines that carry liquid to cool combat systems and computers.The poor insulation is suspected on 57 aircraft, including 42 on Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) production line, Bloomberg reports.The Air Force says the issue is not a design flaw with the aircraft but instead caused by manufacturing quality glitches with one of two subcontractors that make the 18 lines through which the coolant flows.LMT says the problem is “confined to one supplier source and one batch of parts,”but does not identify the subcontractor involved.

New GPS satellite delivery to be at least 32 months late
The U.S. Air Force’s first new GPS satellite, already 28 months late, missed its most recent delivery date and will not be shipped until at least December because a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) failed to conduct testing on a key part years ago.The officer in charge of the program says testing of the part, a ceramic capacitor, should have been completed as long as five years ago, including evaluating how long it will operate without failing; ~600 of the capacitors are on the initial satellite, which cost $529M.While the Air Force has a commitment for LMT to build the first 10 of the 32 new satellites planned, delays contributed to the decision earlier this year to review which other companies might be capable of building the remaining 22; the officer says the Air Force will decide by February whether to stick with LMT.

Lockheed F-35 "on a path toward failing to deliver," Pentagon chief tester says
While the U.S. Air Force has declared its version of Lockheed Martin’s (LMT -0.5%) F-35 jet ready for limited combat operations, the Defense Department's director of operational testing warns that full combat capabilities are "at a substantial risk" of missing deadlines.“The program is actually not on a path toward success but instead on a path toward failing to deliver” the aircraft’s full capabilities, “for which the Department is paying almost $400B by the scheduled end” of its development in 2018, the DoD’s director of operational testing said in an Aug. 9 memo obtained by Bloomberg.The F-35 is expected to reach full operational capability during 2021-22, but the memo places the timeline in doubt as problems with software and other systems continue.Goldman Sachs outlines concerns about LMT, including the F-35, valuation, and headwinds to consensus earnings and cash flow estimates.

"Clinton is hawkish, and she's seen as likely supporting a strong military. And we know that Trump is in favor of expanding the military.""Defense spending is more about the threat and the state of your equipment than who is in the White House," added Richard Safran, director at Buckingham Research.

U.K. defense secretary urges U.S. to approve Lockheed F-35 jets
The U.K. remains firmly committed to buying 138 Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) F-35 jets in spite of currency fluctuations caused by last month’s Brexit vote, but is pressing the U.S. Department of Defense to wrap up negotiations over the next two contracts for the potential $15B purchase.U.K. Defense Secretary Fallon says he is "chomping at the bit to get on with” the contracts, which would include nine short-takeoff and vertical-landing aircraft, noting that there is no alternative aircraft that can operate off the country’s two new aircraft carriers being specially outfitted to launch and recover them.The Pentagon has been negotiating with LMT since last year over a ninth and 10th production contract; U.K.-based companies including BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF, OTCPK:BAESY) produce ~15% of each aircraft as part of work-share agreements.LMT said yesterday that it is negotiating final contract terms but that current funding is “insufficient to cover the production process," and that it has ~$900M of potential cash exposure and $3B in termination liability exposure related to the contracts.

Lockheed Martin could raise guidance again this year, analyst says
Lockheed Martin (LMT -1.1%) just reported a Q2 earnings beat and raised its guidance, and Argus analyst John Eade thinks LMT could announce another upward revision to its forecasts as the year progresses.Argus maintains a Buy rating LMT while raising the price target to $290 from $255, as it assumes continued strong earnings based on increased U.S. and international defense spending.LMT has agreed to combine its government IT infrastructure services business with Leidos, a move Eade says would include a stock split-off that should unlock ~$5B in enterprise value for LMT shareholders.Nearly 80% of the company’s revenues come from defense spending by the U.S. government, and “recent budget trends have been generally supportive for the industry,” Eade adds.

Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.4%) is higher following its better than expected Q2 results but warns that the current level of production of F-35 combat jets cannot be sustained without a new contract from the Department of Defense.LMT said in today's earnings conference call that it has been in talks with the Pentagon and is optimistic a contract will come soon, but the uncertainty surrounding the key program sliced into an earlier 3% gain and a 52-week high.LMT CEO Marillyn Hewson said on the call that she did not foresee harm to its business prospects in Turkey following last week's failed coup; Turkey has committed $195M to the program and has commitments to order 116 of the jets, and LMT also manufactures components including parts of the center fuselage in the country.

Price of F-35 jets down 57%, Lockheed Martin CEO says
The price of Lockheed Martin's (LMT +1.3%) F-35 fighter jet has dropped 57% as commercial sales ramp up, and "we're on a path to be down to a price of an $85M jet by 2019, which is comparable to a fourth generation aircraft," CEO Marillyn Hewson tells CNBC from the Farnborough air show.The CEO says LMT expects to sell 3,000 jets in coming decades, with production likely peaking at 170-180 planes/year around 2023, as countries around the world do not see global security challenges diminishing.Also, the U.S. Defense Department says it is extending by two years a project of cost-cutting initiatives for the Pentagon's costliest arms program, which includes an agreement by LMT and key suppliers Northrop Grumman (NOC +0.4%) and BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY +1.4%) to invest up to $250M in projects aimed at cutting the cost of operating and maintaining the jets, with a goal of saving $1B over five years.Shares earlier hit $256.32, an all-time high.

Report: Boeing, Lockheed eye $40B Japan fighter jet tender
Boeing (BA +0.1%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.2%) reportedly are among those invited to submit a proposal as Japan plans to acquire new fighter jets in a deal that could be worth as much as $40B.Japan is expected to launch a tender for ~100 fighter jets in the coming weeks as the country seeks to bolster its air defenses amid rising tension with China over disputed maritime borders.Touted as a replacement for existing Mitsubishi F-2 multi-role fighter jets, the new warplane will operate alongside LMT F-35 fighters that Japan has on order, as well as BA F-15Js jets it is upgrading; analysts say Japan's preference for an aircraft that can operate closely with the U.S. military gives the U.S. companies an edge.A final decision is not likely to be reached until 2018, with deployment due at the end of the 2020s at the earliest.

Outgoing Air Force chief of staff hints at Lockheed F-22 restart
Although U.S. Air Force and industry officials have repeatedly dismissed the chances of reviving production of Lockheed Martin’s (LMT -0.6%) F-22 fighter aircraft, the Air Force’s outgoing chief of staff says it might not be such a crazy idea after all, Defense News reports.Gen. Mark Welsh said yesterday that "the success of the F-22 and the capability of the airplane and the crews that fly it are pretty exceptional. I think it’s proven that the airplane is exactly what everybody hoped it would be... Well, could you build more? It’s not a crazy idea.”Welsh said the Air Force is working with LMT to determine the feasibility and cost of such a project.D.C. lawmakers have condemned the decision to shut down the F-22 line ever since LMT terminated production nearly five years ago.

Russian rocket engine dispute may jeopardize some civil space programs
Escalating congressional battles over the use of Russian rocket engines to launch the military’s workhorse Atlas V rockets are shaking the Boeing-Lockheed (BA, LMT) United Launch Alliance joint venture, and may threaten the financial viability of certain U.S. civil space programs, WSJ reports, citing aerospace industry officials.If access to the Russian-built technology is cut off for Pentagon missions, then the annual number of Atlas V launches would drop sharply, which in turn would raise the price of remaining NASA missions because overhead costs would have to be spread across fewer launches and possibly adding hundreds of millions of dollars to NASA’s launch costs in future years.WSJ says the issue was raised in a recent conference between the head of NASA and senior officials of Boeing, one of two contractors developing commercial capsules to shuttle astronauts to and from the international space station; Boeing’s Starliner vehicle, scheduled to make its first manned flight in early 2018, is intended to ride on top of an Atlas V.

Lockheed Martin downgraded at Stifel on valuation, free cash flow concerns

Aerojet has plenty of upside - Barron's
Shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD) closed at $16.53 on Friday, down from $22.77 last September. The drop was propelled by the disclosure that United Launch Alliance (a JV of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) that conducts the U.S. government's main launch service for deep-space missions) was moving its $100M/year business to AJRD competitor Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA).Barron's is bullish on the stock, noting the following:Aerojet has until 2019 to make up the loss (6% of its revenue); to wit, revenue grew 7% in the past year.Shares are cheap: 6x Ebitda vs. 10x for its peers, according to large hedge-fund owner Jeremy Briendel of Royal Capital Management. He notes management's poor investor-expectation-management skills, and says the current price offers newcomers the chance to pick up an "elite collection of
assets at historic low valuations."Breindel has a $35/share valuation for Aerojet: With revenue of $1B last year, its defense unit generates cash flow of $132M. Defense companies generally trade at a multiple of 12x cash flow, so that alone gives Aerojet a valuation of $21/share. Until the contract with ULA ends in 2019, all of Aerojet's current work for the launch partnership generates about $46M in annual cash flow. Applying a 10x multiple to that figure adds about $6 a share. The rest of Aerojet's space business kicks in $62M n annual cash flow, or $8/share. He estimates its real estate at $4 a share, and $3/share in cash, for a total of $42, which will drop by a few dollars once the ULA contract ends. Deducting $553M in debt means ($7/share) brings us back to $35, or implied upside of more than 100%.Now read Aerojet Rocketdyne's Restatements No Cause For Concern » Apr. 17, 2016, 8:46 AM | 6 Comments

United Technologies' (UTX -0.2%) performance building engines for the F-35 fighter have been plagued by “recurring manufacturing quality issues,” Bloomberg reports, citing the Defense Department’s annual report on the program.The DoD says quality deficiencies in turbine blades and electronic control systems forced "suspect hardware" to be removed from the operational fleet, but UTX unit Pratt & Whitney “has taken action to improve quality surveillance within their manufacturing processes," and the DoD has worked to ensure improvements are in place as production accelerates.UTX is under pressure to hone its quality processes as the Pentagon plans to spend nearly $49B buying as many as 2,457 engines for the fighters built by Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.5%).Now read United Technologies: No longer a bargain Mar. 31, 2016, 2:27 PM | 15 Comments

Reduced Pentagon F-35 orders should not affect cost cuts, Lockheed exec says
The U.S. Defense Department's plan to defer some orders for F-35 fighter jets over the next five years should not have a significant impact on efforts to lower the jet's costs, according to the Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) exec in charge of the $391B program.LMT's Jeff Babione told the Air Force Association's annual Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando today that the company and its suppliers are continuing broad-based efforts to lower the cost of the new radar-evading warplane, and that given growing international orders, the small number of jets to be deferred by the Pentagon was "not significant."The Pentagon's manager for the F-35 program said earlier this month that agreements on the next two batches of the jets, worth a combined $15B, should be finalized in March, although Babione says a deal is taking longer than expected largely due to the sheer size and complexity of the program.

The Pentagon's chief arms thinks its "questionable" whether ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.4%) and Boeing (BA -9.2%), could survive if the Department of Defense immediately stopped using Russian RD-180 engines that power its Atlas 5 rocket.Undersecretary Frank Kendall told a hearing that ULA did have a second rocket, the Delta 4, that did not use the RD-180, but that vehicle was far more costly than the Atlas 5 and could not compete with launches provided by SpaceX.The DoD is concerned about losing ULA as a competitor since that would leave the military relying only on privately held SpaceX for launches, despite a policy that requires two ways to launch satellites into space.Previously: Boeing-Lockheed JV drops out of Air Force rocket contest (Nov. 16 2015)Previously: SpaceX bashes ULA bid for Russian engine waiver (Oct. 09 2015)Previously: WSJ: Boeing, Lockheed differ on whether to sell rocket joint venture (Sep. 10 2015) Jan. 27, 2016, 10:54 AM | 6 Comments

Raytheon (RTN +0.9%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT +1.2%) are the key beneficiaries of a $1.83B U.S. arms sale to Taiwan -- the first major arms sale to Taiwan in more than four years, but one that has earned the companies the threat of sanctions from China.China protested the sale, though the U.S. reiterated that it's staying consistent with its approach across six administrations to ensure Taipei can mount a credible defense. China considers Taiwan a rogue province."To safeguard our national interests, China has decided to take necessary measures, including imposing sanctions against the companies involved in the arms sale," said China's Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang.The deal includes $57M of Javelin missiles made by the two companies; $268M in TOW anti-tank missiles and $217M in Stinger missiles made by Raytheon; and $375M of AAV-7 Amphibious Assault Vehicles, along with a pair of guided-missile frigates offered as surplus, and $416M in other items including guns and ammo.Back to possible sanctions: Lockheed has an existing agreement to build an offshore plant to provide energy for a luxury resort in southern China.

Orbital ISS supply launch scrubbed by weather
Bad weather scrubbed a launch by Orbital ATK (OA -2.5%), in what would be a resumption of cargo runs to the International Space Station slightly more than a year after an Antares rocket exploded just after liftoff.The company had to skip a launch window at 5:55 p.m. today, and reset for an opportunity at 5:33 p.m. Friday.The launch planned to take an Orbital Cygnus craft on top of an Atlas 5 rocket, carrying 7,700 pounds of food, clothing, supplies and experiments (including a modular satellite kit and a pair of Microsoft HoloLens headsets).Orbital had elected to go with the Atlas rockets, made by United Launch Alliance (BA, LMT), after the failure of a refurbished Soviet-era motor sold by Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD) for the Antares.Orbital is competing against SpaceX and Sierra Nevada for follow-on cargo delivery contracts expected to be awarded next month.Previously: Boeing dropped from NASA's space station cargo flight competition (Nov. 05 2015)Previously: In setback for Aerojet Rocketdyne, ULA picks Orbital ATK motors (Sep. 22 2015) Dec. 3, 2015, 6:53 PM | 4 Comments

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will delay a final decision on the fate of its government IT business until early next year, CFO Bruce Tanner says.A decision on a sale or spinoff had been expected by the end of the year, but Tanner says the high level of interest from potential buyers had stretched out a process now likely to be concluded in Q1 2016.LMT has been the largest supplier of IT services to the U.S. government for 20 years but began reviewing the business last year because of stiff competition and sluggish growth prospects.Analysts have valued LMT's IT business at ~$4B.

Boeing/Lockheed launch venture joining micro-satellite market
United Launch Alliance -- the joint venture of Boeing (BA +0.7%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.4%) -- is jumping into a big market for small hardware by planning mini-satellite launches.The smaller satellites, known as CubeSats, are 110 pounds or smaller and their units drop down to about 4-inch cubes of three pounds, which can be assembled to form larger craft. The JV plans to start flying a specially made carrier with berths for 24 craft on Atlas 5 rockets by mid-2017.Some 92 of the CubeSats were launched in 2013; SpaceWorks Enterprises estimates that 410-543 of them will need launches in 2020. Companies including Google's SkyBox Imaging are developing networks of the tiny satellites.ULA says it will charge about $100K to launch one unit. Nov. 19, 2015, 4:20 PM | 1 Comment
$100B boost in defense spending could be on the way
The NATO treaty calls for its 28 signatories to have a common goal of defense spending equal to 2% of GDP, says David Rosenberg. Not all do, with France (at 1.8%), Germany (1.2%), Italy (1%), and Canada (1%) notably falling short.Following the terrorist attacks, it's no surprise there will likely be renewed commitments to hitting that target. What would it mean in terms of dollars? More than $100B in renewed defense spending from the NATO countries alone, says Rosenberg.For the week, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is up 5.1%, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) 7.4%, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) 5.1%, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) 3.4%.

Northrop Grumman has capacity for more big contracts, CEO Bush says
Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) has the capacity to bid on other major upcoming Pentagon contract awards even after securing its huge deal to build a fleet of new bombers, CEO Wes Bush said in today's earnings conference call."We have the resources in place [and] we are ready to get to work," Bush said on the deal to build as many as 100 long-range bombers but declined to comment further, citing its classified nature.The CEO also said the company does not plan to follow some rivals and carve out its services business, as the recent restructuring aims at speeding product development and reducing costs rather than repositioning its portfolio.Analysts estimate the bomber award could add $1B or more to NOC's annual revenue - which reached $24B last year - if it successfully navigates an expected protest from losing companies Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).Credit Suisse’s Robert Spingarn calculates ~5.4% upside for NOC, and that the win was a pleasant surprise for shareholders, as the Boeing-Lockheed team was the favorite.

Incoming Canada government to restart fighter jet competition
Fresh off its political victory, Canada's incoming Liberal government will totally restart a competition for fighter jets, as incoming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had suggested.The country is looking to replace its aging CF-18 aircraft, and the outgoing Conservatives had proposed buying Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth fighters. But a Liberal source says the party will put out a new request for proposals with a new set of requirements for the craft when it takes power Nov. 4.The competition will be fresh, the source suggested, rather than simply going with another choice like Boeing's (NYSE:BA) F/A-18E/F jets. Those jets are expected to end production by 2019 if not earlier, and Canada's reset could mean that choosing the CF-18's replacement could take years.Other contenders: Dassault Aviation (OTC:DUAVF), Saab (OTC:SAABF), and a combination of BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY), Finmeccanica (OTCPK:FINMY) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY).Lockheed is down 0.7% after hours; Boeing is up 0.2%.Previously: F-35 jet cost to rise if Canada skips orders (Oct. 22 2015)Previously: Trudeau's election threatens Canada's F-35 program (Oct. 21 2015) Oct. 26, 2015, 7:08 PM | 13 Comments

Lockheed Martin says $11.25B Saudi ship deal could close next year
Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.6%) could seal an $11.25B deal to sell naval ships to Saudi Arabia as early as next year, CEO Marillyn Hewson said on today's earnings conference call.Saudi Arabia wants to buy four vessels based on LMT's high-speed littoral combat ship, while the Pentagon has curtailed orders for its version of the ship; the proposed Saudi deal would be one of the largest-ever overseas defense orders, and would ease concerns that export opportunities are being hurt by the strong dollar and collapsing commodity prices, which have cut the spending power of big military customers overseas.Hewson says LMT had an international backlog of $20B in 2014 and remains on track to raise international sales to 25% of overall revenues in coming years, citing strong demand for company products such as its F-35 and F-16 fighter jets, C-130J transport plane, and missile defense equipment.The CEO says LMT expects to finalize the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft (UTX +4.1%) by the end of the year, with the sole remaining review in China likely to conclude without any difficulty.

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has launched a review aimed at cutting corporate overhead costs by as much as 30%, one of several possible reductions considered on top of its announced plan to sell or spin off various services businesses, Reuters reports.U.S. arms makers have been streamlining operations in recent years to cut costs due to the downturn in U.S. military spending; Jefferies defense analyst Howard Rubel says LMT also faces pressure from the Pentagon to offer price concessions in some major contracts it is negotiating - a five-year contract for up to 83 C-130J transport planes, and two separate deals for ~160 F-35 fighter jets.Earlier: Lockheed to cut 250 jobs in missile, fire control business (Oct. 15) Oct. 16, 2015, 5:42 PM | 43 Comments

Bloomberg: Lockheed can expect contest for GPS satellites
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) likely will face competition from the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) for billions of dollars in contracts to build as many as 22 improved GPS satellites, Bloomberg reports, quoting a top U.S. Air Force procurement official.The Pentagon approved an Air Force proposal for competition in part because LMT fell behind in completing the first of as many as eight of the GPS III satellites under a contract it won in 2008.LMT is 28 months late in delivering the first satellite because of flaws in the satellite’s navigation payload system, produced by a subcontractor, that the company and the military say are now corrected.

Lockheed delivered just 3 of 44 missile defense interceptors, agency says
Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.4%) delivered only three of 44 interceptors for the THAAD missile defense system in FY 2015 due to a seven-month halt in production caused by computer issues, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.The interceptors for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense program, which has an average budget of $800M/year, are now expected to be delivered by September 2016.Such glitches often result in lower award or incentive fees for contractors, but the agency does not comment on whether LMT's fees would be reduced.

SpaceX bashes ULA bid for Russian engine waiver
SpaceX is slamming a bid by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), to get a waiver from a U.S. ban on Russian rocket engines.Founder Elon Musk has told Defense Secretary Ash Carter that federal law already allowed ULA to use "a substantial number" of engines and its bid (see next bullet) was "nothing less than deceptive brinkmanship for the sole purpose of thwarting the will of Congress."ULA CEO Tory Bruno told reporters last week that without some relief from the ban, the company would be unable to bid in the GPS satellite competition, or for any other new national security launches until 2019.The Defense Department expects to decide "fairly soon" whether to issue the waiver.

DoD chief weapons buyer says he likely will allow bomber contract
The top weapons buyer for the U.S. Department of Defense says he probably will soon give the Air Force permission to award the contract for the next U.S. long-range bomber because extensive preparations have indicated "we have viable bids."The Air Force can proceed only after Frank Kendall, undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, convenes a Defense Acquisition Board review to assess the readiness to award a contract in the competition that pits Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) against a team of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).The Long-Range Strike Bomber may cost more $800M a piece in today’s dollars when development costs are included, and a fleet of 100 is planned; the bomber, scheduled for first deployment in the mid-2020s, will be one of the Pentagon’s biggest weapons systems over the next decade.

Reuters: Lockheed considering merging IT services with peer in major deal
Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.9%) is looking at merging some of its IT and services businesses ($4B worth) with those of another contractor -- CACI International (CACI +1.4%) and SAIC (SAIC +1%) are in talks -- to create the country's largest government services contractor, Reuters reports.The deal could bring a $2B windfall for Lockheed, which has an eye to paying down some debt after a $9B cash deal to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft.Companies that also include Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH +0.3%) and Leidos Holdings (LDOS +1.7%) are reportedly talking with Lockheed about a Reverse Morris Trust deal for its assets -- a manner of using a subsidiary for a transitional merger in order to unload assets without paying taxes on their gains, effectively a tax-free transfer to an external company.The programs that could be spun off are chiefly in information systems and government services but include some in missiles and fire control. It's all part of a strategic review Lockheed kicked off in July along with the Sikorsky deal. Oct. 2, 2015, 6:55 PM | 6 Comments
WSJ: Lockheed Martin eliminated from NASA’s space cargo competition
Lockheed Martin (LMT -1.4%) has been eliminated from NASA's pending multibillion-dollar competition to ship cargo to the international space station starting in about three years, WSJ reports.The decision would poses a potentially significant setback to LMT’s plans to accelerate development of enhanced space exploration capabilities; LMT had hoped a NASA contract would provide technical steppingstones - as well as a financial boost - for preliminary work on robotic vehicles, reusable space tugs and in-orbit refueling capabilities that ultimately would be needed for missions deep into the solar system.NASA is said to have made its decision during this past summer, largely on the basis of price.

DoD warns against mergers following Lockheed-Sikorsky deal
The U.S. Defense Department does not support large-scale acquisitions that could winnow its prime contractors following Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE:LMT) $9B purchase of Sikorsky (NYSE:UTX), according to comments from DoD Sec. Carter and undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics Frank Kendall.Warning that with “size comes power,” Kendall says the Pentagon will work with the Justice Department and Congress to preserve a diverse industrial base.The statements come ahead of the contract award for a new long-range bomber, which some analysts say could prompt a tie-up of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC).U.S. defense stocks extended gains after the remarks, led by a 2.4% rally for Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).LMT says it disagrees with the comments, saying there is no evidence to support the view that larger defense companies reduce competition or inhibit innovation.

Lockheed-Boeing launch venture wins $882M DoD contract
United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), wins an $882M contract to continue launching satellites for the U.S. Air Force with its Delta IV and Atlas V rockets.The U.S. Defense Department says the contract covers launch capability, mission integration, base and range support, maintenance, depreciation on equipment, mission assurance, program management, systems engineering, and launch site and range operations during FY 2016, which begins Oct. 1.

Big weapons programs face disruption if Congress caps funding
Some of the biggest U.S. weapons programs could be disrupted by a stopgap budget measure that caps federal funding at prior-year levels and prevents the launch of new programs and multiyear deals, as time is running out for lawmakers to reach an agreement on next year’s spending before the current federal budget expires on Sept. 30.The U.S. Air Force estimates it stands to lose $13B in additional funding from such a stopgap, affecting ~60 programs including the award of a bomber deal for which a team of Boeing (BA +0.1%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.3%) is vying with Northrop Grumman (NOC +0.1%).The Air Force wants to protect the Boeing deal, which leaves the company responsible for any costs exceeding $4.9B; Boeing has taken $1.3B in charges because of problems with the KC-46A refueling tanker, which flew for the first time on Sept. 25, and the Air Force wants to avoid a new deal that could expose it to paying for any further glitches.A stopgap also could cap next year’s spending on LMT's F-35, the Pentagon’s largest program, at $8.6B vs. the requested $11B, which would cut 19 jets from next year’s planned order and disrupt efforts to cut the jet’s cost by raising annual production to 120 planes over the next three years; the F-35’s suppliers include United Technologies (UTX +0.7%) Pratt & Whitney unit, which makes the engine.

Reuters: Aerojet weighs higher offer for Lockheed-Boeing venture
Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD -1.5%) is considering raising its $2B offer for United Launch Alliance, a rocket launch venture of Boeing (BA +0.4%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.3%), but faces big hurdles after a rejection of the bid last week, Reuters reports.AJRD faces an uphill climb given growing tensions between the two companies over the past few years, according to the report; earlier this week, ULA dumped AJRD as its solid rocket motor supplier and signed a long-term deal with its rival Orbital ATK (OA -0.5%).An AJRD takeover of ULA also would require Russia to give its regulatory approval and transfer a technology license for use of the Russian RD-180 engine that powers ULA's Atlas V rocket, the report says.Analysts have questioned how AJRD could raise the money for the deal, and even whether is worth $2B given the changing space market.

In setback for Aerojet Rocketdyne, ULA picks Orbital ATK motors
United Launch Alliance -- the joint rocket venture of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) -- has chosen Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA) to provide solid rocket motors for the Atlas V and Vulcan vehicles, in a "long-term strategic partnership" starting in 2019.That's a setback for Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD), who's supplying those motors for the Atlas rocket currently."We remain committed to our solid rocket business which provides very competitive and reliable products to the marketplace," says Aerojet's Glenn Mahone, who added the company would keep supplying to ULA until 2019 and pursue an Air Force ICBM contract as well as commercial orders.If Aerojet loses more orders, it would need to re-evaluate the large Sacramento facility where it builds the motors.Boeing this week also rejected Aerojet's $2B bid for ULA.

Short term moves to revise downward the Air Force's planned purchase of 1,763 Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth fighters could damage the program and scare off foreign buyers, the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff has warned."All we do right now is risk damaging a program that's now gaining some momentum and is about to become operational," said General Mark Welsh.Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, who takes over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff this month, and Admiral John Richardson, who takes over as chief of naval operations on Friday, have both sparked questions about possible changes to the U.S. military's F-35 fleet plans.

Northrop Grumman up 1.5% after logging new contracts
Northrop Grumman (NOC +1.5%) said early today that its Sperry Marine unit was selected to supply Integrated Bridge Systems to future frigates serving in the Royal Thai Navy.Meanwhile, the company's also gotten a revised B-2 maintenance contract from the Air Force that will help the service save $900M in costs over the fleet's life and make another jet available for combat at any time. It also cuts average maintenance time to 364 days from 400 days.And upgrades to Northrop's unmanned Global Hawk surveillance aircraft might cost only half the previous estimate of $4B, an Air Force official says -- a key issue as the Air Force can't budget for two different spyplane platforms.Upgrades to the Global Hawk of a new electro-optical sensor and a camera with wider field of view are necessary before the Air Force retires an aging fleet of U-2 spy planes made by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) -- which itself would like to upgrade the U-2 to keep it operating.Northrop shares are up 15.6% YTD.

Lockheed Martin providing cruise missiles to Poland in $500M deal
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has won the contract to provide the JASSM -- Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile -- to Poland for use on its F-16 fleet, Lockheed's third international customer for the missiles.The Pentagon asked Congress to approve the $500M foreign military sale last fall. Lockheed's providing hardware, software, docs and program management along with 40 missiles. More than 1,700 of the precision-guided cruise missiles have been delivered; the U.S. Air Force deploys it on the B-1, B-2, B-52, F-16 and F-15E, and internationally it's on F/A-18s.Lockheed can look at it as an opportunity to expand the JASSM's longer-range variation to other international customers. The extended range weapon has a more fuel-efficient design, but with an identical size, can fit on the same platforms as the standard weapon. Sep. 14, 2015, 3:58 PM | 1 Comment
WSJ: Boeing, Lockheed differ on whether to sell rocket joint venture
A reported $2B bid for the U.S. military’s primary rocket maker is running into complications, as Boeing (NYSE:BA) is less inclined to sell its 50% stake than JV partner Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), according to WSJ.Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings' (NYSE:AJRD) bid for United Launch Alliance reportedly is favored by LMT, which is more interested in a sale as part of a broader, company-wide portfolio restructuring, while Boeing’s leadership seems to prefer hanging on to its stake.Boeing said today that it remains "committed to [United Launch] and its business,” which it called "the most reliable and effective way to ensure access to space for a wide range of government customers."At the same time, United Launch made a surprising step closer to selecting a new engine for the Vulcan family of rocket boosters from space startup Blue Origin, run by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, signing a deal “to expand production capabilities” for the BE-4 engine; AJRD proposed a competing main engine months ago.

Army set to award multibillion-dollar contract for Humvee replacement
A years-long process to replace the Army's Humvee with a new armored truck will likely take a multibillion-dollar step today as a Pentagon board meets to award an initial contract.A deal announced today for 17,000 of a total 55,000 vehicles would be valued at up to $9B initially, and worth up to $30B eventually.Of the three companies who won development contracts three years ago, Oshkosh (OSK +2.7%) is considered a front-runner by insiders, based on its experience building specialty ATVs for troops in Afghanistan.But the Humvee's originator, private AM General, and Lockheed Martin (LMT +2.3%) -- in a team with BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY +1.5%) -- are still in the mix. Lockheed's new to the ground vehicle business and has built a new facility in Arkansas for production.With the increasing prevalance of roadside bombs, the new JLTV (Joint Light Tactical Vehicle) program is a top priority for the military.

Sikorsky deal looks like a win-win for Lockheed, United Technologies
Lockheed Martin (LMT +1.9%) hit a "trifecta" today following the announcement of its $9B purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies (UTX -0.7%), according to the analyst team at UBS.The deal cements LMT's dominance in weapons making and opens key foreign markets for the company, which has annual revenues of $45B; analysts do not expect antitrust objections since LMT does not build helicopters.LMT also announced a strategic review of a large portion of its government IT and services portfolio for a potential sale or spinoff.Also, LMT's Q2 results came in well ahead of consensus, with 3% revenue growth well ahead of the UBS forecast for a 6% decline and 12% margins coming in 30 bps better than expected.UTX shares also are worth buying, according to Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment, who says the Sikorsky sale is a "positive first step" in the transformation of its business portfolio and allows the company to return a large amount of cash to shareholders without reducing balance sheet flexibility; while Sikorsky generated ~10% of UTX sales, it only accounted for 6.5% of its profits.

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has agreed to buy United Technologies' (NYSE:UTX) Sikorsky Aircraft for over $8B, Reuters reports, cementing a deal that would give the Black Hawk helicopter to the maker of the F-35 fighter jet.The acquisition of Sikorsky, which had more than 15K employees and net sales of $7.5B at the end of last year, would be the biggest by Lockheed since its $10B takeover of Martin Marietta two decades ago.Pentagon officials said last week they would carefully evaluate any sale to maintain competition and avoid market distortions.

First flight of new Sikorsky helicopter pushed back again
United Technologies' (UTX -0.5%) Sikorsky Aircraft has been forced to delay the first flight of its largest helicopter until later this year while it completes testing fixes to its gearbox and other problems, the U.S. Navy said yesterday.Navy program officials say they have resolved gearbox problems that have contributed to delays in the new CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter that was due to fly for the first time in June 2014, but additional testing is still required.The Marine Corps plans to buy 200 of the helicopters, a $25B program that accounts for half of Sikorsky’s existing commitments from the Pentagon; military helicopters generate ~70% of Sikorsky’s revenue, and the King Stallion contract is a key attraction for prospective buyers such as Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.2%) and Textron (TXT -1.2%).

Boeing, aerospace segment "has legs," J.P. Morgan analyst says
The commercial aerospace segment still provides opportunities for double-digit gains over the next 18 months, as the "aero cycle has legs," J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman says, initiating coverage of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and several peers with Overweight ratings.Boeing’s cash flow outlook has been controversial, but Seifman views 787 unit cost reduction as a powerful driver that can push free cash flow to $9.1B in 2017, 44% above 2015 estimates with potential for growth beyond; Seifman sees the precedent Boeing set by returning $8B of cash last year as a signal of confidence in future cash flow.General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) balance sheet might drive upside, while Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) could use its financial strength to create value, but Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is started at Underweight, as the analyst sees "fewer arrows left in the quiver" and expectations may be too high following recent outperformance in its shares.Initiated at Overweight along with Boeing: GD, LMT, SPR, TDG.Started at Neutral: BEAV, COL, PCP, TGI, TXT, HRS, LLL Earlier: JPMorgan initiates coverage on several aerospace plays Jul. 14, 2015, 7:40 PM | 7 Comments

United Technologies' F-35 engines called unreliable by government auditor
F-35 engines from United Technologies (UTX -0.3%) are proving so unreliable that U.S. plans to increase production of the fighter jet may be slowed, congressional auditors say.Data from flight tests evaluated by the GAO show the reliability of engines from UTX’s Pratt & Whitney unit is "very poor (less than half of what it should be) and has limited” progress for the F-35, the agency said in a report sent to lawmakers this month.According to GAO officials, engines on the Marine Corps’ complex version of the F-35, designed for short takeoffs and vertical landings, flew ~47 hours between failures caused by engine design issues instead of the 90 hours planned for this point, while Air Force and Navy model engines flew ~25 hours between failures instead of the 120 hours planned.Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, says the company was surprised by the report's unusually stern language but that "the engine is reliable."The U.S. military plans to spend $391B for a fleet of 2,443 planes from prime contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.8%).

Lockheed aims for cost cuts, reputation in satellite business, key exec says
Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.3%) has long dominated the U.S. military space market, but it is trying harder than ever to cut costs, become more innovative and shed a reputation for arrogance, Mark Valerio, the head of its military satellite unit tells Reuters.LMT interviewed 60 officials at the Pentagon, Air Force Space Command and the Air Force's Space and Missiles Systems Center late last year as part of a broader drive to improve its relationships with the U.S. government, the exec says.LMT is pushing to cut costs on existing programs by consolidating facilities, finding and testing new uses for additive manufacturing and standardizing parts across multiple satellites, Valerio says.One key test will be how LMT fares in an Air Force competition for the next batch of GPS satellites later this year after the current GPS III program was marred by delays.

U.S. permits armed drones sales to allies
As a step toward providing allied nations with weapons, the U.S. government has established a policy that will permit the widespread export of armed drones for the first time.Under the new rules, foreign governments' requests for drones will be examined on a case-by-case basis, while recipient nations must agree to certain "end-use assurances."To date, the U.S. has sold its armed drones only to Britain. Unarmed military drones, used primarily for intelligence, have been sold to several countries, including France and Italy.The shift in policy comes just days after the FAA proposed rules that would lift some restrictions on drones for commercial use.Related stocks: AVAV, NOC, TXT, LMT, LLL, RTN, BA, SAIC, GD, OA, COL, UTX Feb. 18, 2015, 8:58 AM | 6 Comments

Pratt & Whitney (NYSE:UTX) says it is close to signing a deal with the Pentagon, to supply more engines for the F-35 fighter jet program.The two-batch deal is expected to be worth more than $1B, but the company must first iron out issues centered around it's June engine fire, which grounded the F-35 fleet for weeks.Pratt President Bennett Croswell tells reporters that the company has already more than halved the cost of each F-35 engine, resulting in prices 7.5% to 8% cheaper than the firm's last batch.

Report: Canada to buy fighter jets from U.S. and not Europe
Canada is likely to choose between two U.S. firms when it buys a new fleet of fighters jets, says Reuters quoting a source.The source related that Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 and Boeing's (NYSE:BA) F-18 E/F Super Hornet were deemed more suitable for the tasks the military has laid out.If so, the choice would result in the widely expected elimination of Dassault Aviation's (OTC:DUAVF) Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon, jointly made by BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY), Finmeccanica (OTCPK:FINMY) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY).

Pentagon says F-35 engine fix will be minimal
Following an earlier report which stated Pratt & Whitney (UTX -0.1%) will begin testing a design change on the engine of Lockheed Martin's (LMT -0.1%) F-35, Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall has now announced that the cost of the fix will be minimal."I am getting, over time, more confident that we've got our arms around that problem and are solving it," says Kendall. "I don’t think it’s going to be a huge cost. I think it's a relatively minor cost." Sep. 3, 2014, 10:58 AM
Pratt & Whitney to begin F-35 engine testing this week
Pratt & Whitney (NYSE:UTX) will begin testing a design change this week to fix the issue which caused a massive engine failure aboard a Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) F-35 fighter jet in June.The failure caused the engine to break apart and catch fire, resulting in the grounding of the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks. Flights have recently resumed, although certain restrictions still apply.Following Friday's temporary suspension on delivery of engines due to questions over titanium origins, Pratt has now sued its titanium supplier A&P Alloys for fraud and breach of contract.

Lockheed Martin GPS satellites hit milestone
The U.S. Air Force's fleet of 20 GPS Block IIR and IIR-M satellites, manufactured by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), have reached 200 collective years of operational life.The milestone is even greater, as the satellite group was designed to last only 7.5 years, or collectively about 150 years. Three of the eight GPS IIR-M satellites have already surpassed their expected life span and all satellites will have done so in 2017.Lockheed Martin is already developing the next generation GPS III satellites, which will deliver three times better accuracy, provide up to eight times improved anti-jamming capabilities, and include enhancements which extend spacecraft life to 15 years.

Pratt & Whitney halted F-35 engine delivery over titanium origin
United Technologies' (NYSE:UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit says it suspended delivery of engines for the F-35 jet, the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program, over concern that a supplier may have provided “suspect” titanium.UTX says delivery was halted in May after an in-house inspection and testing process raised questions about the origin of the titanium; UTX replaced all suspect engine parts in its inventory for failing to meet specifications, but determined the titanium in 147 F-35 engines already delivered did not pose a flight safety risk.The Pratt & Whitney engine accounts for $68.4B of the $398.6B projected cost of the F-35 being built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).

Subsidy squabble hits Mitsubishi's F-35 deal with BAE
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' (OTCPK:MHVYF) involvement in the $400B F-35 project could be delayed as concerns have surfaced over the subsidies which back the program, Reuters reports.Arms industry bureaucrats who seek subsidies to back Japan's stake in the project are in a squabble with the finance ministry which wishes to curb spending due to Japan's massive budget deficit.Japan also wishes to participate in the F-35 project as a sign of the nation's willingness to end decades of isolation, after a four-decade-old ban on selling arms overseas was recently lifted.The worries could force Japan's biggest arms maker to renegotiate the deal with Britain's BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY) for supplying F-35 rear fuselage parts under an international consortium.BAE, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and other members of the nine-nation group welcome Japan's F-35 participation, but not if it means relenting on tight production costs.

U.S. to clear communication barriers over F-35 program
Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh says a memorandum is now being drafted that will allow information to be easily shared and determine which parties need to be involved in case of another Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) F-35 malfunction.The need for communication is a result of the F-35 engine fire incident in June that caused the jet to miss its first international debut at two U.K. air shows."The F-35 has now flown 8,700 sorties over 14,000 flight hours, and this is the first time we've had a major engine fire," says Welsh. "I'm confident that the program will remain on track and that we'll reach initial operational capability in December 2016. This fire's not going to affect that."The $400B F-35 program is the world's costliest weapons project. Jul. 31, 2014, 7:11 AM

Safety concerns nix air show appearance for F-35 jet fighter
The U.S. Defense Department says it will not send its advanced F-35 jet fighter to the U.K. for a long-awaited international debut because of lingering concerns about an engine fire that raised concerns about the safety of the next generation fighter jets.While the military cleared the F-35 for limited flights earlier today, the Pentagon says the restrictions made it impossible to fly the plane to the U.K. to take part in the Farnborough airshow now under way.The cancellation is a blow to the Pentagon's most expensive military program, as well as to Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), which makes the F-35, and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) unit Pratt Whitney, which makes the engines. Jul. 15, 2014, 6:30 PM
F-35 cleared for take-off
The no-fly ban on the Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 has been lifted, clearing the fighter jet for flight. The warplane was previously grounded after an engine caught fire in Florida last month.Pratt & Whitney (NYSE:UTX), the manufacturer of the engine, is breathing a sigh of relief as it now seems the engine malfunction is not a systematic defect.The news also boosts the chances of the F-35 making an appearance at the Farnborough Airshow this week. The expo is prime time for international exposure and missing the show could put a dent into sales. Jul. 15, 2014, 8:10 AM
Engine malfunction of F-35 likely not to affect entire fleet
The Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 remains grounded, and will most likely miss its other international air shows in the U.K next week, although the Pentagon states that the June malfunction causing an engine fire is likely not a systematic issue."We really want to get at the root cause of this to determine exactly what caused it," says Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall. "There's a growing body of evidence that this may have been an individual situation, not a systemic one. But we don't know that for certain at this point in time."The fighter jet's engine is manufactured by Pratt & Whitney (UTX). Jul. 11, 2014, 7:09 AM

Lockheed says 13% operating margins will be difficult to maintain
Lockheed Martin (LMT -1.7%) says its Q1 operating margin reached 13.4%, easily ahead of 12.1% in the year-ago quarter, but it would be hard to maintain that level in coming years.CFO Bruce Tanner told analysts in this morning's earnings call that the growing importance of the F-35 fighter jet program, which accounts for ~16% of LMT's overall revenues but generates narrower margins, meant it would be hard to keep operating margins above 13% in coming years.Tanner expects additional F-35 orders from Australia, South Korea, Israel and Singapore, but he did not expect those orders to close in 2014; the F-35 program likely would account for ~25% of LMT's overall revenue by 2018 or 2019, when it reaches full rate production.

Lockheed's F-35 fighter to make overseas airshow debut this summer
Lockheed Martin's (LMT +1.2%) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will make its overseas airshow debut this summer in the U.K. as part of efforts to boost foreign sales of the jet and offset near-term cuts in U.S. purchases.The head of the U.S. Air Force said last week that the Pentagon could trim its plan to buy almost 2,500 F-35s over the next 20 years.The U.K. has taken delivery of three test airplanes and is in discussions to place an order for 14 training and operational aircraft but hasn't defined the total number of jets it expects to purchase ahead of a major defense review due next year.

Pentagon warns of major cuts due to sequestration
The Pentagon would have to cut $40B of its planned spending on operations and maintenance from 2016-2019 if Congress doesn't stop automatic budget cuts that are due to take effect in 2016.In a report yesterday, the DOD also said the R&D budget would fall $18B to $337B.Companies that would be affected include Lockheed Martin (LMT) and its F-35 program, Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX), GD (GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII).

Korea confirms deal to buy F-35 jets; deal reported at $6.79B
As expected, South Korea has formally selected Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 jet for the country's F-X fighter acquisition program, with Reuters reporting that the government expects to pay 7.34T won ($6.79B) for 40 planes.South Korea plans to finalize the deal in Q3 and take the first delivery in 2018.South Korea's decision follows a report that the F-35 faces more delays due to software problems and that Italy could further scale back a program to purchase 90 F-35s. (PR)South Korea also confirmed that it intends to acquire four of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) Global Hawk unmanned aircraft. The drones will cost 880B won and deliveries are set to begin in 2018.

Bloomberg: F-35 faces yet more delays due to software issues
"Persistent software problems" in Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 jet have slowed testing, and could further delay the fighter plane and raise costs, Bloomberg reports, citing a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).The Marines want the F-35 to be ready for warfare in mid-2015, but some of the testing could be up to 13 months late. "Delays of this magnitude would mean that the Marine Corps will not likely have all of the capabilities it expects in July 2015," the GAO says. That would put "put the timely delivery of Air Force and Navy initial operating capabilities at risk." Mar. 23, 2014, 5:03 AM | 33 Comments
Lockheed buys German commercial airport services firm
Lockheed Martin (LMT +0.4%) agrees to acquire BEONTRA, a small German company that provides forecasting services for some of the world's biggest commercial airports, including London Heathrow, Dubai, Sydney, Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Munich.Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and LMT says they were not material to the company, but analysts say the acquisition is noteworthy because it shows the company's determination to expand in non-defense markets as U.S. military spending declines.LMT said last week it was acquiring Industrial Defender, a privately held company that provides cyber security solutions for control systems in the oil and gas, utility and chemical industries.

Italian PM moves to cut taxes, revamp labor market
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has proposed cutting taxes by up to €10B and to reform the labor market as part of an attempt to revive his country's moribund economy and reduce unemployment of a record 12.9%.The government will reportedly pay for the tax reductions by lowering spending, including by cutting the number of Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 jets that the armed forces will buy.Meanwhile, the lower house of parliament is set to pass an electoral reform bill designed to make Italy more governable, including by increasing voting thresholds.The FTSE MIB is -0.2%.ETFs: EWI, ITLY, ITLT Mar. 12, 2014, 4:14 AM

Reuters: U.S. to buy fewer F-35 jets than planned
The Pentagon is set to significantly cut the number of Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter jets that it plans to order for the five years starting in 2015, Reuters reports.Because of budget cuts, the Navy will book 36 jets instead of 69, while the Air Force will defer orders for four planes but resume its planned bookings for 2016 and beyond. The USAF intends to buy 238 F-35s in total.The Marine Corps still plans to order 69 jets.Overall, the Pentagon intends to acquire 343 F-35s through fiscal 2019.Foreign orders are also set to fall short of initial plans, with bookings projected at 57 for jets funded in FY 2015 rather than 73.

Defense stocks higher even as big military budget cuts proposed
The Pentagon announces plans to shrink the U.S. Army to pre-WW II levels - to fewer than 450K from the current 520K - in order to meet 2015 spending caps.Also planned for elimination is the Air Force's fleet of A-10 Warthog close air support planes - a change some influential lawmakers are expected to oppose - to ensure continued funding of Lockheed Martin's (LMT +1.7%) new long-range F-35 bomber and a new aerial refueling tanker.Nevertheless, top defense stocks are solidly higher, presumably because the Defense Department envisions warfare being waged using enhanced technologies: BA +1.4%, GD +1.5%, NOC +1.9%, RTN +2.2%, HII +0.9%.

Ocean Power +41% on Lockheed deal to produce energy from ocean waves
Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT +40.9%) soars on news of a $205M deal with Lockheed Martin (LMT +2%) to produce the world’s largest wave energy project off the coast of Victoria, Australia.Once completed in 2018 or 2019, the project will generate 62.5 MW of peak power, about one-third the capacity of a small coal-fired power plant in the U.S. and enough to meet the needs of 10K homes, LMT says.The power buoys to be used in the project will rise ~30 ft. out of the water, far smaller than wind turbines which are typically 130 ft. tall and have drawn public resistance.The agreement is part of a drive by defense giant LMT to expand its foothold in alternative energy as it seeks to offset a slump in U.S. and European military budgets.

U.K. set to order 14 F-35 jets; LMT to focus on foreign sales
The U.K. could announce an order for 14 Lockheed Martin (LMT -1.4%) F-35 fighter jets next week, Reuters reports.The booking, which would be for the vertical-takeoff F-35B variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, would be Britain's first firm order for the plane since it committed to purchase 48 aircraft in 2012. The country has so far received three training jets.The deal ties in nicely with Lockheed's focus, as expressed by CFO Bruce Tanner today following the company's Q4 report, to grow its foreign business. Bookings from abroad accounted for 23% of orders and 17% of revenues last year, In 2014, Lockheed expects sales to increase a "little under 20%."Back in the U.S., Tanner hopes that 2014 will mark a "bottoming out" of military spending, especially following recent budget agreements that eased the effect of automatic cuts. The sequestration hurt Lockheed's earnings last year.Banner also says that Lockheed's forecast for an EPS increase in 2014 is linked to an improvement in the impact of the firm's pension obligations, due to a higher discount rate and lower liabilities.

South Korea to acquire 40 F-35 combat jets
South Korea intends to buy 40 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter planes after the government opted for more expensive aircraft but with greater stealth capabilities as it looks to defend the country against North Korea's nuclear threat.South Korea is due to sign the 8.3T won ($7.8B) deal in 2014 and take delivery of the planes in 2018. The country may also order another 20 jets.While the choice of the F-35 is not unexpected, it's a disappointment for Boeing (BA) and EADS (EADSF), which had hoped the government would split the deal and order planes from at least two manufacturers.

Boeing, EADS hope for split program as Lockheed zeros in on South Korean jet deal
Boeing (BA) and EADS (EADSF) are keeping their fingers crossed for a mixed purchase option in a $7.8B auction for South Korean fighter jets.In what is now a long-running saga, BA turned in an under-budget bid in September for F-15s, but concerns over the planes' capabilities ultimately compelled South Korea to restart the auction process.It now appears Lockheed Martin (LMT) is the favorite to win the auction, although the F-35's cost may still mean a split purchase is on the table.A mixed purchase would give BA and EADS some hope of participating in the deal with the advanced F-15 or Eurofighter programs, respectively.The terms of the auction will be settled before a November 27 Joint Chiefs of staff meeting, Reuters says, citing sources.

Lockheed Martin says F-35 right choice for South Korea: FT
Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.3%) isn't ready to "declare victory" its war against F-35 costs, but the program's VP Stephen O'Bryan reminds FT that "from the first year of production to the seventh year, [LMT has] reduced the price of the aircraft by more than 55%."FT also says the company is "confident of winning" the sought-after $8B tender offer for South Korean jet fighters.Some counted the F-35 out when Boeing's (BA -0.7%) F-15 bid was the only proposal that came in under-budget. Things changed when South Korea reopened the bidding process after former air force officials voiced concerns about the Silent Eagle's capabilities.Here's LMT on this issue: "The F-35 meets the requirements of Korea.

South Korea nearing decision to buy F-35 jets
South Korea is reportedly close to deciding that it will purchase Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 fighter jets, although the country could also order a smaller number of Boeing (BA) F-15 planes.The government could announce its plans in November as it looks to put the necessary funding in place. Those plans could include cutting the size of the order to 40-50 planes from 60.Last month, Seoul rejected a tender from Boeing for its F-15 Silent Eagle model due to concerns about the aircraft's technological capability, especially compared with the F-35, which was also in the running. The rejection came even though Boeing's proposal was the only one of three that came in under the government's budget of 8.3T won ($7.2B). Oct. 24, 2013, 7:35 AM | 2 Comments

Pentagon to withhold payments to Pratt & Whitney
Five percent of all billings to United Technologies' (UTX -0.7%) Pratt & Whitney unit will be held back until the company fixes flaws in a system used to track cost and schedule performance, according to a Defense Department spokesman. The 5% is the maximum that can be held back over such issues."We have submitted corrective action plans," says Pratt & Whitney, "and are working closely" with the Pentagon's Contract Management Agency.Through August, the Pentagon has withheld $195M in payments to the F-35's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.5%), over flaws in its contract management systems, but Lockheed was recently informed the amount held back has been reduced to 2% of billings from 5%.

Sterne, Agee previews defense earnings
Those defense contractors with heavy backlogs should fare best amid the government shutdown and 2014 sequester, says Sterne, Agee, which cuts estimates on KEYW Holding (KEYW -0.8%) due to its thin order book.Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.5%) - on the other hand - rates a hike in estimates thanks to its relatively large backlog. Look for budget scenarios and capital deployment plans to dominate the Q3 earnings call.The Q3 EPS estimate for General Dynamics (GD -1%) of $1.71 is $0.04 higher than consensus, with the team expecting management to reiterate its call for deploying 100% of free cash flow into buybacks and dividends.Raytheon (RTN -1.1%) estimates are about inline with consensus, supported by backlogs, international deliveries, and capital returns.Military backlogs have held up better than expected, says the team, which should held FLIR Systems (FLIR -0.8%) to a solid quarter.Harris (HRS -0.6%) won't get another big pickup in orders like it saw last year at this time, and Sterne's EPS estimate is $0.02 below the $1.13 consensus.Mercury Systems' (MRCY -2.2%) EPS is estimated to be a loss of $0.10, $0.02 lower than the Street - reflecting continued order delays in several key programs.

Airbus looks to head off airlifter re-exports
Airbus (EADSF.PK +1.8%) is working to help cash-strapped European buyers of its A400M airlifter as the prospect of re-export could delay the company's plans to build more of the troop planes and could also put on hold the reimbursement of a €3.5B bailout provided by customers after the cost of the plane exceeded its budget.
Airbus will repay the bailout money from export royalties, but that will only work if demand for exports isn't quenched by European customers reselling their planes to buyers around the world.This all comes at an interesting time for the industry as Boeing (BA -1.2%) has halted C-17 production and Lockheed Martin's (LMT -1.1%) C-130 Hercules faces unlikely competition from Embraer's (ERJ -1.9%) jet engine-powered KC-390.

Embraer challenges Lockheed's Hercules airlifter
"I don't think the Hercules has ever faced such serious competition - and it's the oldest aircraft in production," one aviation consultant tells Reuters, regarding Embraer's (ERJ -1.1%) KC-390, an unlikely challenger to Lockheed Martin's (LMT +0.3%) legendary airlifter.ERJ thinks the use of jet engines (rather than turboprops) will give the KC-390 a leg up on the competition. The ERJ executive in charge of the program says he is "certain" new jet engines can perform when landing on rough terrain.LMT respectfully disagrees: "If you go into [dirt or gravel] strips with a jet engine, that engine is liable to get destroyed."ERJ is looking for 15% of what it says is a $50B market over the next decade.

Former Korean air force chiefs prefer F-35 over F-15

Appeals court allows class-action status in lawsuit vs Lockheed
A federal appeals court has allowed class-action certification in a lawsuit that accuses Lockheed Martin (LMT) of the poor management of a "stable value fund" employee retirement plan.The decision overturns a lower-court ruling and means that 56,000 investors won't have to sue individually.The suit argues that, among other things, the fund produced poor returns due to an emphasis on money market funds rather than a better mix of short and intermediate-term investments."This decision means if imprudent management causes poor performance in the 401(k) plan, plan fiduciaries are on the hook for the full damages," says plaintiffs lawyer Jerome Schlichter.

JPMorgan lifts its price target ($70 from $68) on Northrop Grumman (NOC +3.6%) to reflect Thursday's announcement that the company plans to reduce the number of outstanding shares by 25% by 2015. More interesting is the color in the note regarding NOC's position relative to peers: the company "intends to return essentially all cash to shareholders. Besides LMT's nearly 50% payout ratio (which we believe is likely to rise still higher in September), this is the clearest multi-year strategic statement we have seen among large defense companies, and we think the market will reward this," notes analyst Joseph Nadol III.

Lockheed Martin's (LMT) CEO Marilyn Hewson "isn't surprised" that Australia is set to buy 100 F-35s and that Singapore and South Korea seem to be leaning toward purchasing the troubled jet. Hewson says that despite a history of delays and soaring costs, the F-35 (now the most expensive defense program in U.S. history) is winning over international support . "You can feel the momentum accelerating," Hewson notes. Even the jet's critics seem to be coming around: LMT's marketing campaign has been "highly effective and successful," said Winslow Wheeler, director of a Washington-based nonprofit that keeps tabs on government spending.

Beset with problems, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 fighter program is years behind schedule, while expenses run out of control. The price to build each plane is $137M vs $69M in 2001, and the program will cost $396B if the Pentagon keeps to a plan to build 2,443 jets by the late 2030s. That's not to mention the $1.1T in operating expenses. "It is simultaneously too big to fail and too big to succeed," says analyst Todd Harrison.

Lockheed Martin (LMT) and the Defense Department are close to an agreement on the "long-delayed" next order of F-35 fighter jets. The two sides have been at loggerheads over the $396B weapons program, the Pentagon's largest, since last December. LMT and its suppliers are already building the fifth batch of planes under a preliminary contract, and an agreement on the terms would free up additional funding for early work on a sixth set, which the company had been funding on its own for some time.

Nine years after Concorde flew for the final time, Gulfstream (GD), Boeing (BA) Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Nasa are among those working on developing a supersonic business jet. Given that manufacturers have done size and opulence, says one industry expert, time is the "only differentiator left." A big focus of research is muffling the sonic boom so that the plane can fly over populated areas. Nov. 27, 2012, 9:50 AM

Kendall wants more of a concentration on the "execution of the program and successful delivery of the product."

Tighter military budgets in the U.S. and Europe have reduced revenues for the top weapons makers by nearly 1% in H1, and are likely to continue to depress sales for the remainder of the year. The top 20 global aerospace and defense companies reported a $1.3B drop in revenues in the first half, following a 3.3% decline in 2011. The decline however, was offset by record-setting production of commercial aircraft, driving commercial revenues 14.9% higher and helping to increase overall revenues in the combined A&D sector by $7.2B, or 5.5%, over the same period.

Global defense sales fell 3.3% last year versus 2010 according to a study by Deloitte, driven by shifting government spending priorities, a weak global economy and the winding down of military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The decline masked a 2.3% overall increase in total global aerospace and defense revenues, largely driven by higher airline production rates. Going forward, the declining sales mean defense companies are going to continue to find it hard to maintain revenues, never mind grow this year.
