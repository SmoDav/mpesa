Lilly's Taltz beats J&J's Stelara in late-stage psoriasis study
Eli Lilly (LLY +0.5%) announces that a head-to-head Phase 3 clinical trial, IXORA-S, comparing Taltz (ixekizumab) to Janssen's (JNJ +0.2%) Stelara (ustekinumab) in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis showed Taltz's superiority. The results were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting in Orlando, FL.At week 24, the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement in symptoms was 91.2% for Taltz and 81.9% for Stelara. The proportions achieving at least a 90% improvement and a 100% improvement also favored Taltz: 82.1% vs. 59.0% and 49.3% vs. 23.5%, respectively.The FDA approved Taltz, a monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A, about a year ago for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Previously: FDA clears Lilly's ixekizumab for plaque psoriasis (March 22, 2016)

Big exporters form coalition to support Republican border tax
Leading U.S. exporters launch a coalition in support of a House Republican plan for a "border adjustment" tax on all imports.The "American Made Coalition" includes more than 25 U.S. companies, including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL)."American workers and businesses are not competing today on a level playing field with foreign competitors because of an outdated and unfair tax system," says a spokesperson for the group.The group's launch underscores a division in corporate America over the proposal that would cut corporate income tax to 20% from 35%, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20% tax on imports.Retailers, oil refiners and foreign automakers have been lobbying against any big tax on imports, which they say would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products.

Mr. Ricks added that Lilly will be looking at "market-based" solutions to address the high cost of medicines to consumers.

Insulin makers sued over high prices
A lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts district court claims that Sanofi (SNY +0.4%), Novo Nordisk (NVO -0.5%) and Eli Lilly (LLY -1.2%) have conspired to increase the prices of their insulin products in lockstep to a level many patients find unaffordable. It accuses the drug makers of exploiting the U.S. drug pricing system that benefits them and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Whatever the reason, drug prices have, indeed, been skyrocketing. According to a recent study by the American Medical Association, the price of insulin almost tripled from 2002 to 2013.The lawsuit, filed today, alleges that the three companies intentionally raised the list prices of their drugs to gain favorable treatment (i.e., inclusion on "preferred" lists) from PBMs. Instead of competing with each other based on real (market) prices, the companies compete on the basis of the amount paid to PBMs, the driver behind the aggressive price hikes.In a attempt to deflect criticism, some companies have take the initiative to address high drug prices. Last month, for example, Lilly said it would extend a 40% discount off Humalog's list to those patients forced to pay the top price. Novo has pledged to limit its U.S. price increases to less than 10% per year.Brian Henry, spokesman for Express Scripts, the largest PMB in the U.S., offers his spin: "Rebates don't raise drug prices, drug makers raise drug prices."Source: NYT

Lilly abruptly terminates ultra-rapid insulin collaboration with French biopharma Adocia
An "extremely disappointed" and "surprised" Adocia is apparently scratching its corporate head over Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) sudden exit from their December 2014 collaboration to develop Adocia's BioChaperone Lispro, an ultra-rapid insulin, for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Lilly notified Adocia in a letter received yesterday. The Lyon, France-based biopharma outfit apparently perceived  that the partnership was on solid ground since its product candidate had demonstrated significantly better performance that Lilly's Humalog across six clinical studies.Adocia says Lilly's exit means that all rights licensed under their collaboration agreement will revert back to Adocia at no cost. It plans to proceed with Phase 3 studies and will seek an new development and commercialization partner.Adocia will host a conference call on Monday, January 30 to discuss the situation. Details will be provided in a separate press release.

Short sellers backing away from Big Pharma, but only slightly
Now that pro-business Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, many, if not most, large cap stocks are rallying. Big Pharma is an exception, weighed down by slow growth and negative rhetoric from the Commander-in-Chief about high drug prices. The SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (XPH -0.6%), for example, is down over 7% this month.Short sellers have backed off a bit, but only modestly, a clear signal that bearish views continue to dominate the Big Pharma landscape. Examples of recent changes in short interest:Pfizer (PFE -0.1%): 37.93M versus 44.49M in previous period.Merck (MRK): 15.95M vs 17.31M.Teva (TEVA): 19.98M vs 19.47M.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY -0.4%): 12.18M vs 12.53M.Eli Lilly (LLY +0.4%) 10.72M vs 10.76M.Source: 24/7 Wall St.

Vet med industry now dominated by four firms; further mergers unlikely
With the recent sign-off from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, privately held Boehringer Ingelheim is set absorb Sanofi's (SNY -0.1%) animal health unit Merial, making it the number two player in the veterinary medicine field behind Zoetis (ZTS +0.2%). With Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY +0.4%), the four firms control the bulk of the industry.According to Handelsblatt Global's Siegfried Hofman, the concentration of market heft makes further consolidation unlikely, although Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY +1.2%) is rumored to be amenable to divesting its animal health business. Merck would be a likely acquirer. Judging by other transactions, the deal would probably be valued between €6B - 8B.Top dog Zoetis can't get complacent. Boehringer's Joachim Hasenmaier says, "We intend to fight for market leadership." Zoetis generates about 10% more revenue than Boehringer, but it is growing at a slower rate (3% vs 7%).

Lilly and Merck team up in soft tissue cancer
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) expand their existing immuno-oncology collaboration with the initiation of a new study to assess the combination of LARTRUVO (olaratumab) and KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in treatment-experienced patients with advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS).The FDA approved LARTRUVO in October 2016, in combination with the chemo agent doxorubicin, for patients with advanced STS who cannot be cured with radiotherapy or surgery. It recently received conditional approval in Europe for the same patient population.Lilly will sponsor the Phase 1 trial, expected to commence by mid-year.Olaratumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to disrupt the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGF Receptor-alpha) pathway on tumor cells and on cells in the tumor microenvironment.Pembrolizumab helps the immune system fight tumor cells by blocking the interaction between PD-1, a cell surface receptor expressed on T cells and pro-B cells, and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-1 is an immune checkpoint which down regulates the immune system. Blocking its action activates the immune system to attack cancer cells.

Lilly teams up with Express Scripts to offer discounts on insulin
Effective January 1, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) will offer discounts on some of Lilly's insulin products to patients who lack insurance or are in the deductible phase of their high-deductible insurance plans. The discounted prices, up to 40% in certain cases, will be available online and via mobile apps provided by Blink Health.The program covers Humalog, Humulin and Basaglar.Insulin makers have been criticized over pricing. Some have avoided working with PBMs which has eroded their market share. Lilly has worked with PBMs from the get go and it appears to be paying off. Earlier this year, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) included Basaglar on its national formulary, prioritizing it over Sanofi's (NYSE:SNY) Lantus and Toujeo. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has also felt the pinch. It, along with Sanofi, have cut staff in their diabetes units due to pricing pressures.

Lilly not giving up on Alzheimer's, teams up with AstraZeneca to develop early-stage amyloid beta antibody
Undeterred by its solanezumab flop, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) inks an agreement with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) to co-develop MEDI1814, an antibody selective for amyloid beta 42 currently in Phase 1 development. The deal builds on the companies' existing collaboration related to BACE inhibitor AZD3293, in Phase 3 development.Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will pay an upfront fee of $30M to AstraZeneca. Other financial terms are not disclosed.Amyloid beta is type of protein that leads to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, the accumulation of which is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) . Amyloid beta 42 is a form of amyloid beta that is particularly associated with AD.MEDI1814 was originally developed at MedImmune which AstraZeneca acquired for $15.6B in 2007.

Lilly presents detailed results from failed late-stage study of solanezumab in people with mild Alzheimer's-related dementia
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) presented the results from the failed Phase 3 EXPEDITION3 study yesterday at the Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) 2016 Meeting in San Diego.Patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to placebo (p=0.095) from baseline to week 80 as determined by a scale called ADA-Cog14 which measures cognitive functions such as memory, attention and language abilities. This was the primary endpoint.Since the primary endpoint was not met the p-values for the secondary efficacy analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The solanezumab cohort experienced a 13% slowing of cognitive decline versus placebo as measured by a questionnaire called MMSE (p=0.014). The difference in slowing of cognitive decline also favored solanezumab as measured by other scales called CDR-SB (15%; p=0.004) and ADCS-iADL (14%; p=0.019). Measurement by another questionnaire, FAQ, fell short of statistical significance (7%; p=0.140).The difference in the change in amyloid beta between the test group and control was statistically significant, but the change in amyloid deposition as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) was not.Drug-related adverse events included spinal osteoarthritis (1.1%); dysuria (pain while urinating)(0.9%); vitamin D deficiency (1.4%) and nasal congestion (1.2%).Solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a type of protein called amyloid beta after it is produced, allowing it to be cleared from the brain before forming amyloid plaques, the accumulation of which is associated with AD. Drug candidates targeting amyloid plaques have struggled to demonstrate a statistically valid functional treatment benefit, however.Previously: Lilly's solanezumab flunks late-stage study in Alzheimer's-related dementia; shares down 14% premarket; Biogen down 8% in sympathy (Nov. 23)

The potential haircut to future revenue that PDL BioPharma (PDLI -15.2%) faces from Eli Lilly's (LLY -10.5%) solanezumab flop was already priced into the stock says RBC's Adnan Butt. PDL was eligible to receive royalties on solanezumab sales.He calls the sell-off an "overreaction" and adds that the most significant near-term catalyst is Novartis' (NVS +1%) hypertension drug Tekturna (aliskiren), which the company owns a piece of through its initial $75M equity investment in Noden Pharma DAC (Noden acquired global rights from Novartis). PDL expects to invest an additional $64M by next year.

Lilly-stoked premarket selling grabs Merck, shares down 3%
Merck (NYSE:MRK) slumps 3% premarket on higher-than-normal volume as the selling spreads from the disappointing Phase 3 results for Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Alzheimer's disease (AD) candidate solanezumab.Merck's late-stage AD candidate is verubecestat (MK-8931), an inhibitor of an enzyme called BACE which plays a key role in the production of amyloid beta peptides. Inhibiting BACE is believed to decrease the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain thereby slowing the progression of AD.A Phase 3 study called APECS is currently recruiting patients. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to week 104 in a scale called CDR-SB (same scale Biogen is using in its late-stage studies of aducanumab). According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the estimated final data collection date for the primary endpoint is May 2019. The estimated study completion date is March 2021.

Lilly's solanezumab flunks late-stage study in Alzheimer's-related dementia; shares down 14% premarket; Biogen down 8% in sympathy
A Phase 3 study, EXPEDITION3, assessing Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) solanezumab in people with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), failed to show a significant treatment effect compared to placebo as measured by a scale called ADAS-Cog14. The results favored solanezumab but the differences were small.The company is evaluating its options but will not pursue regulatory submissions for the indication. Detailed results will be presented on Thursday, December 8 at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease meeting.Solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to forms of type of protein called amyloid beta after it is produced, allowing it to be cleared from the brain before forming amyloid plaques, the accumulation of which is associated with AD. Drug candidates targeting amyloid plaques have struggled to demonstrate a statistically valid functional treatment benefit, however. This is yet another example.Lilly expects to record a Q4 charge of ~$150M ($0.09/share after-tax). It will release revised 2016 guidance and its 2017 outlook on December 15 along with a conference call at 9:00 am ET instead of the previously scheduled call on January 4.Shares are down 14% premarket on increased volume.Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is down 8% premarket on light volume. It is developing another amyloid-related monoclonal antibody for AD called aducanumab.

Lilly and AstraZeneca's AZD3293 Fast Track'd for early Alzheimer's
The FDA designates Phase 3-stage AZD3293 for Fast Track review for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). AZD3293 inhibits an enzyme called BACE (beta secretase cleaving enzyme) which plays a key role in the formation of myelin sheaths in peripheral nerve cells. In theory, inhibiting BACE will prevent the accumulation of beta-amyloid and slow the progression of AD.A Phase 2/3 study in early AD, AMARANTH, should be completed in August 2019. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating at Week 104. A second Phase 3, DAYBREAK-ALZ, in patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia should commence this quarter. Its primary endpoint is the change from baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale Score at Week 78. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the estimated final data collection date for the primary endpoint is August 2019. The estimated study completion date is April 2021.Fast Track status provides for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team and a rolling review of the New Drug Application (NDA).AZD3293 is being co-developed and will be co-commercialized by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) under their 2014 strategic alliance. Lilly leads clinical development, assisted by AstraZeneca's Neuroscience Research and Development Team, while AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing. Both firms will commercialize and will equally share future costs for development and commercialization as well as net revenues after launch.Previously: Lilly and AstraZeneca Alzheimer's candidate advances; AstraZeneca earns $100M milestone (April 8) Aug. 22, 2016, 7:31 AM | 2 Comments
Nymox readies marketing application for BPH drug fexapotide; shares up 31%
Micro cap Nymox Pharmaceutical (NYMX +31.4%) perks up on more than a 12x surge in volume in response to its announcement that it expects to file a marketing application (presumably in the U.S.) within the next two quarters seeking approval of fexapotide for the treatment of men with an enlarged prostate, called benign prostate hyperplasia or BPH. In addition, the company says it does not envision needing more cash for the pre-marketing development of fexapotide (it will need new capital for commercialization, though). It intends to partner with a larger company once fexapotide is approved, provided satisfactory terms can be agreed upon.Fexapotide is administered directly into the prostate via a transrectal injection that does not require anesthesia or sedation. Results from long-term studies (seven years of follow-up) showed a prostate cancer incidence rate of only 1.3% in men treated with fexapotide compared to ~23% in the general population and ~20% in men treated with PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) Viagra, Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Cialis, Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY) and GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) Levitra].Previously: Nymox's lead product candidate reduces incidence of prostate cancer in long-term study; shares up 29% (June 22) Aug. 11, 2016, 1:06 PM | 7 Comments

Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim announce clinical trial collaboration in late-stage breast cancer
Eli Lilly (LLY +0.4%) and Boehringer Ingelheim announce a new collaboration on a Phase 1b study that will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Abemaciclib (LY2835219), Lilly's cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK 6 inhibitor, in combination with BI 836845, Boehringer Ingelheim's insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1/IGF-2 ligand neutralizing antibody, in patients diagnosed with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Enrollment is scheduled to begin in Q4.Boehringer Ingelheim's BI 836845 is an IGF ligand-neutralizing antibody that binds to both IGF-1 and IGF-2 preventing activation of the respective receptor resulting in decreased growth-promoting signaling, which may decrease tumor growth.The rationale for the collaboration is based upon the hypothesis that the combination could offer more complete pathway interference and could potentially prolong cell cycle arrest. For HR+, HER2- mBC patients, this could translate to a reversal of resistance to hormone therapy. Jul. 13, 2016, 9:46 AM
FDA Ad Comm to review Boehringer Ingelheim's applications for CV risk claims for diabetes meds
The FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee will meet tomorrow to review and discuss Boehringer Ingelheim's supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDAs) for type 2 diabetes meds Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Synjardy (empagliflozin/metformin HCl) seeking approval for the claim of reducing the risk of all-cause mortality by reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in high cardiovascular risk adults with type 2 diabetes.FDA briefing docBI briefing doc Draft Questions Update: The committee voted 12-11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces CV death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established CV disease.Related ticker: (NYSE:LLY) Jun. 27, 2016, 4:17 PM

Lilly's abemaciclib shows positive treatment effect in breast cancer patients with poor outlooks in mid-stage study
Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial, MONARCH 1, assessing Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) abemaciclib in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer showed a positive treatment effect. The data were presented yesterday at ASCO16 in Chicago.The study enrolled 132 subjects who received 200 mg of abemaciclib orally every 12 hours until cancer progression. All patients were heavily pretreated and had poor prognoses. After a minimum of 12 months of follow up, the overall response rate (ORR) (complete responders + partial responders + stable disease) was 19.7%  with a median time to response of 3.7 months and median duration of response of 8.6 months. Median progression-free survival was six months with a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 42.4% (CBR = ORR at least six months). Of the 13 patients who remained on treatment at the data cutoff, 69.2% (n=9/13) were responders and 30.8% (n=4/13) had stable disease.The safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous Phase 1 experience. The most common treatment-related serious (grade 3) or higher adverse events were diarrhea (19.7%) and fatigue (12.9%). The most frequent adverse events were grade 3 neutropenia (low level of a type of white blood cell) (22.3%) and grade 3 leukopenia (low level of white blood cells) (27.4%).Lilly intends to publish additional data from MONARCH-1 later this year.Abemaciclib is being evaluated in two ongoing Phase 3 studies: MONARCH-2, in combination with fulvestrant, in HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women and MONARCH-3, in combination with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, in HR+/HER2- locally/regionally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women.Abemaciclib is a cell cycle inhibitor that is designed to block the growth of cancer cells by inhibiting the enzymes CDK4 andCDK6.

Drug prices to continue upward march according to bullish analyst
According to Leerink's Geoff Porges, drug makers appear to be taking little heed to politicians' outcries over high prices. In a research note, he says, "The price increases for established brands across our coverage have been substantial indeed. To the surprise of many investors, it now appears these price increases are likely to flow through to actual sales growth, with such growth more than offsetting any volume weakness in Q1 and resulting in significant positive revenue surprises for those companies when they report Q1 results."He cites Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ +0.8%) Q1 results released yesterday. Its total business was flat (+0.6%) but its pharmaceuticals unit was up 12.9%. His analysis showed as much as 90% of the list price increases are flowing through to reported sales, some as high as 100%.Over the past year, Amgen (AMGN +0.7%) increased its drug prices 8 - 28%, Gilead Sciences (GILD +0.9%) 10 - 18% for its HIV drugs and Biogen (BIIB -1.6%) 10 - 18%, according to Mr. Porges.Biogen reports tomorrow.

Lilly and BI prepare for two CV outcomes studies to support Jardiance CV claim
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and co-developer Boehringer Ingelheim announce plans to conduct two outcomes studies assessing diabetes med Jardiance (empagliflozin) for the treatment patients with chronic heart failure. The trials should commence within the next 12 months and will enroll participants with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D).Jardiance was the first diabetes drug to show a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in a dedicated CV outcomes trial. The study, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, demonstrated that treatment with Jardiance plus standard of care reduced CV death by 38% and reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in T2D patients at high risk of CV events.Lilly's supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) seeking approval of a CV reduction claim for Jardiance is currently under FDA review.Read now Eli Lilly: Regulatory Risk Is A Factor  Apr. 19, 2016, 8:33 AM
Lilly bags development of Transition Therapeutics' diabetes candidate TT401
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) informs Transition Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TTHI) that will not advance TT401 into Phase 3 development. Under the terms of their collaboration agreement, all rights to the diabetes product candidate will be transferred back to Transition. Lilly will be eligible to receive a royalty on future TT401 sales and a royalty of on non-royalty income. The royalty that Transition is eligible to receive on sales of related Lilly compounds remains in place.A recently completed Phase 2 study in 420 type 2 diabetics who received the highest dose of TT401 administered once per week showed superior weight loss compared to currently available extended-release exenatide [AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN) Bydureon] and placebo after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. It also showed similar HbA1c reduction as exenatide over the same treatment periods.TT401 is an oxyntomodulin analog with a dual mechanism of action on the GLP1 and Glucagon receptors, similar to Lilly's Trulicity (dulaglutide). Lilly opted out because TT401 did not demonstrate a significant advantage in lowering HbA1c.Previously: Transition's type 2 diabetes candidate shows positive results in mid-stage study but shares slump 32% on risk that Lilly will back out of development (Feb. 1) Apr. 18, 2016, 7:17 AM | 7 Comments
Can-Fite Bio's ED candidate shows full recovery single dose; shares up 7% premarket
Can-Fite BioPharma (NYSEMKT:CANF) announces that its candidate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), CF602, showed statistically significant full recovery one hour after a single 500 u/kg dose in a preclinical diabetic rat model.According to the company, CF602's novel mechanism of action may provide a treatment benefit to patients who do not respond adequately to PDE5 inhibitors [Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) Viagra (sildenafil citrate), Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Cialis (tadalafil), Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY) and GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) Levitra (vardenafil HCl)].Last October, the company announced the results from a preclinical study that showed CF602 restored the impaired vascular endothelial growth factor system in the penises of diabetic rats which induced an increase in nitric oxide which resulted in improved penile erection compared to placebo. Its unique mechanism of action is apparently similar to Viagra. The company intends to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) with the FDA in Q4.Shares are up 7% premarket on increased volume.Previously: Can-Fite's CF602 shows Viagra-like action in diabetic rats; shares up 10% premarket (Oct. 22, 2015) Apr. 11, 2016, 8:24 AM | 2 Comments

Lilly and AstraZeneca Alzheimer's candidate advances; AstraZeneca earns $100M milestone
Based on an interim safety analysis by the independent Data Monitoring Committee, the Phase 2/3 study, AMARANTH, assessing AZD3293 (LY3314814) for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) will advance to Phase 3 without modification. According to clinicaltrials.gov, the estimated final data collection date for the primary endpoint, the change in Clinical Dementia Rating at week 104, is August 2019. The estimated study completion date is August 2021.AZD3293 (LY3314814), an inhibitor of an enzyme called BACE (beta secretase cleaving enzyme), is being co-developed and will be co-commercialized by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) under their 2014 strategic alliance. Lilly leads clinical development, assisted by AstraZeneca's Neuroscience Research and Development Team, while AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing. Both firms will commercialize and will equally share future costs for development and commercialization as well as net revenues after launch. The advancement of AMARANTH to Phase 3 triggers a $100M milestone payment to AstraZeneca from Lilly.BACE is an enzyme associated with the development of amyloid beta. Inhibiting its action is expected to prevent the formation of amyloid plaque and eventually slow the progression of AD.A new Phase 3 study, DAYBREAK, assessing AZD3293/LY3314814 in patients with mild AD should commence in Q3.

Another late-stage study shows effectiveness of Lilly and Incyte's baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis
A 527-subject Phase 3 clinical trial, RA-BEACON, assessing once-daily oral baricitinib for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), met its primary endpoint of improved ACR 20 response (20% improvement in RA symptoms) compared to placebo at week 12. The results were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.The ACR 20 response rates were 55% for baricitinib 4 mg, 49% for baricitinib 2 mg and 27% for placebo (p <= 0.001).Baricitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2, enzymes that play key roles in a range of inflammatory diseases.

Amgen's romosozumab successful in late-stage study in men with osteoporosis
Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and co-developer UCB (OTCPK:UCBJF)(OTCPK:UCBJY) announce that the Phase 3 study, BRIDGE, assessing romosozumab in men with osteoporosis met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine compared to placebo at month 12.All secondary endpoints were also met. Subjects receiving romosozumab showed statistically valid increases in BMD at the femoral neck and total hip at month 12 and statistically valid increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip at month 6, both versus placebo.The study enrolled 245 men who were randomized 2:1 to receive either a monthly subcutaneous injection of romosozumab (210 mg) or placebo for 12 months.The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the arms. The most frequent (>5%) were nasopharyngitis, back pain, hypertension, headache and constipation. Injection site reactions were reported in 5.5% of patients in the romosozumab cohort compared to 3.7% in the placebo group. Most were mild in severity. The incidence of confirmed cardiovascular (CV) serious adverse events (SAEs) was 4.9% (n=8/163) for romosozumab and 2.5% (n=2/81) for placebo. Both arms had one confirmed CV death.The results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical conference. The companies intend to discuss the data with global regulators.Romosozumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, a protein that has anti-anabolic effects on bone formation. It has a dual effect of increasing bone formation and decreasing bone breakdown.Related ticker: (NASDAQ:RDUS)(NYSE:LLY) Mar. 21, 2016, 7:20 AM | 8 Comments
Lilly changes primary endpoint in late-stage study of Alzheimer's candidate solanezumab
Citing the emergence of scientific evidence that supports the view that cognitive decline precedes functional decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, Eli Lilly (LLY -5.8%) changes the primary endpoint in its solanezumab Phase 3 clinical trial, EXPEDITION3, to a single cognition measure called ADAS-Cog14 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale). The former co-primary endpoint measuring function outcome, a daily activity metric called ADCS-iADL and a questionnaire called FAQ, will now be considered a secondary endpoint.The conduct of the trial will remain unchanged. According to clinicaltrials.gov, the estimated final data collection date for the primary endpoint is October 2016. The estimated study completion date is October 2018. The company is submitting the required amendment to regulatory authorities.Solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to forms of type of protein called amyloid beta after it is produced, allowing it to be cleared from the brain before forming amyloid plaques, the accumulation of which is associated with AD.Drug candidates targeting amyloid plaques have struggled to demonstrate a statistically valid functional treatment benefit in AD patients, however. If solanezumab shows a cognitive benefit, it may be enough for approval. Mar. 15, 2016, 10:20 AM | 1 Comment

Transition's type 2 diabetes candidate shows positive results in mid-stage study but shares slump 32% on risk that Lilly will back out of development
Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial run by Eli Lilly (LLY -1.1%) assessing LY2944876 (Transition Therapeutics' (TTHI -31.5%) TT401) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes showed statistically significant improvements (up to reductions of 1.43%) in HbA1c levels compared to placebo but similar to AstraZeneca's (AZN +0.6%) Bydureon (exenatide).On the plus side, patients receiving the 50 mg dose of TT401 experienced statistically valid weight loss of up to 3.3 kg versus both placebo and exenatide at Weeks 12 and 24.The data will be presented at a future scientific meeting.TT401 has a dual mechanism of action, similar to Lilly's Trulicity (dulaglutide). Investors appear to perceive that Lilly may opt out of proceeding to Phase 3 development since there was no significant advantage in lowering HbA1c levels over Bydureon. Lilly abandoned another Transition diabetes candidate, TT-223, in 2008. Feb. 1, 2016, 11:52 AM | 5 Comments

Lilly-connected Chinese firm loses five years of financial documents in theft
Beijing-based China Animal Healthcare, 20% owned by Eli Lilly (LLY +0.8%), reports that it lost five years of financial records after the truck carrying the documents in route to a storage facility was stolen. The alleged crime occurred in the city of Baoding while the driver took a lunch break.Trading in the Hong Kong-listed firm has been suspended since March due to an investigation into its accounts so the loss of such a large volume of documents will raise eyebrows for investors. Chinese authorities have been cracking down on corporate bad behavior in an effort to bolster confidence in its markets and its ability to effectively regulate them, making the theft particularly ill-timed.According to Reuters, calls to the company have not been answered.Lilly's Elanco animal health division invested ~$100M in the company in 2013.

Lilly and Merck to conduct new KEYTRUDA clinical collaboration in range of tumor types
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) plan to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial in early 2016 to evaluate the combination of Lilly's cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor, abemaciclib (LY2835219), and Merck's KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) across multiple tumor types. Based on the results in the Lilly-sponsored study, the collaboration may progress to a Phase 2 trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer, which Lilly will also sponsor.Abemaciclib is a cell cycle inhibitor that is designed to block the growth of cancer cells by inhibiting the enzymes CDK4 and CDK6. KEYTRUDA helps the immune system fight tumor cells by blocking the interaction between PD-1, a cell surface receptor expressed on T cells and pro-B cells, and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-1 is an immune checkpoint which down regulates the immune system. Blocking its action activates the immune system to attack cancer cells.The companies established a clinical trial collaboration in January to evaluate the combination of KEYTRUDA and various Lilly compounds across a range of cancers.Previously: Lilly and Merck team up in cancer trials (Jan. 13) Dec. 10, 2015, 8:46 AM

Lilly drops basal insulin peglispro development; $55M charge in Q4; full-year guidance unchanged
After engaging with regulatory authorities and outside experts, Eli Lilly (LLY +1.3%) decides to cease development of basal insulin peglispro (BIL) for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetics. Its decision was prompted by the significant investments in time and resources required to better clarify the effects of BIL on liver fat compared to insulin glargine treatment that was observed in the Phase 3 IMAGINE trials. In February, the company announced that is was delaying its regulatory submissions in order to better understand and characterize the effects.Enrique Conterno, President, Lilly Diabetes, says, "While we are encouraged by the efficacy data we observed for BIL, we know that moving forward wold have required a significant amount of time and investment with no assurance that we would find conclusive answers. We are disappointed in the outcome for BIL, but we have an unprecedented opportunity to build upon the industry's broadest diabetes portfolio, which includes six new treatments approved since the middle of 2014."The company will book a $55M charge in Q4 ($0.03 per share after tax). Its full-year earnings guidance will remain unchanged ($2.40 - 2.45 - GAAP; $3.40 - $3.45 - non-GAAP).

Foamix Pharma's FDX104 performs well in preventing EGFRI-induced rash in mid-stage study; shares up 9% premarket
Thinly traded micro cap Foamix Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:FOMX) announces positive top-line results from a 24-subject Phase 2 clinical trial assessing FDX104 for the prevention of moderate-to-severe skin rashes in patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor antibody inhibitors (EGFRI) [Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Erbitux (cetuximab) or Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) Vectibix (panitumumab)] for the treatment of cancers such as colon and head and neck. The acne-like (acneiform) rash is the most common side effect from EGFRI drugs and, if severe enough, treatment should be withheld, reduced or discontinued.Each randomized patient in the study acted as their own control by treating one side of the face with FDX104 and the other with a foam vehicle (placebo) in a blinded manner.Results showed the side treated with FDX104 was better overall than the placebo-treated side. The mean maximal rash severity favored FDX104, 1.33 versus 1.71. 37.5% of patients (n=9/24) developed a Grade 3 rash (severe) on the placebo side compared to 16.7% (n=4/24) on the FDX104 side. The difference in the prevention of severe rash was statistically valid (p<0.05) in favor of FDX104 as measured by the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Other exploratory analyses also trended positively.FDX104, a doxyocycline foam, appeared safe and well-tolerated with no drug-related systemic adverse events observed. Local reactions were noted in six patients with five resolved before the end of the study.The company will host a conference call this morning at 8:30 am ET to discuss the results. Shares are up 9% premarket on light volume. Dec. 3, 2015, 7:41 AM | 1 Comment

The study will be sponsored by Merck and will be open to treatment-naive NSCLC patients regardless of PD-L1 status. A Phase 2 study was initiated earlier this year.Financial terms are not disclosed.ALIMTA is Lilly's number two seller, booking $2.6B in sales over the past four quarters. It is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of NSCLC, in combination with chemo.KEYTRUDA , Merck's fastest growing drug (Q3 sales = $352M), is a humanized monoclonal antibody that increases the ability of the body's immune system to fight tumor cells by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.Previously: Lilly and Merck team up in cancer trials (Jan. 13) Nov. 19, 2015, 7:04 AM | 2 Comments
Merck stays the course with 30,000-patient anacetrapib study; DMC recommends continuation with no changes
Based on its analysis of unblinded trial data, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommends Merck's (NYSE:MRK) REVEAL outcomes study of anacetrapib continue with no changes. According to clinicaltrials.gov, the estimated completion date for the 30,000-subject trial is January 2017.Anacetrapib inhibits a protein called cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), which is designed to elevate HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol). CETP inhibitors were all the rage a few years ago over their potential to provide more cardioprotective benefits than lowering LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol). Big Pharma's efforts to push CETP inhibitors over the finish line hit fell flat due to toxicity and less-than-expected efficacy. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) all abandoned their programs.Merck has not given up, however. It ran a 1,623-subject study, DEFINE, which showed that anacetrapib was both safe and effective and raised HDL by 150%. REVEAL, initiated in 2011, is designed to settle the issue once and for all. The trial will cost upwards of $500M to complete so the company is banking on a positive outcome. Nov. 13, 2015, 8:33 AM | 4 Comments

Lilly's ixekizumab shows positive effects in patients with psoriatic arthritis in late-stage study
Results from a Phase 3 clinical trial, SPIRIT-P1, showed treatment with Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) ixekizumab significantly improved signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis in patients who had not been previously treated with a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD). The data were presented today at the American College of Rheumatology/Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals Annual Meeting in San Francisco.The 417-subject, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled study assessed ixekizumab 80mg dosed via subcutaneous injection every two or four weeks following a 160 mg starting dose. AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) Humira (adalimumab) 40 mg subcutaneous injection dosed every other week served as the active control for comparison to placebo. It was not powered to compare ixekizumab to adalimumab.At week 24, 62% of the ixekizumab two week cohort and 58% of the four week cohort achieved ACR20 (20% improvement in symptoms) compared to 30% for placebo. The proportions achieving ACR50 (50% improvement in symptoms) were 47%, 40% and 15%, respectively. The proportions achieving ACR70 were 34%, 23% and 6%, respectively.Patients receiving Humira achieved ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 scores of 57%, 39% and 26%, respectively, at week 24.Patients treated with ixekizumab also showed improvements versus placebo in physical function and less radiographic progression of structural joint damage.Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by the immune system's T cells. In psoriasis, IL-17A plays a major role in the excess proliferation and activation of skin cells.Previously: Lilly's ixekizumab successful in Phase 3 psoriatic arthritis trial (April 20) Nov. 8, 2015, 9:39 PM | 3 Comments

Fourth late-stage study again shows superiority of oral baricitinib to injectable Humira in rheumatoid arthritis
Top-line results from a Phase 3 clinical trial, RA-BEAM, showed that Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Incyte's (NASDAQ:INCY) orally administered baricitinib was superior to AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) injectable Humira (adalimumab) in improving symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA-BEAM evaluated the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in RA patients who failed to respond to methotrexate therapy compared to placebo for 24 weeks or Humira for 52 weeks. More than 1,300 participants were randomized to receive either 4 mg oral baricitinib once-daily on background methotrexate, 40 mg injectable Humira every other week on background methotrexate or placebo on background methotrexate.The study met its primary endpoint a statistically significant proportion of patients achieving ACR20 (20% improvement in RA symptoms) at week 12 versus placebo. In addition, at week 24, baricitinib was superior to placebo in preventing progressive structural joint damage. The treatment benefits of baricitinib observed at weeks 12 and 24 were maintained through 52 weeks of therapy.More patients receiving baricitinib achieved ACR20 after 12 weeks of therapy as well as improved DAS28-hsCRPscore (measurement of disease activity and coronary risk) compared to Humira.Serious adverse events were comparable between placebo and baricitinib. The most common were nasopharyngitis and bronchitis.The results will be submitted for publication and presentation at future medical conferences in 2016.Baricitinib is a once-daily, orally administered, selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, enzymes that play key roles in a range of inflammatory diseases. It is being co-developed by Lilly and Incyte under an exclusive global license and collaboration agreement inked in December 2009. Oct. 14, 2015, 7:49 AM | 7 Comments
Eli Lilly establishes research collaboration focused on T cell-based immuno-oncology therapies
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) enters into a preclinical research collaboration with Inglewood, CA-based ImaginAb to study potential novel T cell-based immuno-oncology therapies.

Lilly's CYRAMZA improves PFS in mid-stage bladder cancer study
Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing Eli Lilly's (LLY -4.8%) CYRAMZA (ramucirumab), in combination with docetaxel, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who failed prior platinum-based treatment showed a statistically significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS). The results were presented at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna, Austria.Participants in the three-arm 140-subject trial were randomized to receive either a combination of ramucirumab and docetaxel (n=46), docetaxel alone (n=45) or a combination of icrucumab and docetaxel (n=49). Therapy continued until disease progression or an elevation in toxicity levels that interrupted treatment.Median PFS in the three arms was 5.4 months, 2.8 months and 1.6 months, respectively (p<0.001). Objective response (complete or partial) rate (ORR) was 24%, 9% and 12%, respectively. The disease control (response + stable disease) rate (DCR) was 78%, 58% and 45%, respectively. The DCR results were also statistically significant. Overall survival (OS) also favored ramucirumab, but the trial was not powered for statistical validation.The incidence of serious adverse events in the ramucirumab arm was consistent with prior Phase 3 trials. The most common (at least grade 3) were fatigue (35%), febrile neutropenia (17%), pneumonia (13%), anemia (13%), sepsis (11%), edema (9%) and six others (7% each).A Phase 3 study, RANGE, is now underway.CYRAMZA, VEGF Receptor 2 antagonist, is currently cleared for the second-line treatment of gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, the second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and the second-line treatment of colorectal cancer.

Eli Lilly (LLY +1.9%) says the FDA's approved Synjardy (empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride) for treating adults with type 2 diabetes -- the fifth approval to come from a diabetes drug alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals.It's the third product with empagliflozin, which removes excess glucose through the urine by blocking re-absorption in the kidney. Metformin works in a complementary way, lowering glucose production by the liver.The treatment also got approval from the European Medicines Agency in May.Previously: Large scale CVOT shows superiority of Jardiance in reducing CV risk in type 2 diabetics (Aug. 20 2015) Aug. 27, 2015, 10:48 AM
Eli Lilly says court rules in its favor on Alimta patent
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) says a U.S. federal court ruled that generic products proposed by a unit of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) would infringe a U.S. patent for LLY’s blockbuster cancer drug Alimta.The patent, which covers the administration of Alimta to patients with a vitamin regimen, provides intellectual property protection until May 2022, potentially preserving U.S. market exclusivity for Alimta until then, rather than allowing generic competition in 2017 when a separate patent expires.Teva had challenged a March 2014 ruling that upheld the validity of the vitamin regimen patent.

Large scale CVOT shows superiority of Jardiance in reducing CV risk in type 2 diabetics
Top line results from a 7,000-subject clinical trial, called EMPA-REG OUTCOME, show that Jardiance (empagliflozin), when added to standard of care, was superior in lowering cardiovascular (CV) risk in type 2 diabetics. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of either CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. About half of the deaths of people with type 2 diabetes are caused by CV disease.Full results will be presented on September 17 at the 51st European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting in Stockholm, Sweden.Jardiance, co-developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), is the only glucose-lowering drug that has demonstrated CV risk reduction. It was cleared in Europe in May 2014 and in the U.S. in July 2014.Related tickers: (NYSE:SNY) (NYSE:NVO) (NYSE:AZN) Aug. 20, 2015, 8:01 AM | 1 Comment
Pfizer and Bristol-Myers lead in resurgent immune system accelerators for the treatment of cancer
A new class of cancer therapeutics has been rekindled of late led by Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). They are called immune system accelerators, antibodies that target a protein called 4-1BB, also known as CD137.When the immune system's T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells identify cancer cells, the 4-1BB protein appears on their surfaces which accelerates their attack. The protein was discovered over 20 years ago, but its development was abandoned in 2008 after early-stage studies done by Bristol showed signs of liver damage. Scientists eventually realized that lower doses of 4-1BB, given at the right time, could elicit the desired anti-cancer effect without the unwanted toxicity. Early results have been impressive. A 38-subject study done by Pfizer, 40% of patients with follicular lymphoma and a third of those with mantle cell lymphoma experienced a reduction in cancer with no serious side effects.Phase 1 studies are underway assessing combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors, like Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) Rituxan (rituximab) and accelerators. Studies are planned for Pfizer's 4-1BB candidate in combination with Herceptin (trastuzumab) and the combination of Bristol's 4-1BB candidate, urelumab, with Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Erbitux (cetuximab). Bristol in currently enrolling patients in five Phase 1 studies in multiple myeloma, lymphomas and solid tumor cancers. Pfizer is planning trials with an immunotherapy from Kyowa Hakko Kirin and Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) are a step behind doing preclinical work on their accelerator candidates.

Biocept launches first liquid biopsy test for colorectal cancer; shares up 10% premarket
Nano cap Biocept (NASDAQ:BIOC) launches its proprietary quantitative Target Selector assay targeting KRAS mutations, a predictive biomarker in cancer. The assay is performed on a blood sample (liquid biopsy) instead of a tissue biopsy which allows physicians to more easily monitor cancer patients for response to treatment and progression of disease.~40% of colorectal cancer patients are KRAS mutation positive. KRAS is also present in high frequency in other solid tumor cancers including lung and pancreatic cancers. Patients with the mutation are much more resistant to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies such as Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) Vectibix (panitumumab) and Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Erbitux (cetuximab).Investors should keep an eye on the uptake of this test. If robust, then it validates its value proposition of a more convenient, cheaper and much less invasive method of monitoring cancer patients. To date, investors appear to lack confidence in the company's prospects. Shares are down 76% since its IPO at $10 in February 2014.Shares are up 10% premarket on light volume. Aug. 5, 2015, 7:35 AM
Boehringer Ingelheim teams up with Hanmi Pharma on 3rd gen EGFR candidate
Privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) enters into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Seoul, Korea-based Hanmi Pharmaceutical to develop and commercialize HM61713, a third generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer.Under the terms of the agreement, Hanmi will receive an upfront payment of $50M, milestones up to $680M and tiered double-digit royalties on net sales. BI will have exclusive global commercialization rights to HM61713 except South Korea, China and Hong Kong.HM61713 is an orally active, irreversible EGFR mutation-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer with T790M mutations who have developed resistance to other EGFR-targeting agents. A Phase 3 study will commence next year.EGFR-related tickers: (AZN +0.3%)(OTCQX:RHHBY +1.3%)(OTCPK:ALPMY) (OTCPK:ALPMF) (BMY +0.1%)(LLY +1.4%)(GSK -0.1%)(AMGN +4.3%) Jul. 28, 2015, 12:57 PM
Lilly to continue late-stage evacetrapib study; results expected mid-2016
Based on an interim futility analysis by the independent data monitoring committee, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) will continue its Phase 3 study, ACCELERATE, of evacetrapib for the potential treatment of high-risk cardiovascular (CV) disease. The interim futility test is designed to assess whether the drug candidate has any possibility of achieving its efficacy endpoints. The best case scenario would have been an early stop to the trial, typically recommended when the efficacy endpoints have been met. Since the committee recommended continuing until the planned July 2016 study end date, the efficacy versus placebo has yet to be demonstrated statistically. SVP and President of Lilly Bio-Medicines David Ricks says, "While pleased that the trial continues, we need to complete the ACCELERATE study to understand the potential for evacetrapib."The primary endpoint of the 12,095-subject, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary revascularization or hospitalization for unstable angina (UA).Secondary endpoints include mean change from baseline to three months in low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization or hospitalization for UA from baseline through the end of the study (July 2016).Evacetrapib is a selective inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma protein the facilitates the transport of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between the lipoproteins. It is being investigated for its potential to raise HDL-C (good cholesterol) and lower LDL-C (bad cholesterol), thereby modifying the risk of cardiovascular disease. Jul. 27, 2015, 9:02 AM

Ad Comm approaches for Lilly's necitumumab BLA
The FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meets on Thursday, July 9 to discuss Eli Lilly's (LLY +1%) Biologics License Application (BLA) seeking approval for necitumumab, in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer.Necitumumab is a recombinant IgG1 human monoclonal antibody that binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).One area of concern is necitumumab's safety profile. A Phase 3 study, called INSPIRE, was stopped early at the request of the data monitoring committee in light of an imbalance in the number of deaths attributed to potential thromboembolic events (TEs) (blood clots). The incidence of TEs in INSPIRE in the necitumumab arm was 11% compared to 6% for the control arm. In another Phase 3, called SQUIRE, TE rates were 9% and 5%, respectively. Overall, though, necitumumab appears to be as safe as other anti-EGFR therapies.FDA briefing materialLilly briefing material Jul. 7, 2015, 12:48 PM
ArQule's lead product candidate shows 52% disease control rate in certain colorectal cancer patients
An interim analysis of a Phase 2 study assessing ArQule's (ARQL -3.1%) lead product candidate, tivantinib, in combination with Erbitux (cetuximab), in patients with MET-High, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer who recently progressed on anti-EGFR therapies showed a 52.4% disease control rate (DCR). The data were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology World GI 2015 meeting in Milan, Italy.In 21 patients enrolled in the first stage of the trial, one experienced a complete response (CR), two experienced durable partial responses (PRs) and eight showed stable disease (SD). The DCR was, therefore, 52.4% (n=11/21). 20 additional patients were enrolled in the second stage.The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) in the biomarker defined population. ORR frequently correlates with overall survival (OS) benefit.Final results from the complete 41-patient study are expected by the end of the year.Related tickers: (BMY +0.2%)(LLY -0.2%) Jul. 6, 2015, 10:08 AM
Eli Lilly and Immunocore team up in melanoma; early stage trials to start in 2016
Eli Lilly (LLY -0.8%) and privately-held Immunocore Ltd. enter into a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate the utility of Immunocore's lead T cell receptor-based therapeutic candidate, IMCgp100, in combination with Lilly's galunisertib (LY2157299) and merestinib (LY2801653) for the treatment of melanoma, specifically metastatic cutaneous and uveal melanomas.Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will sponsor a Phase 1b/2 study of IMCgp100 and galunisertib in metastatic cutaneous melanoma and another Phase 1b/2 assessing IMCgp100 and merestinib in metastatic uveal melanoma. Both studies will commence in 2016. Additional terms are not disclosed. The firms began their partnership in July 2014.IMGgp100 was developed under Immunocore's ImmTAC platform, which produces drugs with a high affinity for intracellular cancer targets.Galunisertib is an inhibitor of TGF beta R1 kinase, which selectively blocks TGF beta signaling. TGF beta promotes tumor growth, suppresses the immune system and increases tumors' ability to metastasize.Merestinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that blocks four key signaling pathways.

Lilly prevails over Actavis in Alimta patent case in the UK; ruling has implications in other countries
The Court of Appeal in the UK rules that Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) patent for its Alimta (pemetrexed) vitamin regimen would be indirectly infringed by certain alternate salt forms of pemetrexed proposed by potential competitor Actavis (NYSE:AGN). Lilly's UK patent is in effect until June 2021.The Court also held that there is no difference between the law in the UK and that in France, Italy and Spain as it relates to indirect infringement. This reverses the High Court's decision granting declarations of noninfringement over the Alimta vitamin regimen patents in those countries.Actavis may seek an appeal to the UK Supreme Court. It may also ask the High Court if a different proposed product would infringe the patent, as it has stated it may do.The compounded patents for Alimta will provide exclusivity through December 2015 in Europe. If the Court of Appeal's ruling holds, there is a strong likelihood that the vitamin regimen patents will provide exclusivity in France, Italy and Spain through June 2021.Alimta is Lilly's number two seller after Humalog, generating $2.7B in sales the past four quarters.

Certain cancer meds fair poorly per new rating scale gauging overall benefits
In an effort to simplify the complex statistics behind cancer drugs, a group of U.S. oncologists has devised a 0 to 100 rating scale that aims to assess a drug's overall benefit (extend life or delay cancer progression) versus its potential side effects. The scale to rate drugs used for advanced cancers goes up to 130. The ultimate goal is to put the data in a user-friendly mobile software app that doctors can use at the bedside. The scale was published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.How did some leading drugs fare? Well, not so good. A regimen including Eli Lilly's (LLY +0.5%) Alimta (pemetrexed), which costs ~$9,200/month, rated a big fat zero. Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY +1.8%) Herceptin (trastuzumab) scored the highest at 48, but Avastin (bevacizumab), which costs almost $12,000/month, only managed a score of 16, as did Sanofi's (SNY +4.7%) Jevtana (cabazitaxel).Scores cannot be compared against each other since the ratings are based on older drugs that the newer ones were tested against in clinical studies. Also, drug costs are not directly included.ASCO is now soliciting comments on the proposed system. Representatives from the drugs and insurance industries provided input into the design of the scale.

Lilly's Cyramza flunks Phase 3 trial in liver cancer; new one planned
A Phase 3 study, called REACH, evaluating Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Cyramza (ramucirumab) as second-line treatment [after Nexavar (sorafenib)] in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) failed to achieve its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS). Median OS in the Cyramza plus best supportive care (BSC) arm was 9.2 months versus 7.6 months in the placebo plus BSC arm (p=0.1391). The results were published in The Lancet Oncology.A prespecified subgroup of HCC patients with elevated baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a liver enzyme, did show a statistically valid improvement in survival after receiving ramucirumab. Median OS was 7.8 months compared to 4.2 months for placebo (p=0.0059).The company plans to conduct an new Phase 3 study, called REACH-2, to assess Cyramza in a second-line setting in patients with elevated AFP. Enrollment will begin shortly.Cyramza is currently approved for the treatment of certain colorectal, gastric and lung cancers and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Related tickers: (NASDAQ:AMGN) (OTCPK:BAYRY) Jun. 19, 2015, 9:02 AM
Lilly's migraine candidate successful in mid-stage study
A Phase 2b study evaluating Eli Lilly's (LLY -1.4%) investigational LY2951742 for the prevention of migraine successfully achieved its objective. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the safety and efficacy of four different doses of LY2951742 administered via a once-monthly injection in more than 400 patients with episodic migraine (between four and 14 migraine headaches per month). The primary efficacy endpoint was showing at least one dose of LY2951742 was superior to placebo.The data will be presented on June 20 at the 57th Annual American Headache Society meeting in Washington, D.C.LY2951742 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide ((CGRP)), a potent vasodilator that is involved in migraine-causing neurogenic inflammation. Lilly acquired the rights to LY2951742 from inventor Arteaus Therapeutics in January 2014. Jun. 17, 2015, 1:06 PM

Lilly's ixekizumab successful in two late-stage trials
Eli Lilly (LLY -0.5%) announces the results from two Phase 3 studies, just published in The Lancet, evaluating ixekizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Both trials, called UNCOVER 2 & 3, met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority to etanercept [Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) Enbrel] and placebo.Approximately 90% of patients treated with ixekizumab every two weeks achieved PASI 75 (at least a 75% reduction in severity of psoriasis from baseline) at week 12 while ~50% achieved PASI 75 by week 4. About 40% of patients achieved total skin clearance or PASI 100. Almost 60% of patients reported that psoriasis no longer impacted their quality of life.Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by the immune system's T cells. In psoriasis, IL-17A plays a major role in the excess proliferation and activation of skin cells.Psoriasis affects nearly 8M Americans. About 17% (~1.4M) have moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

AstraZeneca and Lilly collaborate on cancer drug combo
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) enter into a clinical trial collaboration to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of AZN's MEDI4736 in combination with LLY's Cyramza (ramucirumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors. A Phase 1 study will establish the safety and recommended dosing regimen, with the potential to open expansion cohorts in various tumors of interest. LLY will sponsor the trial.MEDI4736 is a monoclonal antibody known as a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) is a protein found on the surface of cancer cells that enable them to avoid detection by the immune system. Binding to PD-L1 enables T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells.Cyramza is an antiangiogenic therapy known as a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Receptor 2 antagonist. It inhibits the growth of tumors by restricting the formation of new blood vessels that fuel their expansion.This collaboration is another example of the consensus that a combination of cancer drugs, sometimes a cocktail, is the most effective way to fight cancers.

FDA warns on potential side effect of new diabetes drugs
The FDA issues a warning that type 2 diabetic patients taking drugs called sodium-glucose contransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors to lower their blood sugar may have increased risk of developing ketoacidosis, a serious condition characterized by the buildup of acids, called ketones, in the blood that can be life-threatening if untreated for an extended period. It is caused by an insulin deficiency which forces cells to burn fat for energy instead of glucose which produces ketones.The agency is investigating the issue to determine if the safety risk warrants changes to the labeling of currently approved medications. There were 20 reported cases of ketoacidosis in the period from March 2013 to June 6, 2014, all of which required emergency room visits or hospitalization.SGLT-2 inhibitors cleared for sale in the U.S. are Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana (canagliflozin) and Invokamet (canagliflozin/metformin); AstraZeneca's (AZN -1.4%) Farxiga (dapagliflozin) and Xigduo XR (dapagliflozin/metformin); Eli Lilly (LLY -0.5%) and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Glyxambi (empagliflozin/linagliptin).

Amgen migraine candidate successful in Phase 2 study but only at highest dose
A Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) fully monoclonal antibody, AMG 334, for the prevention of migraine met its primary efficacy endpoint of reducing monthly mean migraine days versus placebo at a dose of 70 mg. The data were presented at the 17th Congress of the International Headache Society in Valencia, Spain.The randomized 483-subject study compared monthly subcutaneous doses of AMG 334 (7 mg, 21 mg or 70 mg) to placebo in a 3:2:2:2 ratio. The mean baseline was 8.7 migraine days per month. Patients in the 70 mg dose arm showed a statistically significant reduction of 3.4 migraine days per month (p=0.021). The results in the 7 mg and 21 mg arms did not reach statistical significance.Patients receiving the 70 mg dose also demonstrated statistically significant increases in the 50% responder rate compared to placebo (47% vs. 30%), reductions in monthly headache days (-3.54 vs. -2.39) and monthly migraine-specific medication use days (-1.64 vs. -0.69).AMG 334 inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, which is believed to transmit signals that cause incapacitating pain. Two additional Phase 2 trials are in process (NCT02174861 and NCT02066415).Monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of migraines are the "next big thing" in the space. Alder BioPharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALDR) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) also have monoclonals in development. Regulatory clearance remains at least 3-4 years away, though. May 15, 2015, 7:52 AM | 4 Comments

FDA to hold public meeting on off-label drug promotion
Spurred by the progress of a bill moving through Congress that will speed new drugs to market for conditions lacking cures, called The 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has scheduled a public meeting this summer to address concerns by the drugs industry that regulatory restrictions on what they can say about the off-label use of their products violates their First Amendment right to free speech. Language in the bill is ratcheting up the pressure on the agency to relax its guidelines.Drug makers were emboldened on its prospects of changing the rules after an appeals court overturned the conviction of a pharmaceutical sales representative in 2012 who was convicted of promoting off-label uses of the narcolepsy drug Xyrem. The court ruling was based on First Amendment protection for truthful and non-misleading off-label speech.The American Medical Association supports the need for physicians to have access to accurate and unbiased information about off-label uses of drugs since it already accounts for as much as 20% of prescribing, with higher levels in oncology and pediatric rare diseases.Giving drug firms more leeway in this arena has its detractors, however. Rita Redberg, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the UC-San Francisco says, "At my own medical center we have banned pharmaceutical reps from coming because we don't think they are a good source of information. You don't ask the barber if you need a haircut."Pharma companies have a dubious history of breaking the rules governing off-label promotion. Over the past 10 years, 17 firms have paid more than $16B in settlements related to inappropriate off-label selling.Further complicating matters is the fact that up to 75% of published pre-clinical trial results cannot be reproduced in later studies.ETFs: IBB, BIB, IRY, BIS, IXJ, DRGS Related tickers: (MRK +0.4%)(LLY -0.1%)(PFE +0.3%)(BMY +0.7%)(GSK -4.1%)(OTCQX:RHHBY -1.1%)(SNY -0.6%)(OTCPK:BAYRY -0.5%)(NVS +0.1%)(AZN -0.3%)(JNJ +0.2%)(ABT -0.1%)(ABBV +0.1%) May 7, 2015, 11:13 AM | 6 Comments

Alkermes antipsychotic drug shows durable efficacy and beneficial weight effect in clinical trial
A six-month Phase 2 study evaluating Alkermes' (NASDAQ:ALKS) investigational oral atypical antipsychotic drug candidate, ALKS 3831, showed a durable efficacy compared to olanzapine as well as favorable effects on weight gain compared to olanzapine.The trial was conducted in two stages. In the initial three months, patients were randomized to receive either olanzapine or one of three doses of ALKS 3831. Antipsychotic efficacy and weight gain were assessed. Positive top-line data were reported in January. For the second three-month stage, patients receiving olanzapine were switched to ALKS 3831 while those already on ALKS 3831 continued therapy. Data from the second stage showed that switching from olanzapine for ALKS 3831 stopped mean weight gain.ALKS 3831 demonstrated equivalent efficacy to olanzapine in patients receiving ALKS 3831 for the entire six-month period as measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores while the mean percent change in body weight from Week 12 to Week 24 was only 0.5%. The mean change in body weight in patients receiving olanzapine during the first three months was 4.3% but only changed 0.1% during the subsequent three months after transitioning to ALKS 3831.Alkermes intends to submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. It plans to advance ALKS 3831 to Phase 3 development later this year.Olanzapine, sold under the brand name Zyprexa, generated more than $1B in sales for manufacturer Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) the past four quarters.Previously: Alkermes antipsychotic successful minimizing weight gain in Phase 2 study (Jan. 7) Apr. 6, 2015, 8:47 AM
Takeda Pharma offers $2.2B to settle Actos cases
In an effort to avoid any more large verdicts against it, Takeda Pharmaceutical (OTCPK:TKPHF) (OTCPK:TKPYY) offers to pay more than $2.2B to settle 8,000+ lawsuits accusing the company of hiding the cancer risks of its Actos diabetes drug. Patients allege the company ignored/downplayed the cancer risks of Actos prior to its launch in 1999 and misled regulators about the drug's risks. The deal would amount to a payment of ~$275K per case and would bring the three-year litigation fight to an end. Its offer pertains only to patients who have already sued or who have already hired a lawyer to file a suit.A jury award in a Louisiana federal court last year provided substantial motivation for Takeda to settle the cases. A shopkeeper who blamed Actos for causing his bladder cancer was awarded $9B, later reduced to $36.8M by the judge.Unsurprisingly, some attorneys feel that $2.2B falls short of adequate compensation to the patients who developed bladder cancer after taking Actos. More than 3,500 cases have been consolidated under U.S. District Court judge Rebecca Doherty in Lafayette, LA. Another 4,500 cases are pending in four other states.Actos sales peaked in the year ended March 2011 at $4.5B, representing 27% of Takeda's revenue. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) was Takeda's commercial partner beginning in 1999, but the partnership ended in 2006 with Lilly retaining the rights to Actos in parts of Asia and Europe and in Canada and Mexico. Lilly says Takeda agreed to cover all legal costs regarding Actos sales in the U.S. Apr. 1, 2015, 7:31 AM | 1 Comment
European Ad Comm recommends approval of combo pill for type 2 diabetes

Sanofi plans to launch new long-acting insulin in U.S. on Monday
According to a source close to the matter, Sanofi (SNY +2.2%) intends to launch its long-acting insulin, Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 IU/mL), in the U.S. on Monday, which is consistent with its earlier statement that it planned to launch at the beginning of Q2.Toujeo, approved by the FDA on February 25, is a once-daily injection of basal insulin that has three times more insulin per mL than its top-selling Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] 100 IU/mL).Sanofi will have the long-acting insulin market to itself for a while. Novo Nordisk (NVO +0.9%) plans to resubmit its NDA for its offering, Tresiba (insulin degludec), shortly, but approval won't happen until next year at the earliest. Eli Lilly (LLY +0.2%) postponed its NDA for basal insulin peglispro until "after 2016" so it can assess its effects on the liver.Previously: Novo Nordisk trys again with Tresiba and Ryzodeg NDA resubmission to FDA (March 26)Previously: Side effect of Lilly basal insulin potentially delays regulatory filings past 2016 (Feb. 23) Mar. 27, 2015, 11:48 AM

Pfizer to receive $200M payment from partner Eli Lilly upon resumption of pain med development
Pfizer (PFE +1.3%) and collaboration partner Eli Lilly (LLY +0.1%) plan to resume the Phase 3 clinical program for tanezumab for the treatment of chronic pain. The action will trigger a $200M payment from Lilly to Pfizer as stipulated in their agreement.The FDA instituted a partial clinical hold on tanezumab in December 2012 due to adverse changes in the sympathetic nervous system of mature animals. Studies in terminal cancer pain were allowed to proceed. The regulator lifted the partial hold after reviewing nonclinical data submitted in February 2015 characterizing the sympathetic nervous system response to tanezumab.Tanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits (binds to) nerve growth factor (NGF), a regulator of pain processing and sensitivity. Pfizer was developing it for the treatment of osteoarthritis a few years ago, but stopped amid indications that it was associated with joint destruction. The pain med worked so well that a group of patients blew out joints that needed replacing. Pfizer shelved the program in light of the safety risk but rekindled it after a panel of outside experts recommended that a more specific patient population could benefit from anti-NGF therapies. It partnered with Lilly in 2013 to advance the program and share the risk. Mar. 23, 2015, 9:35 AM | 3 Comments

More is better for insulin king Novo Nordisk
In an interview in London, Novo Nordisk (NVO -1.4%) deputy CEO Kaare Schultz, the heir apparent to current chief Lars Sorensen, said the company's focus on diabetes will likely grow from today's 79% to 80 - 90% in 10 years. "This is the key focus for the company and we see strength in staying focused."In addition to a new ultra-long-acting insulin, Novo has two GLP-1 offerings in the pipeline, a once-weekly injection and a first-ever GLP-1 pill. It is also experimenting with an oral insulin. GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists have a three-pronged mechanism of action to reduce blood sugar: they slow down the process of food leaving the stomach, hinder the liver from producing too much sugar and help the pancreas produce more insulin.Another bright spot is the strong growth of its daily GLP-1 Victoza (liraglutide) despite the presence of once-weekly offerings GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK +0.3%) Tanzeum (albiglutide) and Eli Lilly's (LLY -0.4%) Trulicity (dulaglutide).The company has exposure in hemophilia and some rare diseases but decided to exit the inflammatory diseases space last year.It plans to launch its obesity drug Saxenda (liraglutide [rDNA origin] injection) in the U.S. as early as next month using 500 of its 3,000-strong sales force. Peak sales could reach $1B+. Mar. 17, 2015, 1:11 PM | 7 Comments
German court rules against Lilly in patent case
The German Court of Appeal rules that Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) vitamin regimen patent for its cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed disodium) would not be infringed by a generic competitor that intends to market a dipotassium salt form of pemetrexed in Germany once the compound patent expires in December. The decision vacated the prior decision of the Regional Court of Dusseldorf in April of last year.Lilly SVP and General Counsel Michael J. Harrington says, "We strongly disagree with the ruling by the German Court of Appeal regarding Alimta's vitamin regimen patent. Although, Alimta's compound patent remains in force and is expected to provide exclusivity in Germany through December 2015, we continue to believe that Alimta's vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by the entry of generic pemetrexed products, including alternative salt forms, in Europe prior to June 2021. We will seek permission to appeal this ruling to the German Supreme Court."In April 2014, the English High Court made a similar ruling pertaining to alternative salt forms of pemetrexed in the U.K., Italy, France and Spain. The appeal of the decision in pending and is scheduled for hearing starting March 9.Lilly's vitamin regimen patent was upheld in a prior ruling by the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office. An appeal is pending before the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. Mar. 6, 2015, 9:00 AM
FDA imposes limits on testosterone drugs and labeling changes to warn of potential heart risks
Based on the findings of an independent advisory panel, the FDA issues a formal announcement that restricts testosterone drug makers from promoting their products for age-related low testosterone, an ever-increasing target of prescriptions. The number of men being prescribed testosterone jumped over 75% between 2009 and 2013.The agency asks (not really a request) manufacturers to change their labeling to clarify that their products are only approved for men with specific medical conditions and that taking the drugs could increase their risk of heart attacks and strokes.The agency also requests that manufacturers of approved products, including skin patches, solutions, intramuscular injections and topical gels, conduct studies to determine if their treatments increase cardiovascular risk.Last year, the FDA mandated that testosterone product makers update their labeling to include a warning about the risk of blood clots.Related tickers: (NYSE:ABBV) (NASDAQ:ENDP) (NYSE:LLY) (NASDAQ:ATRS) (NASDAQ:RPRX) (NASDAQ:LPCN) (NYSE:TEVA) (NASDAQ:AUXL) Mar. 4, 2015, 8:23 AM | 6 Comments
Potential Afrezza discounts and challenging competitive landscape behind Goldman downgrade of MannKind
As Ben Levisohn reports, Goldman Sachs analyst Jay Olson downgraded MannKind (MNKD -9.6%) after he revised his valuation model to include net discounts to Afrezza of 40% instead of 20% in light of the downward price pressure from payers to other diabetes product makers.He cites the recent launches of Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance (empagliflozin) tablets and Eli Lilly's (LLY -1%) Trulicity (dulaglutide injection) that came in 75% below his Q4 estimates. Afrezza's launch trajectory based on script data, albeit early stage, is also falling short of expectations.Mr. Olson has lowered his 2025 sales projection 50% for Afrezza to $1B from $2B and reduced EPS estimates from 2017 onward. He believes that MannKind will achieve the sales targets required to capture $925M in milestones from commercial partner Sanofi (SNY -0.1%), however.His $3 price target leaves a 50% downside from the current price.Previously: MannKind off 10% premarket on Goldman downgrade (March 3) Mar. 3, 2015, 11:46 AM | 64 Comments
FDA clears Sanofi long acting insulin
The FDA approves Sanofi's (NYSE:SNY) Toujeo (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection, 300 U/ml), a once-daily long-acting basal insulin, to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The company expects Toujeo to be available in the U.S. at the beginning of Q2.Sanofi's intent is to transition patients from its current once-daily basal insulin, Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection, 100 U/ml), which faces competition from generics, to the premium-priced Toujeo, although the company has yet to disclose the specific price.Toujeo will be available in a disposable prefilled pen that contains 450 units of insulin and requires only one third of the injection volume to deliver the same number of insulin units as Lantus. The maximum single injection of 80 IU meets the needs to the vast majority of diabetics on basal insulin.Lantus is the top-selling insulin in the world, pulling in $7.2B for Sanofi last year. Analysts say the conversion to Toujeo is far from certain, however. Payers may lack enthusiasm for paying more for the new product which is not that differentiated from the old.Toujeo's approval in Europe is pending.Related tickers: (NYSE:LLY) (NYSE:MRK) Feb. 26, 2015, 7:30 AM
Side effect of Lilly basal insulin potentially delays regulatory filings past 2016
Eli Lilly (LLY -1.1%) delays its planned regulatory applications to the FDA and European Medicines Agency for its basal insulin peglispro (BIL) in order to generate additional clinical data to further understand and characterize the potential effects of BIL treatment on liver fat that was observed in the Phase 3 trials.The length of the delay cannot be determined until a clinical trial plan has been completed, but the company believes its submissions are likely to occur after 2016. It is currently working with regulators on a path forward.The ongoing Phase 3 studies for the once-daily treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes will continue as planned. Approximately 3,900 patients have been treated with BIL to date with no observable drug-induced liver impairment or Hy's Law cases.Previously: Lilly basal insulin beats Lantus (Sept. 5, 2014) Feb. 23, 2015, 10:40 AM

Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and licensee Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) announce positive top-line results in a Phase 3 trial evaluating baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an inadequate response to, or were intolerant of, at least one conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (cDMARD). The study met its primary efficacy endpoint of an improved ACR20 score (the patient's RA improved by 20%) compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment.The companies reported successful top-line results from the first Phase 3 trial, RA-BEACON, in December. They plan to present results from both studies at scientific meetings this year.Baricitinib is a once-daily, oral, selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor. JAK-dependent cytokines play a significant role in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.Incyte and Lilly entered into an exclusive global license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds in December 2009. The firms are conducting four Phase 3 trials in RA to support regulatory submissions in most countries. They recently initiated a fifth to support clinical development in China. Four of the five studies will be completed this year.Baricitinib is in Phase 2 development for the treatment of psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy.Previously: Primary endpoint achieved in baricitinib Phase 3 (Dec. 9, 2014) Feb. 23, 2015, 8:25 AM
Lilly extends evacetrapib Phase 3 six months
On the recommendation of the academic executive committee, Eli Lilly (LLY +0.1%) extends the Phase 3 study of evacetrapib by ~six months. Results remain blinded to both the company and academic committee so the extension is not based on data, but the belief that longer treatment will allow appropriate testing of the hypothesis that evacetrapib added to statins can reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to statins alone in patients with high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).The futility analysis, previously planned for this quarter, will now occur in Q3.Evacetrapib is cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor which increases high-density lipoprotein and lowers low-density lipoprotein.Pfizer (PFE -0.5%) attempted to develop its own CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, but abandoned it in 2006 after Phase 3 studies showed excessive all-cause mortality.

Makers of pricey drugs working on new payment model
Facing ever-increasing pushback from payers over the high price of new treatments, some biotech firms are working on a new payment model that rewards them for the long-term performance of their drugs. Gene therapy developers, including BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN +0.4%) and Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO -0.1%), are leading the effort.The industry says that a one-time cure, even if priced greater than $1M, saves money over the long term but acknowledges that payers will balk at paying the cost upfront. The general consensus is that an upfront payment over $1M will be unacceptable.Under a pay-for-performance scheme, the annuity-like payments would cease if medical testing showed that the therapy was not working. Much work remains to be done, though, before this approach could be implemented. For example, legislation may be required to force insurers to pick up the tab for patients that switch coverage.Some proponents of the new scheme say that the payment streams could be securitized and sold to investors, like consumer debt.Gene therapies represent the highest priced treatments. Only one has cleared the regulatory hurdle to date, UniQure's (QURE +1.5%) Glybera, which costs 850K euros ($1M) in Germany. It will be sold for a one-time payment because it is too difficult to measure how well it works (this reasoning will undoubtedly pop up again).Previously: UniQure sets price record with Glybera (Nov. 26, 2014)Related tickers: (CELG +1.3%)(AMGN -0.2%)(BIIB +0.5%)(GILD +0.1%)(MRK -0.3%)(GSK -0.2%)(AZN +0.9%)(LLY +0.3%)(NVS +0.1%)(PFE -0.5%)(JNJ -0.3%)(OTCQX:RHHBY +1.4%)(BMY -0.4%)(ABT)(BAX -1.1%) Feb. 19, 2015, 10:10 AM | 32 Comments

Express Scripts is Biotech's Grinch
Express Scripts' (NASDAQ:ESRX) success in containing the prices of new HCV therapies by pitting Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) against AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is sending shock waves through the biotech/pharma industry. Most of the big players slumped yesterday as investors fear that ESRX's tactics will spread to other high cost areas like cancer and cholesterol.At JPM15 yesterday, CEO George Paz said that the new cholesterol-lowering post-statin PCSK9 inhibitors will be the next big opportunity to pit drug firms against each other in order to drive costs down. FDA clearance of the first two therapies, one from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and the other from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) (NYSE:SNY), is expected to occur at about the same time.The prices of emerging cancer therapies will also be in payers' crosshairs. Amgen's Blincyto, for example, costs $178,000 per standard course of treatment while Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda is close behind at $150,000.Related tickers: (NYSE:AZN) (NYSE:GSK) (NYSE:LLY) (ABBV) (NYSE:PFE) (NASDAQ:BIIB) (NYSE:ABT) (NASDAQ:CELG) (NYSE:BMY) (OTCQX:RHHBY) (NYSE:JNJ) (NYSE:NVS) (OTCPK:BAYRY) Jan. 14, 2015, 9:13 AM | 56 Comments

Drug makers face pushback on pricey meds
Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) is at the forefront of an increasing wave of resistance to the high prices of new drugs from pharma and biotech firms, some which cost as much as $50K per month. Pharmaceutical spending in the U.S. is $270B and may breach $500B in five years. ESRX's method of controlling costs is to refuse to pay for them. For 2015, for example, it is excluding 66 branded drugs from its main formulary, an increase of 18 from 2014's 48. On the list is Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) rheumatoid arthritis drug Simponi (golimumab) which costs $3K per month.Other prescription benefits managers are employing similar tactics. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) will exclude 95 drugs from its 2015 formulary including Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) multiple sclerosis med Rebif (interferon beta-1a) which costs $5K for a four-week supply.Governments are pushing back as well. Among 42 state Medicaid programs, 27 pay for Gilead Sciences' HCV med Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) only for patients with severe liver damage while others impose coverage limitations for patients with recent substance-abuse problems. In the U.S., the full regimen cost is $84K. Recently, Britain's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) balked at recommending reimbursement for Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) blood cancer drug Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab).Ninety percent of commercial health plans require pre-approval of specialty drugs, up from 82% in 2011.Previously: Roche's Gazyvaro not NICE in the UK Previously: Global drug tab will breach trillion dollar mark this year ETFs: IBB, BIB, IRY, BIS, IXJ, DRGS Related tickers: (NYSE:NVS) (NYSE:AZN) (NASDAQ:AMGN) (NASDAQ:BIIB) (NASDAQ:CELG) (NYSE:LLY) (NYSE:SNY) (NYSE:ABT) (NYSE:ABBV) (NYSE:BMY) (NYSE:MRK) (NYSE:GSK) Nov. 25, 2014, 8:18 AM | 24 Comments
FDA reviewing long-term death risk of antiplatelet therapies
FDA says it's evaluating preliminary data from a clinical trial showing that 30-month treatment with dual antiplatelet blood-thinning therapy decreased the risk of heart attacks and clot formation in stents, but there was an increased overall risk of death compared to 12 months of treatment.The clinical trial compared 30 months vs. 12 months of treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin plus either clopidogrel (Plavix (NYSE:BMY)) or prasugrel (Effient (NYSE:LLY)), following implantation of drug-eluting coronary stents.The higher rate of death was largely explained by an increase in deaths from non-cardiovascular causes, primarily cancer and trauma deaths. The increased risk of death with longer treatment was seen in the patients given clopidogrel, but not those given prasugrel.Increases in non-cardiovascular death have not been reported in previous clopidogrel trials for other cardiovascular diseases.FDA still sees benefits of Plavix and Effient outweighing their potential risks, and recommends doctors "should not change the way they prescribe these drugs at this time."Also see: NEJM Nov. 16, 2014, 5:08 PM

Virobay on deck for IPO
Menlo Park, CA-based Virobay (VBAY) is set for its IPO of 3.8M shares at $12 - 14.The clinical stage biopharmaceutical firm develops drugs based on its cysteine cathepsin platform. Cysteine cathepsins are important enzymes in the biology of many diseases. The company believes that inhibiting these enzymes produces safer, more effective therapies. It currently focuses its efforts on inhibitors of cathepsins S and B.Its lead product candidates are cathepsin S inhibitors: VBY-036 for neuropathic pain and Crohn's disease and VBY-891 for psoriasis.

LPCN 1021 hits primary endpoint in Phase 3 trial
Lipocine's (LPCN +40.8%) oral testosterone replacement therapy candidate, LPCN 1021, achieves its primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase 3 clinical trial.The FDA guidelines for primary efficacy success stipulate a minimum of 75% of trial subjects on active treatment achieve a serum testosterone concentration within the normal range of 300-1140 ng/dL and the lower bound of the 95% CI (confidence interval) must be greater than 65%.In the Phase 3 study, 88% of LPCN 1021-treated patients achieved testosterone levels in the normal range with a lower bound CI of 82%.LPCN 1021's safety profile was acceptable as well. Three percent of the subjects reported a serious adverse event, though none were drug-related. All drug-related adverse events were mild or moderate. The safety extension phase of the trial is ongoing.One aspect of the value proposition of oral TRT therapy is the elimination of the risk of inadvertent testosterone transfer associated with transdermal gels (before the gel dries).Related tickers: (LLY +0.6%)(ABBV +1.1%)(RPRX +8.1%)(AUXL -0.2%)(TEVA +0.4%) Sep. 24, 2014, 10:52 AM | 2 Comments
Plandai firms up plans to develop horny goat weed extract
Plandai Biotechnology (OTCQB:PLPL -3%) plans to develop and test an all-natural product for erectile dysfunction (ED). The compound, called icariin, is an extract from the plant Epimedium, also called the horny goat weed. Icariin is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor similar to sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra.The company has begun cultivating and cloning epimedium and expects to begin testing on a potential ED product in mid-2015. Icariin is less potent than sildenafil, but Plandai believes its extraction process will enhance epimedium's absorption and retention in the bloodstream to a sufficient degree that it will be a viable all-natural ED treatment alternative.Related tickers: (PFE -0.7%) (LLY -0.5%) (GSK +0.4%) (OTCPK:BAYRY +0.9%)(AUXL -0.7%) Sep. 22, 2014, 10:47 AM | 5 Comments

Ad Comm says TRT drug makers should conduct new trials to assess heart risk
In a joint meeting between the Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee, panel members vote 20-1 in favor of drug developers' need to further assess the cardiovascular risks of testosterone products. Sixteen voted that it should be studied only in certain situations.Members also voted 20-1 in favor of a revision of who should be prescribed the drugs. The panel says there is little evidence that testosterone replacement therapies (TRT) are effective for treating low levels of hormone caused by aging.Prescriptions for TRT products almost doubled from 2010 to 2013. About 20% of TRT patients do not have laboratory evidence that they need the therapy.Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) says that current evidence does not support a causal link between TRT and cardiovascular events. Based on the committee's statements, though, it will work with the FDA on how to communicate the cardiovascular risk to patients.The committees meet today to discuss Clarus Therapeutics' NDA for an oral testosterone.Related tickers: (NYSE:ABBV) (NASDAQ:AUXL) (NYSE:TEVA) Sep. 18, 2014, 7:40 AM

Lilly basal insulin beats Lantus
In two Phase 3 clinical trials, Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) basal insulin peglispro (BIL) demonstrated a statistically significant lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to Sanofi's (NYSE:SNY) Lantus (insulin glargine) at 26 and 52 weeks in patients with Type 1 diabetes.Both trials showed the rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly lower in patients taking BIL than those taking insulin glargine. In the open-label IMAGINE-1 trial, patients taking BIL reported a statistically significant higher rate of severe hypoglycemic events, however. In the the larger blinded IMAGINE-3 trial, the rate of severe hypoglycemic events in patients taking BIL was numerically lower that the insulin glargine arm but it was not statistically significant.Both trials showed a statistically significant difference in weight. The BIL cohort experienced weight loss with lower HbA1c compared to weight gain in the insulin glargine cohort.In IMAGINE-3, the BIL cohort showed statistically significant changes compared to insulin glargine in certain parameters: an increase in triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, a decrease in HDL cholesterol and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Some of these changes were not observed in IMAGINE-1.Lilly intends to submit its marketing application with regulators in Q1 2015. Sep. 5, 2014, 8:11 AM | 3 Comments

Lilly and Canadian government spar over drug patents
Many industry observers are watching the IP-related dispute between Eli Lilly (LLY -0.4%) and the Canadian government. Several years ago, Canadian courts invalidated Lilly's patents on its ADHD drug Strattera (atomoxetine HCL) and its antipsychotic Zyprexa (olanzapine) thereby opening the market for generic competitors. The company filed for arbitration last fall under the rules of NAFTA seeking $500M in damages. It hopes to force Canada to alter the way it administers patent rights.Lilly asserts that the Canadian courts erred in ruling that it should have offered more proof of effectiveness at the time of the initial filings. It says that the courts relied on a government doctrine that produced absurd results and accuses the government of expropriating its IP.The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development issued a 45-page rebuke on June 30 asserting that Lilly's argument is full of misstatements and offers a misleading account of the facts. It claims that the firm is a "disappointed litigant" that refuses to accept "reasoned, principled and procedurally just court decisions."The notion of a "supranational court of appeals" alarms consumer advocacy groups because of the potential ability of companies to circumvent domestic laws and courts.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has yet to weigh in on the matter.

Data analysis finds cognitive deficits precede functional deficits in Alzheimer's
A dataset analysis by researchers at Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) evaluating the relationship between cognitive and functional impairment in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease finds that cognitive declines predict subsequent functional deficits. The finding is consistent with current scientific theory.The challenge for drug developers is that for potential treatments that target the underlying neuropathology of the disease, effects on function may take longer to observe in clinical trials. Currently available scales were not developed to assess subtle functional changes or treatment effects on these deficits in patients with mild Alzheimer's. There is also debate over the degree of variability in the scales globally. Lilly researchers support debate on alternative ways to measure these parameters.In their analysis of placebo data from two clinical trials, researchers found that cognitive impairment significantly predicted functional impairment in five out of six time points. When they tested the opposite hypothesis, functional scores predicted cognitive outcomes in only one out of six time points. Jul. 15, 2014, 7:23 AM
Sanofi sues Lilly over insulin patents
In an attempt to halt Lilly's (LLY -0.7%) U.S. commercial launch of Abasria, a direct competitor to its top-selling Lantus, Sanofi (SNY -0.7%) files a patent infringement suit in the U.S. District Court of Delaware. It accuses Lilly of violating seven patents related to insulin and the devices used to deliver it.Lantus is the world's number one insulin generating $7.8B in sales last year. It will come off patent in February 2015. The filing of Sanofi's original lawsuit triggered the automatic 30-month stay of an FDA decision so Lilly's drug will not be on the market until at least mid-2016.Europe's CMHP issued a positive opinion on Lilly's Abasria MAA on June 27.

Positive Phase 3 results for once-weekly dulaglutide
Eli Lilly's (LLY -0.1%) once-weekly type 2 diabetes drug, the investigational glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonist dulaglutide, demonstrates superior reductions in HbA1c compared to insulin glargine with a lower risk of hypoglycemia.In the Award-2 Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of once-weekly dulaglutide compared to insulin glargine as an add-on to combination therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin, dulaglutide showed superior glucose control at 52 and 78 weeks. Also, significantly more dulaglutide-treated patients achieved HbA1c levels of <7%.In the Award-4 Phase 3 trial, once-weekly dulaglutide combined with prandial insulin lispro provided superior glucose control at 26 and 52 weeks compared to the traditional basal/bolus combination of insulin glargine and prandial insulin lispro. At the 26-week primary endpoint, significantly more dulaglutide-treated patients reached HbA1c levels of <7%.Hypoglycemia rates were lower in the dulaglutide groups in both studies.

Lilly cancer immunotherapeutic improves overall survival
In a Phase 3 trial, Eli Lilly's (LLY -0.6%) Cyramza (ramucirumab) in combination with chemotherapy extended overall survival (OS) in patients with second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study compared Cyramza plus docetaxel to placebo plus docetaxel in NSCLC patients with progression after platinum-based chemotherapy for locally-advanced or metastatic disease. The primary endpoint was OS while the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).Patients in the Cyramza plus docetaxel arm (n=628) achieved a median OS of 10.5 months compared to 9.1 months for patients in the placebo plus docetaxel arm with a OS hazard ratio of 0.86, meaning there was a 14% reduction in risk of death.Median PFS was 4.5 months in the Cyramza cohort and 3.0 months in the placebo group with a PFS hazard ratio of 0.76, meaning there was a 24% reduction in the risk of progression or death.ORR was 23% in the Cyramza cohort and 14% in the placebo group.The company plans to submit its application to regulatory authorities in 2H 2014.

Lilly and partner file for diabetes drug
The FDA accepts the NDA filed by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly (LLY) for the combo tablet of empagliflozin and Tradjenta (linagliptin) for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in adults.The product offers the mechanisms of a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor in a single tablet.SGLT2 inhibitors remove excess glucose through the urine by blocking its re-absorption in the kidney. DPP-4 inhibitors work by increasing hormones that stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin and stimulate the liver to produce less glucose. Apr. 14, 2014, 9:20 AM
French plan to allow generics alarms Big Pharma
In its recent healthcare budget, French lawmakers introduced a measure that will allow pharmacists to substitute generics for prescribed brand-name biotech drugs. This has rattled the industry since France is Europe's #2 pharmaceutical market behind Germany.A decree must be passed before it becomes effective.France is the first European country to pursue biologic substitution. Big Pharma fears a domino effect if it is successful despite the heretofore slow uptake of biosimilars.The initiative applies only to patients starting a new course of treatment. Doctors will still retain the ability to demand the branded product.Unsurprisingly, Big Pharma is upset at not being consulted prior to the law's passage.Some analysts believe France could save up to $1.4B by 2020 by using generics.Substitutions only apply to retail pharmacies. 40% of biotech prescriptions are filled in hospitals.(RHHBY) (AMGN) (NVS) (SNY) (LLY) (PFE) (BMY) (MRK) (GSK) (JNJ) (HSP) (ABBV) (AZN) (BAYRY) Apr. 10, 2014, 9:32 AM | 12 Comments
Jury smacks Takeda, Eli Lilly with $9B verdict over Actos drug
A jury has ordered Japan's Takeda (TKPYY) to pay $6B and Eli Lilly (LLY) $3B in punitive damages over allegations that they hid the cancer risks associated with the diabetes therapy Actos.However, Eli Lilly could be off the hook, as Takeda agreed to indemnify Lilly for any legal liability connected to Actos.In addition, the award is likely to be cut on appeal, as the Supreme Court has set limits on punitive verdicts.In two previous cases, judges quashed multi-million dollar awards against Actos.Notwithstanding, Takeda's shares slumped 5.2% in Tokyo.

Eli Lilly breast-cancer drug helped almost 2/3 patients in trial
Eli Lilly's (LLY) Bemaciclib drug aided 61% of participants in a Phase I trial of 132 patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer.The size of tumors shrunk by 30% or didn't increase for 24 weeks.Progression-free survival was 9.1 months.Like Pfizer's Palbociclib, which performed well in a Phase II study, Bemaciclib is part of a new class of drug called CDK 4/6 inhibitors. These treatments limit the activity of two enzymes involved in cell division — cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. Apr. 7, 2014, 7:49 AM
Zilmax study may involve 240,000 cattle
Merck (MRK +0.4%) wants to feed its controversial additive to almost a quarter of a million cattle to prove it is safe. The only glitch is that major meat processors lack enthusiasm for animals fed with the drug.Feedlot owners are glad to participate if they have assurances from the slaughterhouses that they will buy the animals.The company intends to sign up 5 to 15 feedlots per slaughterhouse that agrees to process the cattle.Raising a few eyebrows is Merck's silence regarding the identity of the study's lead investigator. Some observers perceive that its lack of disclosure implies the study's outcome is a foregone conclusion.Since the firm pulled Zilmax in August, many feedlots have switched to ractopamine-based Optaflexx made by Eli Lilly's (LLY +0.6%) Elanco Animal Health Unit.

China still bright for Big Pharma
Last summer's dust up between GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Chinese regulators over accusations of corruption has quietly subsided. Drug firms perceive the China market has returned to its "business as unusual." Glaxo responded to the matter by replacing its sales targets for individual reps with broader performance-rating criteria such as improved patient care.Although far from assured, other members of Big Pharma don't expect the authorities to rattle their sabers again any time soon.Analysts expect the nation's drug market to continue its annual 15% growth rate and emerge as the globe's second largest pharmaceutical market behind the U.S. by 2016 on the basis of $165B in sales.(SNY) (LLY) (NVS) (AZN) (PFE) (BMY) (JNJ) (BAYRY) (RHHBY) (NVO) (ABBV) Apr. 2, 2014, 11:30 AM | 3 Comments

Lilly drug gets positive opinion from CHMP
The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommends approval for Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly's (LLY) empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetics.The positive opinion is based on clinical trials involving more than 13,000 adults with type 2 diabetes.The European Commission usually issues a legally binding decision withing 3 months of a CHMP opinion. Like the US, it typically follows the Committee's view.Recently, the US FDA delayed its approval of the drug due to manufacturing deficiencies at Boehringer Ingelheim. Mar. 21, 2014, 8:56 AM

Lilly diabetes drug Dulaglutide comparable to market leader
Eli Lilly's (LLY) once-a-week Dulaglutide treatment for Type 2 diabetes was comparable to Novo Nordisk's (NVO) once-daily Victoza in cutting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) - a measure of blood-sugar control - in a trial of almost 600 patients.The study's main goal was to show that Dulaglutide was "non-inferior" to Victoza, which is the market leader. However, Dulaglutide wasn't superior.Still, Ely Lilly hopes that Dulaglutide will have a competitive advantage because it only needs to be administered once a week.The drug is particularly important, as Eli Lilly has gone five years without a major approval while at the same time suffering from patent expirations.ISI Group estimates that Dulaglutide could generate peak annual revenue of $2B vs Victoza's 2013 sales of $2.1B. Other rival drugs include AstraZeneca's (AZN) Byetta and Bydureon. (PR) Feb. 25, 2014, 9:20 AM

Novartis reportedly draws interest for vaccines business, could fetch $1B
Novartis (NVS -0.7%) reportedly is drawing interest for its human vaccines unit as talks to swap its animal health business for assets from Merck (MRK +2.6%) slow down.While the vaccines unit was initially on the table with animal health as part of the possible trade for MRK’s over-the-counter drugs business, NVS may now sell the vaccines unit separately in a deal that could be valued at ~$1B.NVS and MRK are still talking but agreeing on valuation is proving difficult, so NVS has informally talked to Eli Lilly (LLY -0.1%) and Bayer (BAYRY, BAYZF) about the animal health business, according to the report.

Sanofi sues Eli Lilly over Lantus patent breach
Sanofi (SNY) has sued Eli Lilly (LLY) over the alleged infringement of patents related to the French company's top-selling Lantus diabetes treatment.Sanofi's action comes a month after Lilly filed for FDA approval to sell a biosimilar version of Lantus and questioned the validity of several of its patents.Sanofi's suit has triggered an automatic 30-month stay of approval by the FDA, which means Lilly won't be able to market its biosimilar drug until mid-2016, over a year later than previously expected.Lantus generates worldwide revenue of $7B but is due to lose patent protection in the U.S. in February 2015.Sanofi's shares were -1.7% premarket, while those of Novo Nordisk (NVO), another major provider of insulin products, were +3.3%.

Jefferies downgrades Merck, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca
Jefferies is out with a few Big Pharma downgrades.AstraZeneca (AZN) is cut to Underperform from Hold on "poor base business fundamentals" and an "unlikely" Brilinta turnaround. The stock is now Jefferies' "least preferred European stock."Eli Lilly (LLY) is downgraded to Underperform from Hold on "further R&D disappointment in its pipeline as well as the increased strain this will put on future cash flow allocation required to maintain the dividend." Price target cut to $40 from $49.Merck (MRK) is cut to Hold from Buy as Jefferies says the magnitude of share repurchases and cost-savings was "less than hoped for." Although MRK may "divest or JV either (or both) its Consumer or Animal Health units, this alone is not reason enough ... to leave the shares on a Buy rating ... considering the pressures on Januvia growth [and] poor R&D productivity."

Merck KGaA sees bright future for Erbitux
"We still have room to grow in colorectal cancer," Merck KGaA's (MKGAF.PK) head of prescription drugs says, regarding the prospects for Erbitux, the company's first-line treatment for wild-type colorectal cancer.Results showing the drug extends the lives of patients longer than Roche's (RHHBY.OB -1.6%) Avastin (median survival 33.1 months versus 25.6 months) should help German Merck's marketing team "make the case for the drug," Reuters notes and may improve the product's long-term prospects.As for a perceived biosimilar threat (projected as early as 2015), the company says it does "not expect to see a biosimilar for Erbitux for quite a few years." Merck has rights to Erbitux outside North America where Eli Lilly (LLY -0.7%) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY +1.5%) sell the drug. Oct. 4, 2013, 1:17 PM
FDA approves menopause treatment from Pfizer, Ligand
The FDA approves Pfizer's (PFE) Duavee for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hot flashes and for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis.PFE partner Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) got a big boost from the news Thursday, rising 7%.Notably, the drug is a selective estrogen receptor modulator combined with conjugated estrogens. Premarin is a conjugated estrogen tablet and made the news earlier this week after new research suggested there may be a link between the drug and the risk of blood clots.Another FDA-approved post-menopausal osteoporosis drug is Eli Lilly's (LLY) Evista.

Eli Lilly reaffirms outlook, talks buybacks, challenges
Eli Lilly (LLY) plans to "return the company to revenue growth and expanding margins after 2014," the company's top brass says.LLY is also reaffirming its near-term revenue, net income, and operating cash flow goals, saying it expects $20B in sales, $3B in net income, and $4B in cash flow through the end of next year.Also announced is a new $5B buyback.The company also reminds investors that this year has seen "a record seven regulatory submissions of four molecules."The stock is off around 1% in premarket trading however, likely due to the company's use of the word "challenging" to describe its chances of hitting the $20B revenue goal.

Eli Lilly's ramucirumab miss costly: Goldman
As expected, the Street is out negative on Eli Lilly's (LLY -3.3%) ramucirumab, as positive results in gastric cancer aren't enough to make up for the breast cancer miss.
"Breast cancer would have been a significant commercial opportunity," Goldman's Jami Rubin says, adding that although "gastric cancer is an area with significant unmet medical need," the ROSE miss may ultimately cost the company dearly on top line.Goldman now sees 2018 ramucirumab sales of $420M versus $1.7B previously. Price target lowered to $54 from $56.

Eli Lilly cancer drug succeeds in gastric cancer trial, falls short in breast cancer
Eli Lilly's (LLY) ramucirumab — which the company gained access to in 2008 with the $6.5B ImClone deal — meets its primary endpoint of extending both overall survival and progression-free survival in a Phase 3 trial enrolling patients with advanced gastric cancer.The RAINBOW trial (which combined ramucirumab and paclitaxel) results follow similarly encouraging results from the single-agent trial REGARD.However, LLY says ramucirumab did not meet its primary endpoint in ROSE, a Phase 3 study in women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and that appears to be what investors are focusing on.

Repros Therapeutics: Not so fast, says Feuerstein
One of today's big movers is Repros Therapeutics (RPRX +11.3%), as fresh data on Androxal has the stock on a tear.If you follow healthcare stocks closely, you know you can often look for the bear thesis from theStreet's Adam Feuerstein — today's RPRX rally is no exception.Among the things Feuerstein wants to know: 1) "What was the rate of testosterone normalization for men treated with placebo?" 2) "What were the baseline and end-of-treatment levels of testosterone for patients in both arms of the study?", and 3) "Was the testosterone normalization endpoint reached with statistical significance?"Other concerns include an apparently non-committal stance on whether the sperm-count endpoint was met and the prospect of a "messy challenge" to Androxal's patents (more on this here).Companies who market "low T" treatments include ABBV, AUXL, and LLY Sep. 17, 2013, 1:47 PM | 6 Comments

Eli Lilly benefits from Merk's suspension of Zilmax sales
Eli Lilly's (LLY) Elanco Animal Health unit appears to be benefiting from Merck's (MRK) decision to halt sales of its Zilmax cattle feed additive due to health concerns, with Elanco so inundated with demand for its Optaflexx product that it's telling some new customers that it's unable to supply them immediately.Elanco denies that it's unable to meet the demand.Meanwhile, livestock expert John Nalivka doesn't believe that the tight supply of the additives will have a major impact on beef production. "We're not going to run out of beef," Nalivka says. Aug. 26, 2013, 7:43 AM
Eli Lilly joins list of those accused of bribery in China
Eli Lilly (LLY) has become the latest multi-national pharmaceutical company to be accused of corruption in China, with the country's 21st Century Business Herald newspaper quoting a former senior manager who said that the firm spent over 30M yuan ($4.90M) from 2011-2012 in bribing doctors to prescribe the firm's treatments.Illegal payments at Eli Lilly's Chinese business are widespread, the ex-manager said.Earlier this month, the company said it was visited by officials from the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC) as part of a "routine" business inspection. The visit was not related to the probe into corruption at GSK, Eli Lilly said.Novartis and Sanofi are also under investigation for possible bribery. Aug. 22, 2013, 4:05 AM
Likely outcome unclear in unique Lilly drug patent case
"The significant scientific research ... performed in support of the vitamin dosage regimen patent deserves intellectual property protection," Eli Lilly (LLY) says, as the company begins its defense of an Altima patent covering the administration of the lung cancer drug with folic acid and vitamin B12.Although Teva (TEVA -0.5%) is the odds-on favorite to prevail in the patent dispute being heard by a federal court in Indianapolis, some say the outcome is not at all clear due to the unusual nature of LLY's defense."This is the first time I've heard of a company going down this route to defend a patent, by adding nutrients," one healthcare strategist tells Reuters. 
The stakes are high for LLY: Five extra years of patent protection means a lot when the drug at issue is a $2.6B per year blockbuster. Aug. 19, 2013, 1:42 PM | 1 Comment
Eli Lilly readies critical Alimta patent defense
It's a big week for pharmaceutical heavyweight Eli Lilly (LLY), as the company seeks to protect a patent on its blockbuster lung cancer treatment Alimta which accounted for around 11% of total revenue in 2012.At issue is a patent covering the administration of Alimta in conjunction with folic acid and vitamin B12, an innovation the company claims may have saved the drug after a "string of drug-related deaths" imperiled its regulatory future.Teva (TEVA) and others claim the addition of the vitamins was no innovation at all and that " a person of ordinary skill in oncology" would have concluded that the drug should be administered with the vitamin regime. As WSJ notes, "a court can deem a patent invalid if its claims are 'obvious' and anticipated by previous research."The difference in a LLY win or loss is five additional years of patent exclusivity.In the MRQ, Alimta brought in $669M in revenue.

Here's a quixotic twist: It appears that battling certain types cancer may lower the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, new research suggests. After pouring over data, investigators have concluded that most kinds of cancer - with the exception of prostate cancer - seem to confer some degree of protection against Alzheimer's, reducing risk of the age-related brain disorder by anywhere from 9% to 51%. They've also linked a common form of cancer treatment, chemotherapy, to a lower risk for developing Alzheimer's-related dementia.

Merck (MRK -1.3%) gets no love today from the FDA's approval of Liptruxet late Friday, as the stock is likely dragged down with the rest of the big pharma names on the back of a CNBC report that criticizes their earnings so far. The article points to the fact that pharmaceutical companies have seen a 4.7% contraction in earnings, and a 3.2% drop in revenue this quarter. Why? Morningstar's Damien Cover says there are two primary reasons: FX impact, especially from the yen, and intensified generic competition from patent losses.
