Halliburton has plenty of reasons to seek Aker Solutions, analyst says
Reports that Halliburton (HAL -2.2%) is near a deal to buy Aker Solutions are dismissed by Aker ASA, RBC analyst Kurt Hallead sees some compelling reasons why HAL might be interested in the Norwegian oil services company.Aker would give HAL a similar product suite as chief competitors Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) and Baker Hughes (BHI -0.3%)/General Electric (GE -1.2%), Hallead says, adding that a deal could make sense from a competitive framework but that HAL has never indicated that it felt subsea was a missing piece to its product and service offering.

GE's lagging performance not all Immelt's fault, J.P. Morgan analyst says
General Electric (GE -1.6%) is giving back most of its Friday gains that were sparked by a Fox Business report that CEO Jeffrey Immelt is "in the hot seat" with Nelson Peltz and his Trian Fund.GE shares have lagged the market for the past 15 years, advancing just 0.4% annually including reinvested dividends vs. a 7% return for the S&P 500, and Barclays discussed an unnamed investor’s view that the stock could gain 5% from a CEO change, along with various other reasons to like the stock.But J.P. Morgan's Stephen Tusa thinks the stock has struggled not because of execution or something the CEO has done wrong, but "because of the stubbornly low growth and secular challenges embedded in end markets where a company of this size is forced to play, as evidenced by limited profit growth despite $8B of restructuring and significant gains since 2012."Even so, Tusa prefers Danaher (DHR -0.6%), which "gets a multiple because it generates cash and redeploys into growth from a base of revenue that is 15% of what GE is, and recently even shrunk the portfolio to reset the growth trajectory."

GE reiterated Outperform at Credit Suisse, driven by power business
General Electric (GE -0.1%) is reiterated with an Outperform rating and $34 stock price target at Credit Suisse, which says the GE Power business is poised for a recovery despite the weak heavy duty gas turbine environment, as GE is taking advantage of its broader suite of products post-Alstom.Credit Suisse says the Power segment continues to be the main driver behind GE’s cash conversion improvement, and the unit has laid out a plan to improve its conversion by 15% this year.The firm also cites continued strong results in Renewables, with double-digit organic revenue and operating profit growth, and notes GE's sale of the Water business to Suez came in at a higher price and multiple than initial expectations.Although shares have been weak for the last 12 months, Credit Suisse thinks "the pro-cyclical cross-sector rotation has largely run its course, and GE is running out of shoes to drop."

GE’s Immelt sees pay package fall to $21.3M last year

GE's complicated accounting to blame for lagging performance, Bernstein says
General Electric GE has fallen 5.5% YTD year while the SPDR industrial sector ETF has gained 6%, all the more surprising given the potential benefit the company could enjoy from Pres. Trump’s economic plans if they get passed.Bernstein analysts blame GE’s accounting, which they say is designed to provide investors with more information but is needlessly complicated."If we were benevolent dictators... we would attempt to re-baseline, standardize, simplify and clean up all the financial reporting, taking a more conservative approach from goodwill to capital, contracts, pension and tax" at GE, Bernstein says.Even so, the firm maintains an Outperform rating and $38 price target for the stock, as it likes “GE’s cash and earnings growth prospects as it executes its transformation."

U.S. "diverging" from the world as trade leader, GE's Immelt warns
GE's Jeffrey Immelt warns in his annual letter to shareholders that the U.S. is "diverging" from the rest of the world and will be "less of a leader in trade."The CEO points to a "deep skepticism toward the ideas that have powered economic expansion of the industry for a generation, with concepts such as innovation, productivity and globalization being challenged and protectionism on the rise."“GE is a global company today and in the future,” even as it remains "a proud American company" that is creating jobs in the U.S., Immelt says; while GE’s sales have shifted from ~70% in the U.S. in 2000 to less than half today, the CEO says the company's $20B/year in exports keeps domestic factories churning.

Vestas vaults past GE to top spot in U.S. wind market
Vestas Wind Systems (OTCPK:VWDRY -1%) has jumped to the top of the U.S. wind turbine market, overtaking General Electric (GE +0.1%) in new capacity installed last year, according to the American Wind Energy Association.Vestas supplied 43% of the 8.2 GW of wind power capacity connected to the U.S. power grid in 2016, up from 33% in 2015 and just 12% in 2014, while GE's market share stood at 42% last year, down from well over half in 2014, although GE remains the market leader in terms of overall installed capacity in the U.S., the group says.But Vestas would lose its status as the world's top wind turbine maker when Siemens and Gamesa complete the merger of their wind assets.

Big exporters form coalition to support Republican border tax
Leading U.S. exporters launch a coalition in support of a House Republican plan for a "border adjustment" tax on all imports.The "American Made Coalition" includes more than 25 U.S. companies, including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL)."American workers and businesses are not competing today on a level playing field with foreign competitors because of an outdated and unfair tax system," says a spokesperson for the group.The group's launch underscores a division in corporate America over the proposal that would cut corporate income tax to 20% from 35%, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20% tax on imports.Retailers, oil refiners and foreign automakers have been lobbying against any big tax on imports, which they say would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products.

GE's Q4 disappoints but Immelt "pretty secure" about 2017 growth target
GE tumbled 2.2% in today's trade as Q4 revenue fell 2.4% Y/Y, with organic revenue in industrial businesses sliding 1% and coming in below the company's 0%-2% growth forecast and after having to reduce revenue forecasts throughout the year.Analysts question whether the Q4 results could mean GE will miss the 2017 target of 3%-5% growth that the company reaffirmed today, but with Alstom revenue included - as it will be in future quarters - hitting the revenue target "doesn't look like a stretch," says RBC analyst Deane Dray.Noting GE's overall organic revenue rose 4% in the quarter, CEO Jeffrey Immelt said in today's earnings conference call that felt "pretty secure" about the 2017 target.Q4 revenue in GE's oil and gas business sank 22%, but the decline was expected amid weak market conditions.GE’s Q4 industrial operating cash flow of $8.2B made it the "biggest cash quarter in our history,” Immelt said.Bloomberg's Brooke Sutherland writes hopefully that GE stands to benefit from tax reform and plans for infrastructure stimulus, and the stock's gains have not kept pace with the broader post-election rally, indicating some skepticism may have been baked in and leaving some room to rise.

Pentair, Roper upgraded at J.P. Morgan on Trump effect; GE a "top avoid"
Pentair (PNR +2.1%) and Roper Technologies (ROP +0.9%) are upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at J.P. Morgan, which believes the stocks have not received as much as credit as other electrical equipment and multi-industry stocks for anticipated Trump-related benefits.On PNR, given low expectations set in October and less stock appreciation due to an already low tax rate, the firm sees potential for relative upside to organic growth in a better economy and less downside in a sluggish/steady-state economy, all at an attractive discount.JPM downgrades TriMas (TRS +0.7%) to Neutral from Overweight, citing valuation following the stock's outperformance over the last three months; the firm also reiterates Honeywell (HON +0.5%), Ingersoll-Rand (IR +1%) and Danaher (DHR +0.3%) at Overweight, and Rockwell Automation (ROK +0.8%) at Underweight while naming General Electric (GE -0.2%) a "top avoid," expecting core operating performance to track below plan driven by weak fundamentals.

Alstom prevails in dispute with GE over $800M train signal contract
A U.S. district judge rules that Alstom may ask an independent accounting firm to resolve a dispute over the company's $800M purchase of General Electric's (NYSE:GE) train signaling business, rejecting GE's bid for arbitration.The judge said the "plain language" of the 2014 sales contract justified letting Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu handle the matter first, rather than arbitrators from the International Chamber of Commerce.Alstom had sued GE for breach of contract for refusing to let the accounting firm decide whether the purchase price should be adjusted up or down to account for working capital and net debt.

Even 0% tax rate won't help GE, J.P. Morgan analyst says
General Electric (GE +0.6%) opens higher even as J.P. Morgan reiterates its Underweight rating and $28 price target on the shares, as analyst Stephen Tusa says the company's fundamentals are more negative than he envisioned a year ago.GE bulls anticipate a favorable tax environment for the company under a Trump administration, but Tusa believes that even at zero, the tax impact for GE is only slightly more positive than the average for its peer group, given the limited benefits from a tax repatriation.”Fundamentally, we see more downside than upside" for GE, and fundamentals "will matter more than any one-time step up," Tusa writes.

GE deals may point toward possible succession
Dealmaking at General Electric (GE -0.4%) could point the way toward a possible line of succession, suggests Rob Cox, noting that merging with Alstom and Baker Hughes provides some clues to the company's path forward.Jeff Immelt doesn't have current plans to retire, but is 60, opening up investor speculation.Meanwhile, an Alstom deal suggests that Steve Bolze (in charge of the power division) may be in pole position. "Shortly after absorbing Alstom, GE more than doubled its targeted cost savings from the French company to $3 billion," Cox notes. "If these pan out over the next year or two, Mr. Bolze will be hard to beat for Mr. Immelt’s seat."Lorenzo Simonelli, who leads the oil and gas division integrating Baker Hughes, isn't far behind: "It is a complicated arrangement that presents a dramatic new blueprint should GE one day abandon its conglomerate structure."

GE upgraded at Bernstein on positive effects of more profitable growth
General Electric (GE +1.6%) pushes higher in early trading after Bernstein upgrades shares to Outperform from Market Perform with a $40 price target, noting a positive transformation in GE's asset portfolio and underperformance by the shares so far this year.Bernstein's Steven Winoker notes GE's consistently strong earnings growth while its portfolio has changed for the better, and says concerns regarding the risk for the restructuring of Alstom in Europe have been mitigated.The analyst also sees “a new set of catalysts in the form of potential tax reform, regulatory relief and other factors that should lift GE's businesses beyond 2018.”

Analyst reaction mixed following GE's $2 earnings target for 2018
Analysts are cautiously optimistic that General Electric (GE -1%) can achieve its earnings goal after the company reaffirmed its $2/share target for 2018 and offered a "high bar" forecast for revenue gains of 3%-5% next year.Goldman Sachs analyst Jon Ritchie maintains his Neutral rating and $31 price target, saying it is more positive on GE's margin trajectory and the progress on reorienting the company (digital, divesting non-core assets), but seeing downside to GE's 2018 EPS target and viewing current valuation as reasonable for a stock with below average EBIT growth over 2016-18.Barclays rates GE at Outperform and lifts its stock price target to $36 from $32, even as "numbers this year have just been OK, cash generation light, and the ramp to 2018 numbers is steep."Raising its target price to $37 from $36, RBC says it liked hearing that GE still has ~$10B of "unallocated" leverage capacity.

GE eyes sale of two smaller industrial units, another $1B in cost cuts
More from GE's analyst day: The company says it plans to raise $4B by selling two of its smaller industrial units and promises to cut another $1B in expenses.GE expects to sell its Industrial Solutions business, which supplies equipment to the electrical distribution and grid industries, and its GE Water business; the two units combined account for ~$5B in annual revenue.CEO Jeffrey Immelt says GE will be seeking ways to cut costs in the short run by shrinking its footprint and closing some facilities, the type of corporate actions that have triggered backlash from Pres.-elect Trump.Immelt also says GE has grown its foreign businesses twice as much as its domestic business over the last 15 years, and has sold 85% of its jet engines and gas-fired power turbines overseas.Earlier: General Electric reaffirms 2016-17 earnings guidance Dec. 14, 2016, 5:58 PM | 38 Comments

EMR, FTV, MMM, DHR poised to win from Trump’s lower taxes, analyst says
U.S.-based industrial companies such as Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Fortive (NYSE:FTV), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR) could enjoy sizable benefits from potential tax changes that could occur next year, as well as increased capital spending, Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker writes.The potential EPS upside of U.S. tax reform should reach double digits for the four companies, while Eaton (NYSE:ETN) - already at a group-low ~10% global effective tax rate - should see only minimal upside, according to Winoker, who notes that tax deductibility of capex investment also would spark spending in the U.S.Bernstein's covered companies derive between 10% (3M) and 60%-plus (Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK)) of revenues from customers’ capex spending, so the impact could be meaningful; the firm rates Allegion (NYSE:ALLE), DHR, Dover (NYSE:DOV), FTV, Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR), Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Pentair (NYSE:PNR) at Outperform, with EMR, ETN, General Electric (NYSE:GE), Idex (NYSE:IEX), MMM and ROK at Market Perform.

GE-Baker Hughes combo has potential but "a long-term game," Bernstein says
The combination of General Electric's (GE +0.8%) oil and gas business with Baker Hughes (BHI +0.4%) has the potential to challenge Schlumberger (SLB +0.2%), but "it's a long-term game," Bernstein analysts say.Following yesterday’s investor meeting, the Bernstein boys say they are more convinced by the merger's long-term potential but remain cautious on delivery timing; while the long-term potential and revenue enhancement concepts dominated the meeting, the firm says little information was revealed on timing beyond the already published synergy estimates.Bernstein agrees conceptually with management that GE-BHI will challenge SLB for large-scale, integrated, at-risk projects and leadership of new commercial models in E&P, but expects implementation will prove more challenging than conveyed at the investor meeting.

GE a top pick at Stifel with or without Trump bump
Stifel analysts say they are “fundamentally cautious” on industrial stocks but call General Electric (GE -0.3%) and Ingersoll-Rand (IR +0.9%) their top picks among their Buy-rated stocks in the group in both a base case slow-and-steady low-growth environment as well as a pro-growth Trump rally.The firm considers GE a solid, quality defensive play with an attractive 3% yield and likely would be a prime beneficiary of a Trump bump, but also a strong defensive component in its aftermarket/services stream, which accounts for ~45% of revenues and 80% of profits.Stifel says the Baker Hughes should effectively de-risk GE’s oil and gas exposure and allow management to pursue large scale restructuring of a $30B business while providing additional balance sheet flexibility going forward.

GE Power sees little sales impact even if U.S. quits climate deals
Sales of power plant upgrades by General Electric (NYSE:GE) would not suffer much even if the U.S. bails out of climate change treaties under a Trump administration, Paul McElhinney, CEO of GE's power services business, tells Reuters.Utilities still want the economic benefits that come with modernizations, McElhinney says, predicting "very robust" demand for products that can lower emissions and increase efficiency.GE, which supports climate agreements, says global CO2 emissions could be cut by 10%, or 1.1M metric tons/year, if current technology to boost the efficiency of coal and gas-fired power plants were installed in every plant now operating; the company says such upgrades cost ~55M for a coal plant and $10M for a natural gas plant.GE expects to land contracts worth ~$500M in the coming weeks, McElhinney says.

GE, ADM among JPMorgan's stocks to short in 2017
JPMorgan is out with its top stock picks for 2017, but as Jack Hough of Barron's points out, the "shorts" list is far more interesting because Sell recommendations from the sell-side are so much rarer than Buys.Of the 14-name shorts list, nine have price targets 10% or more below the current level.GE has 10% potential downside thanks to its too-rich valuation relative to free cash flow versus peers.Federated Investors (NYSE:FII) could fall 14% thanks to its exposure to the struggling active-management industry.Trucker C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) has 16% downside as favorable contracts reset to depressed industry levels.Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) has a price target 18% below the current value as a strong dollar and trade troubles with Mexico crimp profits.A 45% price decline could be in store for driller Forum Energy Technologies (NYSE:FET), with good assets and a healthy balance sheet, but way too fancy of a valuation.There's also Intelsat (NYSE:I), which JPMorgan says could be a zero as new competition squeezes the heavily leveraged company.Other shorts: Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD), Ensco (NYSE:ESV).

Buy Baker Hughes now that the GE dust has settled, Guggenheim says
It's time to buy Baker Hughes (BHI -0.2%) now that the dust has settled regarding the company's merger with General Electric's (GE +0.6%) oil and gas business, Guggenheim analysts say.Guggenheim estimates the new company will generate $4.9B in EBITDA in 2018 - a bit less than the $5.2B-$5.5B forecast by the companies - and should trade at a peer average 10.6x EBITDA, implying a fair value for BHI of ~$63, but the firm believes synergies provide another ~$4 of upside if GE is able to realize greater cost savings.The firm also finds the industrial logic is sound: As Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) has shown, regional and product line diversity enhance through-cycle returns and cash flow, which are benefits that the new BHI should be able to realize as a result of its pro forma portfolio.

Failed GE jet engine in O’Hare fire had manufacturing defect, NTSB says
A GE engine on an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) plane that exploded on a runway at O'Hare airport in Chicago a week ago had an apparent manufacturing defect, the National Transportation Safety Board said today.A disk within the CF6-80 engine had an “internal inclusion,” meaning foreign debris was embedded within the special alloy designed to withstand the heat and high stresses of a jet engine, the NTSB said.While the agency has not reached a conclusion about whether the flaw may be present in other engines, GE says it has not suffered such a failure in parts made with the same alloy in more than 30 years; GE says more than 4K of the various CF6 engines are in service and have flown more than 400M hours.

CFM International, a JV between General Electric (GE) and Safran (OTCPK:SAFRY -0.1%), has signed 2,195 orders worth $28B in the first nine months of 2016.The figure is already ahead of the 2,154 orders it received through the whole of 2015, CEO Jean-Paul Ebanga said at Airshow China.CFM has also signed up to be a supplier for the Comac C919 - China's long-awaited passenger jet - in early stages, but beyond that supply contracts are somewhat open to competition.

GE-Baker Hughes deal strikes right balance, Citi says
Citigroup analysts believe the deal between General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) strikes a good balance for GE and BHI, as GE is not selling at the bottom, valuation seems fair for BHI shareholders, and GE management retains control to roll out its digital and service focus across a much broader oil and gas platform.Citi views the deal (I, II, III) favorably, as it "reflects deployment of a meaningful portion of the ~$20B in incremental leverage GE had noted as available for transactions over the next few years," but valuation is reasonable and "the deal enhances [GE]’s visibility to EPS growth over the next several years."The firm also notes BHI’s weak stock showing, likely given concerns that GE’s "non-cash contribution to the deal (in the form of 37.5% of GE oil and gas) doesn’t provide enough value to Baker Hughes shareholders – we think that concern will diminish over time" given the improved competitive and cost position of the combined company.Simmons analyst Bill Herbert cites another likely reason for BHI's 6.3% swoon in today's trade: The new partnership leaves the company more leveraged to deepwater and international projects, which are not as flexible as the U.S. onshore business.

GE to sell its water business even as it raises bet on oil and gas
Almost as an afterthought in unveiling the merger of its oil and gas unit with Baker Hughes, General Electric (GE -0.1%) said it would sell its GE Water business, a move WSJ's Spencer Jakab calls "self-preservation."Both the water and the oil and gas businesses have been disappointing for GE, Jakab writes, but dumping the water business may be a matter of the number of losers that CEO Jeffrey Immelt can justify to activists such as Trian Fund: "Water might have paid off in the long run... but with GE raising its bet on oil, water just didn’t fit into the mix."Elsewhere, Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker says the deal with Baker Hughes is “positive strategically” for GE shareholders, and is an attractive structure for GE, noting that without requiring a full cash outlay for BHI, the new company provides GE shareholders with additional upside to an oil price recovery.Evercore analysts note the deal likely provides an avenue for GE to promote the widespread adoption of its Predix industrial internet platform, a focal point of the company’s long term strategy.Moody’s keeps its A1 credit rating for GE, saying increased exposure in oil and gas initially is credit negative but will pay out over an extended time horizon.

Baker Hughes, GE shares head in opposite directions as deal sinks in
Baker Hughes (BHI -1%) erases opening gains to trade in the red, while General Electric (GE +0.9%) is higher amid plans to combine their oil and gas operations.The new company will be 62.5% owned by GE, with GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli serving as President and CEO; GE will fund a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50/share, or $7.4B, to existing BHI shareholders, who will own 37.5% of the new company.The deal creates a company with more than $32B in FY 2015 revenue that could cut costs to better compete with rivals such as Schlumberger (SLB -0.9%) to provide equipment and services to oil rigs and wells; the $32B combined revenue places the new company only 8%-9% behind SLB.The combined companies expect to generate $1.6B of synergies by 2020, primarily driven by cost savings; GE expects the deal to be accretive to 2018 EPS by $0.04 and 2020 EPS by $0.08.Analysts see a high likelihood of the deal's completion given little product overlap outside of the Artificial Lift business and the relatively smaller size of the deal vs. the rejected Halliburton-Baker Hughes (HAL -0.5%) tie-up.Moody’s, Fitch and S&P all affirmed GE’s credit ratings with stable outlooks following the announcement.

Certain GE jet engines under investigation
A 19-year-old disc violently broke apart inside the engine of an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) jetliner taking off from O'Hare International Airport on Friday, sparking a massive fire and a wide-ranging probe into General Electric's (NYSE:GE) CF6 engines.The "uncontained" failure, which hurled fragments as far as half a mile from the scene, is unusual given modern protective casings, but at least four other planes powered by the same GE engine family have experienced serious malfunctions since 2000.Previously: Details on American Airlines engine failure (Oct. 30 2016)

WSJ: GE, Baker Hughes could reach deal as soon as next week
Merger discussions between General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) are advancing and could result in a deal as early as next week, WSJ reports.BHI +1.3% AH after surging 8.4% in today's trade following yesterday's WSJ report on a possible deal in the works; BHI today confirmed through an email to employees that it is in discussions with GE, while GE said late yesterday that the company was pursuing "potential partnerships" with BHI but not an "outright purchase."The companies reportedly are negotiating a complicated transaction, perhaps involving merging GE’s oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, which provides oilfield services, and then spinning off the combined business into a new public company.Any Reverse Morris Trust deal would allow GE to avoid a big tax bill and allow shareholders to reap any cost savings or other benefits from putting the two businesses together, as well as any upside from a rebound in oil prices.

End of U.S. nuclear industry seen without help from subsidies, Carlyle says
Nuclear power will come to an end in the U.S. if the industry fails to obtain more government support, Carlyle Group predicts.U.S. nuclear reactors need more subsidies to keep running, such as a federal carbon tax that would reward them for their zero-emissions power, according to Bob Mancini, co-head of Carlyle's power unit.Mancini points to measures approved in New York as an example of the kind of help nuclear power plant owners will need to survive; in August, NY state regulators cleared ~$500M/year in subsidies as part of a clean energy plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Relevant tickers include EXC, ETR, DUK, D, NEE, SO, PCG, ED, EIX, AEP, PPL, DTE, FE, NRG, PNM, POR, SCG, WR, XEL, LNT, GE, URA, NLR Oct. 26, 2016, 1:22 PM | 48 Comments

Honeywell's weak guidance surprise spooks investors in industrial shares
“This is the bottom” for Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) businesses exposed to the oil and gas industries, but troubles in the business jet industry “will get worse” next year, CEO David Cote said Friday, a day after the company cut its earnings and sales forecast, causing shares to slide 7.5% in their worst showing in five years."This was a surprise," says William Blair's Nick Heymann, as HON had been considered a safe-haven stock amid sluggish industrial growth, on Cote's reputation and record of delivering on profit targets.Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe compared HON’s announcement to a “paella bowl” dropped in front of investors and said “credibility is becoming a growing issue.”Other analysts are more confident: J.P. Morgan's Steve Tusa says "it's not that bad in the grand scheme," noting that HON’s profits are off ~5% YTD, roughly in line with its industrial peers.“While this quarter and maybe next quarter look to be a little bit worse than anticipated, we still believe they’re well positioned long term to benefit from growth opportunities," according to Edward Jones' Jeff WIndau.HON supplies parts to Textron (NYSE:TXT) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), which fell a respective 3.6% and 0.8% yesterday, while aerospace parts makers Heico (NYSE:HEI), B/E Aerospace (NASDAQ:BEAV) and TransDigm (NYSE:TDG) each slid more than 1%; also, GE slipped 0.6%, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 1.5%, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) lost 0.4%.

New York AG says EPA should not approve GE’s Hudson River cleanup
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is asking the EPA not to approve GE's $1.6B cleanup of the upper Hudson River, saying the agency has not proven whether dredging the river is working.The AG's office says the EPA should delay awarding a certificate of completion to GE for the work, and instead should conduct new studies of fish in the Hudson to determine how much of GE’s pollution remains in the river and how long it will be before humans can safely eat fish from the river again.GE says New York officials approved and oversaw “every major decision about the dredging project,” and that tests for PCBs in the upper Hudson have shown “significant declines” since seven years of dredging ended last October.

GE to partner with Mexican national power company
GE is partnering with Mexican national power company CFE in a two-year agreement to help improve the efficiency of its electrical system, Steve Bolze, the head of GE's power business, tells Reuters.Through software and analytics, "we're getting better performance out the assets for customers than the day they shipped" from factories, Bolze says.Mexico's 2013 energy reform ended decades-long oil and electricity monopolies enjoyed by the country’s state-owned energy companies Pemex and CFE, and GE now estimates a potential $1.3T in savings to the power industry over the next decade.

Cracked engine blade led to Southwest emergency landing last month
An engine failure on a Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) last month released debris that tore a 5"x16" hole in the plane before it made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Fla., crash investigators at the NTSB said today.In an update to its probe of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737's rare engine failure, the U.S. agency said a fan blade separated from the engine and was not recovered, except for the base of the blade that was still attached to the aircraft; the investigation update still has not solved the precise cause of the "uncontained" engine failure.The Aug. 27 flight, bound from New Orleans to Orlando with 99 passengers and five crew members aboard, lost cabin pressure and safely diverted to Pensacola; there were no injuries.LUV and GE, which produced the engine with Safran in a CFM International joint venture, says they are working closely with the NTSB on the probe.

GE closes lower after 3-D deals, as analysts see few short-term benefits
GE's $1.4B purchase of a pair of 3D-printer companies sent stocks in the group soaring in today's trade, with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) closing +5.5%, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) +3.7%, Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) +4.6% and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) +5.8%.But GE closed 0.7% lower, as analysts say that while 3D printing is promising, GE’s acquisitions are a “net negative” because there are relatively few short-term benefits.“This seems like a relatively outsized and expensive bet, with no near-term return, and an incremental opportunity cost when considering the ongoing debate around what we view as finite balance sheet capacity,” says J.P. Morgan's Steve Tusa.Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna takes a longer view, saying that “while the deals appear pricey, they help position GE to lead, implement and control additive manufacturing processes that will become important cost-reduction levers long term in Aviation and elsewhere."As for the 3-D companies, Citigroup’s Kenneth Wong says that while the GE deal does not present any immediate competition for them, it does not necessarily suggest any buyout implications for the companies since GE is focusing on metal applications.

GE seeks more Brazil wind turbines, but weak economy hurting power demand
General Electric (GE -0.5%) plans to install 500 wind turbines in Brazil next year, bringing its installations there to 2,600, or 37% of the country’s expected 2017 total, but is having difficulty closing new contracts amid the country’s economic slump, according to Jean-Claude Fernand Robert, GE’s head of wind in Latin America.Robert believes the economic crisis in Brazil is "a phase," but the weak economy has hurt demand for power, driving down interest in new power supply deals; Brazil has planned three power auctions this year, compared with seven last year, an April auction saw no bids offered for wind farm contracts.Brazil needs to add ~2 GW/year of power to support existing turbine factories and other suppliers, GE says.GE is Brazil’s top wind turbine supplier, and its turbines account for 40% of the country’s installed wind capacity, based on megawatts.

Reuters: Siemens, Gamesa reject bids from GE for wind power JV
Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY +0.3%) and Gamesa (OTCPK:GCTAF) have rejected a non-binding offer from General Electric (GE +0.3%) for assets belonging to the Adwen wind power joint venture between Gamesa and Areva (OTCPK:ARVCF), Reuters reports.Gamesa is merging with Siemens' wind power division to create the world's biggest builder of wind farms in a €10B ($11 billion) deal, but the Adwen venture has been a sticking point, as Siemens does not need the technology from Areva because it has developed its own offshore wind turbines.If Areva does not find a buyer before a mid-September deadline set when Siemens and Gamesa announced their merger in June, the most likely outcome would be for Gamesa to exercise its purchase option and take over Areva's 50% stake, according to the report.

Federal offshore chief warns drillers to find solution to subsea bolt failures
The U.S. government's top offshore drilling regulator is warning subsea oil drillers and equipment makers that bolt failures in the Gulf of Mexico could result in an oil spill on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.Regulators and makers of oil production equipment - including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) - are trying to determine what is causing the problems, which have been found over the past four years on safety equipment in underwater oil production, including on blowout preventers, which are designed as a last defense against a major oil spill such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident.The offshore drilling industry had discussed possibly replacing all the bolts in question in the Gulf over a period of years, but Brian Salerno, director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, says the discussions have ended after a better understanding of the problem.GE issued a global recall after its bolts on a piece of undersea equipment in the Gulf of Mexico failed in 2012, an incident that was reported to the government, but government officials say many more were not, masking the extent of the problem.

New York says GE’s Hudson River cleanup still not adequate
General Electric's (NYSE:GE) seven-year, $1.6B dredging campaign to remove industrial pollutants from the Hudson River has been inadequate, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation says in a letter urging the federal EPA to closely scrutinize the effectiveness of dredging in its project review due to be released by April 2017.At least 136 acres of river bottom and 35% of the PCBs discharged from a pair of GE factories along the Hudson near Albany have not been removed, the state agency says, adding that it has asked permission from the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Champlain Canal, which runs into and at times is a channel of the upper Hudson.New York's move could pose a new PCB-related headache for GE, which has been eager to move past the cleanup obligations that have long dogged the company.

GE's plan to take on $20B more debt could pressure ratings, Moody's says
General Electric's (GE +0.3%) plan to take on $20B of debt could pressure the company's credit ratings despite its operational strengths, Moody's says.The prospect of additional debt is the latest sign that GE is "consciously shifting toward a credit profile that is more fully levered and typical of other large industrial peers... compounded by the ballooning debt-like pension deficit GE is already facing, further elevating leverage," the ratings agency says.Moody's downgraded GE's senior unsecured debt rating to A1 in April 2015 due to concerns about the company's now more industrial-focused, less diverse collection of businesses; reduced resiliency of cash flows and earnings; and a shift to more aggressive shareholder return policies.

GE says $250M Doosan deal will boost Alstom revenue
General Electric (GE -0.2%) says its recent $250M purchase of part of Korea's Doosan Engineering & Construction will sharply boost revenues from its $9.5B purchase of Alstom power assets last year.GE's purchase of Doosan's heat recovery steam generator unit provides critical engineering and manufacturing capacity the company needs as its Alstom-linked sales increase, Joe Mastrangelo, CEO of GE's gas power systems business, tells Reuters.GE says it has added 30 orders for heat recovery steam generators to its backlog since the Alstom deal closed last November vs. 14/year that GE typically sold before the acquisition; the Doosan HRSG business will help GE fill the new orders while also gaining after-sale service revenue and project management capability, Mastrangelo says.

GE trending toward disappointing earnings through 2018, J.P. Morgan warns
GE shares slumped another 1.3% in today's trade to their lowest levels this month after J.P. Morgan issued a bearish note warning that GE's Q3 is trending well below initial estimates ahead of a big Q4 that historically has missed expectations."As the hysteria around transformation fades, and the focus shifts to actual numbers, what's left is a core, fundamental outlook for earnings and free cash flow that we think is at best stable, at worst deteriorating, and undoubtedly below consensus," J.P. Morgan analysts write.The firm is concerned that its $2.00 EPS target for GE in 2018 was based on organic growth that may have been too ambitious, and it lowers its 2018 EPS target to just $1.75."This profile, including high expectations which are now too high and worst-in-class [free cash flow] is neither safe nor deserved of a high multiple," the firm says, adding that it rates GE at Underweight with a Street-low $26 price target.

GE ramp-up in the second half of the year is critical, analysts say
General Electric (NYSE:GE) was yesterday's biggest laggard among Dow stocks, sinking 1.6% after reporting a 2% drop in orders for Q2, with industrial orders - GE’s jet engines, power turbines, oil production equipment, et. al. - plunging 16% amid weakness in oil and gas prices that hurt demand."The texture of this quarter is very similar to the two most recent quarters, with exceptionally weak orders,” says Morgan Stanley's Nigel Coe, who rates GE at Equal Weight with a $32 price target.GE's total Q2 revenues rose 15% Y/Y to $33.5B, but organic industrial sales excluding the Alstom acquisition fell 1%; GE needs to meet its own expectations for a substantial upturn in organic trends in H2 in an "extremely challenging" environment, Coe says."Those are capital intensive purchases and if those get pushed out even just a little bit" it could weaken GE's performance, says Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.Andrew Elofson at Davidson Investment Advisors takes the long view, seeing Q2 as "a speed bump on the path to their transformation” and not really looking at whether GE can hit its 5% organic sales growth target for H2.But Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas responded to the Q2 results by slapping a Sell rating on GE with a $26 price target, seeing no reason to own the shares that trade at more than 20x 2016 EPS estimates while "dozens" of mid-cap names with room to grow trade at or below 10x earnings - such as YRCW, TGI, AVH, GBX, ARII, CBI, UAL, SPR and ACM.

General Electric dips on slipping orders
GE reported earnings growth of $0.52 (+65% Y/Y) and revenue of $33.5B (+15% Y/Y) for Q2, but shares fell 1.8% in premarket action due to a 2% decrease in orders and "a volatile and slow-growth economy."The company said its power, aviation and health-care segments offset challenges in transportation and in oil and gas, but it expects to see strong organic growth in the second half of the year."We will continue to invest in key growth initiatives such as GE Digital, while returning [about] $26B to investors through buyback and dividends," CEO Jeff Immelt declared.GE Capital's exit plan has enabled it to return $15B in dividends year to date, and the company’s de-designation as a SIFI will give it more balance sheet flexibility.Q2 results Jul. 22, 2016, 7:48 AM | 12 Comments

GE hits eight-year high; some analysts see more upside
General Electric (GE +0.8%) rallies to its highest level in eight years after announcing that its Predix industrial operating system will be available on Microsoft's Azure cloud, but the company's sustained upward march has been a long time coming.Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management thinks GE's upward momentum will continue, thanks to underappreciated fundamentals as the company has "gotten rid of the bad stuff [and] has doubled down on the good stuff... aerospace, the Internet of things, health care [and] robotics and automation. Those are four of the most important secular bull markets over the next 5-10 years."Brown sees GE's balance sheet as flexible enough "to buy back more stock, raise their dividends and even do acquisitions... there aren't any flies on this story."Citigroup analysts see “another sloppy quarter” overall for industrial stocks but considers GE a top pick, with the potential for GE’s service business to grow by 9% Y/Y from 7%, a key driver because service represents close to 80% of GE's profits, which means the company’s growth visibility could be better than investors believe.

GE (GE +1.1%), oil drillers and regulators are scrambling to determine why massive bolts used to connect subsea oil equipment keep failing, causing alarm over the safety of hundreds of wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Dow Jones reports.A U.S. investigation and two recent bolt failures have convinced regulators and industry officials that the problem goes beyond GE and its blowout preventers, according to the report; the Interior Department says flaws also have been found in bolts made by National Oilwell Varco (NOV +2.5%) and Schlumberger (SLB +1.3%), and in bolts used in other areas on subsea wells.GE says it is working with the Interior Department to address the problems and has supplied replacement parts to customers upon request.Companies already have begun the process of finding and replacing corroded bolts; Diamond Offshore (DO +1.9%), which has a fleet of 30 rigs, told investors in June that it had four unplanned “stack pulls” in Q2 with three of the repairs involving failed bolts, interruptions that likely will impact Q2 results.

'Smartest Man' buying industrials - Barclays
The unnamed "smartest man" is one who analyst Scott Davis believes is "the most thoughtful industrial investor."Citing high and rising dividend yields, good cash flow, solid balance sheets, ability to hold/expand margins with cost cuts, this investor thinks industrials (NYSEARCA:XLI) like GE and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) could be part of a modern day "nifty fifty."This attitude is particularly noteworthy given Davis' last report from the "smartest man" had him selling GE to buy high-beta names.

GE sees revenue from digital ops more than doubling to $15B by 2020
GE plans to invest more than $1B into its fast-growing software business this year, which it says will help drive rapid growth for its GE Digital business en route to $15B in revenues by 2020, 2.5x the ~$6B it is expected to bring in this year.At today's GE Digital investor meeting, CFO Jeff Bornstein and other execs offered the first detailed breakdown of the software operations that GE increasingly sees as an essential complement to its manufacturing business; by using software and sensors, GE seeks to boost the efficiency and reliability of equipment such as gas turbines and jet engines.GE also sees strong potential from its Predix operating system, which can be used to build applications and enhance products made by GE as well as by other companies; Bornstein says sales from Predix will reach ~$4B in 2020 from “virtually zero’’ today.GE's digital operations may grow to represent as much as 25% of company earnings in the coming years, William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann says: "This is a business, it’s not just a productivity improvement tool. It actually creates tangible sales and very high-margin earnings even though most people don’t have the concept that this is anything more than cotton candy." Jun. 23, 2016, 6:24 PM | 13 Comments

Analysts doubt planned cost cuts from Siemens-Gamesa wind power deal
Siemens’ (OTCPK:SIEGY +2.7%) $11B wind power turbine merger with Gamesa (OTCPK:GCTAY -1.7%) creates a market giant to rival Vestas Wind Systems (OTCPK:VWDRY) and GE but faces a challenge in harnessing planned savings, according to analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley.Barclays expects only a fraction of the planned 70M revenue synergies will be achieved, and does not believe the onshore and offshore businesses offer "any sort of synergy potential" in sales, as the two businesses deal with different customers, technology and drivers.Siemens and Gamesa have identified €230M in cost cuts within four years, and while the product synergies “are clear,” achieving that target remains a risk, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Uglow says.Nevertheless, Stanley rates Siemens a Buy as "in terms of product overlap, Siemens brings a number one position in offshore turbines [and a] strong offering in developed markets.” Jun. 20, 2016, 11:48 AM | 3 Comments

GE, Alstom accused of decade-old bribes by ex-Petrobras exec
A high-ranking former Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) executive has told investigators that General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) paid bribes to win contracts more than a decade ago, in the latest expansion of Brazil’s huge Car Wash corruption scandal.Nestor Cervero, who once headed PBR’s international division, claims he received $700K in bribes from Alstom in exchange for choosing the company to supply four turbines for power plant projects, and that he had second-hand information that GE also bribed an official to win turbine contracts.Cervero, who was convicted last year of crimes including corruption and money laundering, says he obtained information from an associate that Alstom and GE each paid $10M in bribes to former senator and former PBR exec Delcidio Amaral in the late 1990s or early 2000s.GE says it is "not aware of any irregularity or wrongdoing in the contracts mentioned.’’ Jun. 7, 2016, 11:45 PM | 12 Comments

Barron's Bennett defends GE against analyst pessimism

GE gets bearish view from J.P. Morgan, saying risks don't support premium
General Electric (GE -1.2%) is the Dow's biggest loser in the early going after JPMorgan Chase resumes coverage with an Underweight rating with a $27 price target, saying positives from the company's portfolio transformation and its technology potential are more than reflected in its current stock price.The firm says GE has achieved a "bold portfolio transformation” and has solid technology potential but the positives are factored in the shares, but the risk/reward is unfavorable in view of "a stubbornly high expectation forward earnings curve” combined with soft underlying earnings quality and free cash flow.GE's 2018 EPS target of $2.00 may be difficult to achieve, JPM says, since it would require two years of 10% profit growth following 1% growth in 2015-16 amid recent 5%-10% order declines."We don't argue that these are not 'good businesses,' what we argue with is ability to consistently outperform," JPM analyst Stephen Tusa writes.

Chance to buy the dip in GE about over
Down more than 2% not long ago, GE has rebounded to just a marginal loss in late-afternoon trade.Sellers seem to have focused on a 1% Y/Y decline in organic revenue, led by a 18% fall in revenue from the oil and gas equipment business - now GE's fourth-largest segment.The company, though, remains headed in the right direction, writes Johanna Bennett in Barron's. Profits are rising at a double-digit pace and there's plenty of cash to aggressively buy back stock and fund acquisitions. There's also the 2.9% dividend yield. Despite the weak top-line print today, GE affirmed full-year organic sales growth guidance of 2-4%, along with EPS of $1.45-$1.55.There's also Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund which invested $2.5B in October, seeing 70% upside for the shares.Now read: General Electric (GE) Jeffrey R.

FAA mandates engine-icing fixes affecting up to 150 Boeing 787 jets
The FAA has ordered fixes for General Electric (GE -0.9%) engines powering as many as 150 Boeing (BA +0.5%) 787 jets worldwide that are considered susceptible to sudden in-flight shutdowns due to internal ice accumulation, WSJ reports.A safety directive released this week indicates that certain upgraded models of GE’s most advanced engine pose an unacceptable safety risk because internal ice buildup could result in both engines of a 787 shutting down simultaneously, and the FAA calls the possibility that engines could not be restarted “an urgent safety issue.”Boeing and GE have been working on the issue for months, but the FAA’s move requires special notices to go out to pilots within a week and for carriers to must fix or replace at least one of the suspect engines on all affected 787 Dreamliners within five months.Now read A boring or banging year ahead for the Dreamliner?

Dow Jones: Halliburton, Baker Hughes in talks to sell $7B in assets to Carlyle
P-E firm Carlyle Group (CG -1%) is in serious talks to buy oilfield services assets from Halliburton (HAL -0.4%) and Baker Hughes (BHI +5.2%) that could be valued at more than $7B, Dow Jones reports.The talks would mark a shift for HAL and BHI, which have focused on overcoming Justice Department objections to their planned merger by attempting to sell the assets to General Electric (GE +0.1%); GE remains in the mix, but reaching agreement on a price for the assets has been difficult, according to the report.The need for HAL and BHI to strike a divestiture deal took on increased urgency last week when the DoJ filed an antitrust lawsuit challenging their proposed $35B merger.Now read The Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger is falling apart - what happens next?

Stick with Baker Hughes and $3.5B breakup fee if deal fails, FBR says
Halliburton (HAL -0.6%) and Baker Hughes (BHI -1.8%) are lower today in the wake of yesterday's DoJ decision to block their proposed merger, when both stocks rose in an oil price surge-fueled group rally.Even with much lower odds of closing, FBR analysts still like BHI's risk/reward - if the deal fails, BHI would benefit from the $3.5B breakup fee, with the ability to fully implement restructuring initiatives that have been constrained by the merger deal; if the deal succeeds, FBR believes the stock will deliver a 40% return, all else constant, within 3-4 months.FBR also thinks any "Hail Mary” solution likely still relies on GE (GE -0.9%), and believes GE is the “prospective buyer” with whom HAL has had “lengthy discussions.”Now read Baker Hughes a Buy if Halliburton deal folds, Wells Fargo says and Baker Hughes downgraded at Deutsche Bank, as deal close "a coin flip at best" Apr. 7, 2016, 3:33 PM | 10 Comments

GE cut to Hold from Buy at Bernstein after shares hit eight-year high

Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) -2.2% premarket following a NY Post report that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is making a last-ditch bid to save their proposed merger but the Justice Department is leaning against it.The DoJ has not made a final decision on whether to file a lawsuit to block the deal, but it could announce its opposition as soon as this week's American Bar Association annual antitrust conference in Washington, according to the report.HAL is on the hook to pay a $3.5B break-up fee to BHI if the deal falls apart; BHI also could walk away from the deal at the end of April - and might do so - to collect the fee if the DoJ does not act by that time, the report says.Regulators reportedly have asked HAL to sell assets with ~$10B in revenue, which it is struggling to do after the collapse in oil prices; GE is said to be the only company willing to buy some of the assets, with Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) out of the bidding.Now read Halliburton and Baker Hughes: Is it time to cut losses?

General Electric (GE +1.2%) is higher after Citigroup analysts make bullish comments about its power business, proclaiming "we do know a well-run facility when we see it" following a visit to the company's gas turbine facility in Greenville, S. Car., according to Barron's.Citi thinks that given more expensive parts and given the low cost to run it, GE's H Turbine should garner a much higher level of service activity than the F Class Turbine, and that GE continues to improve its ability to tie contract service agreements to its original equipment in power.The firm believes customers are likely more receptive to the idea as well because GE now offers a full power “solution” given its Alstom acquisition, which means customers no longer have to turn elsewhere for other service providers.

Buy Honeywell over GE, Deutsche Bank says
Honeywell (HON +0.1%) is a better buy for investors than General Electric (GE -0.5%), Deutsche Bank analysts say, as its fundamentals have continued to line up more favorably over the past few weeks with "an abundance of favorable HON attributes that should allow HON to outperform GE."Deutsche Bank raises its target price on Buy-rated HON to $120 from $105, and considers HON's reaffirmed guidance too conservative, saying an extra two points of realized top line growth at 30% incremental profit contribution could drive ~$0.25 higher EPS than its current $7.05 forecast, or more if the company also pursued faster share repurchase.In contrast, the firm sees little upside from the GE consensus forecast over the next two years, particularly considering the rollover GE has experienced for its equipment orders over the past two quarters.

Diamond Offshore CEO: Oil industry in a "severe and prolonged down cycle"
The oil industry nightmare will not end anytime soon, and "it seems clear that the oversupply of drilling capacity may persist well into 2017 and possibly beyond," Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO) CEO Marc Edwards said in today's earnings conference call."Deepwater drilling will recover... What I can't tell you is when," the CEO said; in the meantime, DO is not only eliminating its dividend, but also considering mergers and/or acquisitions, buying distressed assets, and other crisis measures.Analysts like DO's new service agreement with GE, which is expected to help lower idle time for rigs on hire - crucial for drillers struggling to lease out offshore rigs and cut costs as oil and gas producers scale back spending.DO loses up to $500K of revenue each day a rig is down, while the oil and gas producing customer also loses as much money, Edwards says, calling downtime the industry's "Achilles' heel."Evercore ISI analyst James West says the service model will create a much more visible stream of cash flow for equipment providers compared with the cash flow from selling equipment, "which is very cyclical and very lumpy."Among companies that could adopt a similar model are offshore rig providers such as Noble Corp. (NYSE:NE), which could tie up with oilfield equipment manufacturers such as National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Cameron (NYSE:CAM), analysts say. Feb. 8, 2016, 6:58 PM | 17 Comments
Diamond Offshore scraps dividend; posts Q4 earnings beat on lower costs
Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO) says it is discontinuing its dividend after reporting Q4 earnings of $0.89/share, excluding a $499M non-cash charge related to the impairment of nine drilling units.DO has paid a regular dividend of $0.125/share every quarter since mid-2005; suspending it will save ~$69M annually.DO says Q4 drilling revenue totaled $544M, 19% lower than the $674M in the prior-year quarter, while related expenses fell 29% Y/Y to $256M from $359 a year ago.Q4 dayrates on its ultra-deepwater floating rigs rose to $531K from $493K in the year-ago quarter, and the utilization rate rose to 70% from 66% a year ago.DO also says it is transferring the maintenance and service of well control equipment to General Electric's (NYSE:GE) oil and gas unit, in an attempt to simplify operations and reduce downtime.Under the 10-year service agreement, GE will buy the blowout preventer systems on four of DO's rigs located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for $210M.

CFM jet engine sales top 2,150 in 2015
Aircraft engine maker CFM International, a joint venture of GE and France's Safran (OTC:SAFRF), says it sold 2,154 engines last year valued at $27B, including 1,418 LEAP engines and 736 CFM56 motors.CFM says its backlog of LEAP engines, which power the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF, OTCPK:EADSY) A320neo jetliners, now stands at more than 10K units valued at $140B.The results come after problems developed with the Geared Turbofan engine, which competes with the LEAP and is made by rival Pratt & Whitney (NYSE:UTX), which says the problem - which requires a three-minute cooling procedure before the engine can be restarted - should be fixed this month.

Reuters: State Street nears deal for GE's asset management operation
General Electric's (GE -1.8%) asset management arm had $115B in AUM as of June 30, with much of that the retirement plans for the vast majority of the company's 13K U.S. employees.According to Reuters, State Street (NYSE:STT) has won the battle over a number of other bidders, including Goldman Sachs, and is now in final negotiations. An agreement with a sale price in the area of $500M could come as early as this month.Proceeds from the sale will go into beefing up GE's pension trust - underfunded by $15.8B as of the end of 2014.For State Street, it would be a nice pickup in AUM to help offset sizable fund outflows last year. The company had about $2T in AUM as of Dec. 31. Feb. 5, 2016, 12:44 PM | 2 Comments
GE to phase out compact fluorescent light bulbs
The compact fluorescent light bulb, once the undisputed energy-efficient alternative, is being overtaken by LEDs and will not be made or sold in the U.S. by General Electric (NYSE:GE) by year’s end.Prices for LEDs, once ~$30/bulb, have been dropping steadily, falling well below $5 for a basic bulb last year, in part because of government regulations making it easier for them to qualify for generous discounts; as a result, LEDs reached 15% of bulb shipments in Q3 of last year, a 237% Y/Y jump.Retailers including Walmart, Sam's Club and Ikea have been moving away from CFLs, which will have a harder time qualifying for the Energy Star rating under regulations proposed for next year, GE says.

Oil prices weigh on GE, but bad oil news can become good news in the future
GE shares fell 1.2% in today's trade even after reporting better than expected Q4 earnings and as the broader market rallied sharply, as results from the oil and gas business - now the company's fourth largest segment by revenue - spooked investors.Revenue in GE's oil and gas unit slid 16% for Q4 and 14% for FY 2015 to $16.45B, but Heard On The Street's Charles Grant says "today’s pain means the likelihood of generating future high investment returns goes up," adding that GE’s diverse revenue allows it to take advantage of the sluggish environment better than stand-alone oil peers.Meanwhile, GE said in today's earnings conference call that plans to spend $3.4B on restructuring measures this year, double the $1.7B it targeted just last monthi, "with an emphasis on oil and gas" operations.GE says its application to drop its “too big to fail” label is unlikely to come before March; CFO Jeff Bornstein says GE is poised to close the sale of $30B in commercial lending assets and unload a Utah bank charter, and then plans to ask the Fed to remove it from the ranks of systemically important financial institutions.

GE remains upbeat on China
China’s slowdown has rattled global markets, but General Electric (GE +3.2%) vice chairman John Rice remains upbeat, telling the World Economic Forum in Davos that "there’s not anything happening in China today that causes us to alter our long-term strategy there."Rice says GE has enjoyed strong demand in China and other countries where growth rates have slowed, benefiting from larger-scale infrastructure projects, particularly in energy, that continue to move ahead."In a world where we haven’t been sure what was going to happen with [the U.S. Ex-Im Bank], there is capital in China ready to go where we see business," Rice says, noting China's cooperation on a $1B power deal in Pakistan last year.The focus on the volatility in China’s stock market and the slumping currency misses the underlying strength of an economy that is still growing at a rate that is the envy of much of the world, according to Rachel Duan, GE’s China chief.GE, which now has a workforce of 25K in China, reports Q4 earnings before the market opens tomorrow.

Any deal terms offered by state and local governments in Massachusetts aren't yet known.It's a loss for New York, which had hoped to bring GE to Westchester County or Manhattan.GE first publicly threatened to move in July after a CT budget deal added to what management said was an already inhospitable business climate there. It makes for a good excuse, but the company had also outgrown its campus in staid Fairfield, and Boston will no doubt be an easier spot from which to lure talent.

GE Healthcare backs Toronto-based cell therapy development center
GE Healthcare (GE +0.2%), the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev) and the Center for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine (CCRM) are teaming up to build an advanced therapeutic cell technologies center in Toronto backed by a CAD$40M investment from GE and FedDev Ontario.The aim of the project is to accelerate the development and adoption of cell manufacturing technologies that improve patient access to new regenerative medicine-base therapies.GE and CCRM encourage pharmaceutical, biotech and cell therapy companies to get involved, considering forecasts that the global market for cell-based therapies could be as large as US$20B in ten years.GE Healthcare chief Kieran Murphy says, "It is increasingly clear that cell therapies and regenerative medicine will transform healthcare globally, but successful industrialization is now crucial to widespread adoption. This new center will enable us to work with cell therapy companies to push beyond existing technical limits and problem-solve. Toronto's concentrated and collaborative clinical infrastructure, combined with the strong guidance of the internationally-renowned CCRM, make it an ideal location for the center."

Since April's announcement of a plan to sell most GE Capital assets, GE has inked deals for $149B of the roughly $200B in intends to sell. More than $100B of these transactions have now taken place (the company had guided for $90B by the end of this year).No longer a bank disguised an industrial company, GE plans to apply for SIFI de-designation in Q1.The sales and exit plan is expected to be mostly complete by the end of next year, and should result in about $35B in capital kicked back to the parent.There was also last month's split of Synchrony Financial which reduced the GE's float by about 6.6% - the equivalent of a $20.4B buyback.This all puts GE on track to return more than $90B to investors through 2018, with more than 90% of earnings coming from industrial businesses.Shares -0.2% after hours Dec. 9, 2015, 4:38 PM | 11 Comments
Electrolux to pay $175M breakup fee for failed GE deal
Electrolux (OTC:ELUXF, OTCPK:ELUXY) agrees to pay GE a $175M breakup fee following this week's collapse of its deal to acquire its small-appliances unit.Electrolux also says it will cut costs of ~190M kronor at the unit, with staff reductions and reduced operations in the U.S., Sweden and China.Analysts say the breakup fee, compounded with the botched promise of creating a rival of Chinese leaders and Whirlpool, also might cost Keith McLoughlin his job as Electrolux CEO.

SA author: GE's entrance enhances chances of HAL/BHI deal
GE would best satisfy the desire by regulators in both the U.S. and EU for a third provider of integrated oil services contracts," says Seeking Alpha contributor Chris DeMuth, responding to a report the company is near a deal to purchase Halliburton's (HAL +5.2%) drill bits and drilling services divisions.A potential deal, he says, means a good chance of Halliburton being spared a massive breakup fee, and then being able to realize the significant cost savings of a merger with Baker Hughes (BHI +7.3%).

Halliburton, Baker Hughes higher on report of GE interest in drilling assets
Halliburton (HAL +4.5%) and Baker Hughes (BHI +6.9%) remain higher after Bloomberg reports that GE (GE +0.8%) is in advanced talks to buy HAL's drill bits and drilling services divisions (earlier).Selling both businesses could have fetched as much as $5B combined earlier this year when the units were put on the block, but it is not clear how much the decline in oil prices may have affected their respective market values.GE also is exploring bids for other assets that HAL is seeking to unload, including parts of BHI’s completions operations, according to the report.While the timeline for closing the merger already has been pushed out to Dec. 15 at the earliest, HAL's acting CFO Christian Garcia says he sees a strong likelihood the deal does not close until sometime in 2016.

GE will still find appliance buyer despite deal collapse, analyst says
The collapse of General Electric's (GE -1.1%) sale of its appliance business to Electrolux is disappointing but not a particularly big setback for GE, says Bernstein’s Steven Winoker.GE will collect a $175M fee from Electrolux, which will help offset the damage done by not selling the unit, which should come out to just $0.02/share during Q4, Winoker says; appliances will add to earnings in 2016, at least until sold to a different buyer, which Winoker expects to happen sometime next year.Winoker thinks GE may look outside the U.S. or to P-E firms to find a new buyer for the business.

Analyst lists eight reasons GE's takeover of Alstom is extraordinary
Bernstein analyst Steve Winoker offers eight reasons for optimism following yesterday's conference call from General Electric (NYSE:GE) updating its takeover of Alstom's energy assets.At the top of the list, GE built a more robust business case for value addition over time that creates a $50B turbine services backlog and puts it on track to save $3B through cost cuts by 2020, Winoker says.With enhanced offerings for boilers, steam turbines, gas and steam turbine generators and grid solutions, Alstom increases GE’s scope in a combined cycle power plant to 60% from 20% to 60%, and brings the ability to serve the installed base of other OEM’s, a key potential growth driver.Among other reasons cited by Winoker, management describes the Alstom integration as one of the best transitions it has seen.

Immelt: GE focused, balanced, a good bet for investors
General Electric (GE -0.6%) is a good bet for investors after pulling a turnaround, CEO Jeffrey Immelt says.In an interview with Jim Cramer, Immelt pointed to a number of factors, including the quick spinouts of some financial businesses and fast, organic growth in its industrial business."When I look at the next three years, the GE team knows exactly what we have to do," Immelt said. "We've got all the tools to do it with, and I think from a capital allocation, earnings growth, organic growth standpoint, we are a good bet for investors right now."The multibusiness structure helps, he added: "While the only-gas business may be tougher, the aviation business is booming, and you add all of those up and you get an industrial organic growth in the mid-single digits. That looks damn good in the environment we are in right now. So, that's what it takes."Elsewhere: GE will pay just $2.25M as a penalty for releasing potentially unsafe air pollution from a hazardous waste incinerator in New York state, and for filing false pollution control reports.

House, Senate agree on long-term highway bill, reauthorizing Ex-Im Bank
House and Senate negotiators reach agreement on a five-year highway bill that also would reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which has been advocated by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and General Electric (NYSE:GE).The bill would be partly financed by use of Fed surplus funds and a cut in the dividends received by commercial banks that own the Fed, a step that is criticized by the American Bankers Association."Dramatically reducing the dividend rate - without hearings, consultation with committees of jurisdiction, study or analysis of any kind whatsoever - is extremely bad public policy,” says ABA President Rob Nichols.The agreement dodges the larger issue of identifying a long-term source of revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, as the bill does not raise the $0.184/gallon federal gasoline tax.House Speaker Ryan predicts the bill will enjoy “good majority support” when it comes up for a full vote.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF Dec. 1, 2015, 4:27 PM | 104 Comments

Focus on industrial stocks with strong end markets, Bernstein analyst says
Market growth remains challenging whether there is an industrial recession or not, so investors should focus on stocks with strong end markets, particularly Allegion (ALLE +0.3%) and Danaher (DHR +0.5%), Bernstein's Steven Winoker says.Other stocks in a lower but still generally favorable tier include General Electric (GE +0.8%), Honeywell (HON +0.9%), Ingersoll-Rand (IR +0.9%) and 3M (MMM +0.7%), as these companies are exposed to favorable end markets but also to meaningfully weak markets, the analyst says.Aside from their portfolio transformations, DHR and GE have benefited and should continue to benefit from their above-average growth profiles in the current low-growth environment, Winoker says.Energy-heavy Dover (DOV +0.2%), Pentair (PNR +0.4%) and Emerson Electric (EMR +0.2%) remain the most challenged, according to Winoker, while Eaton (ETN +1.1%), Rockwell Automation (ROK +0.5%) and Tyco (TYC -0.2%) have a mix of tailwinds and headwinds, with the former more challenged on hydraulics/trucks and the latter two on energy.Winoker sees limited downside for DOV, which is highly linked to crude oil prices but is performing well in the ~80% of its portfolio not linked to oil.Earlier: Low expectations are no longer enough for multi-industry stocks, analyst says (Nov. 19) Nov. 20, 2015, 11:30 AM | 3 Comments

Judge pushing settlement in U.S. dispute over GE-Electrolux deal
In the trial adjudicating an antitrust fight between the Dept. of Justice and Electrolux (OTCPK:ELUXY +2.5%) and General Electric (GE -0.8%), Electrolux's chief argued again his company should be able to pursue a $3.3B deal for GE's appliance business.The government has alleged that in a relatively consolidate market, U.S. consumers would pay 5% more for kitchen appliances if Electrolux got to stop competing with GE appliances. It's pursuing an injunction to stop the deal, but judge Emmet Sullivan is again pressing the two sides to settle.Electrolux -- which makes Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan brands -- has said the DOJ isn't taking into account foreign competition, but today CEO Keith McLoughlin acknowledged the company's internal documents describe the U.S. appliance market as relatively consolidated compared to Europe. He's suggesting price increases in the U.S. have been prompted by hikes in input materials, including steel, nickel and petrochemicals.The Justice Dept. is focusing on the lower-end kitchen appliances often put by homebuilders into new houses and apartments or sold at big box stores; 90% of the stoves and ovens sold to big builders and property managers are made by Electrolux, GE and Whirlpool, it says.Previously: Trial begins as U.S. opposes $3.3B Electrolux-GE appliance deal (Nov. 09 2015) Nov. 19, 2015, 6:19 PM | 3 Comments

Nervous over Peltz, S&P lowers GE credit outlook to Negative
Nelson Peltz's purchase of a $2.5B stake in General Electric GE prompts Standard & Poor's to reduce its outlook on GE's credit rating to Negative from Stable, which puts the company’s AA+ rating on watch for a potential downgrade.Peltz's Trian fund is suggesting that GE should shed even more of GE Capital, be cautious on acquisitions and add up to $20B in debt to support stock repurchases, which comes after GE management already had made statements implying it could adopt a less conservative financial policy, the ratings firm says.The Negative outlook "reflects our expectation that the company could potentially adopt a less conservative financial policy,” S&P says, adding that it could cut the credit rating if GE “significantly increases” its debt load or shrinks its industrial focus along with its finance unit.

Morgan analysts warn that companies with large amounts of floating-rate debt - including Chesapeake Energy, Freeport McMoRan, Ford and GE - could be at risk if the Fed decides to raise interest rates.Companies with variable/floating-rate debt suffer a more immediate impact by a rate hike than companies with fixed-rate debt, the analysts say; variable-rate coupons typically reset quarterly, meaning that changes in the base rate flow through almost immediately to variable-rate borrowers, while fixed-rate borrowers do not see such an impact until they refinance or issue new debt.JPM lists 25 companies - not including financials - that have the “highest variable-rate debt as a percentage of market cap": FMC, NRG, FCX, AES, CVC, LVLT, PVH, CHK, FE, DVA, THC, OI, CNX, F, HCA, FOSL, RCL, JOY, GE, ADS, ALLE, HBI, GT, DNB, AN

Facing what it deems to be an inhospitable climate for business in Connecticut, GE plans to make a decision by year-end on whether to depart its headquarters of the last 40+ years.As the company considers where to move to, it's not just about local tax issues - GE is also looking at the voting records of each state lawmakers on issues like the fight to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.

Boeing jet suffered rare engine failure, U.S. air safety regulator says
Initial findings from the National Transportation Safety Board determine that the fire that heavily damaged a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 British Airways' jet in Las Vegas earlier this week was not contained within the core of the plane's left General Electric (NYSE:GE) engine, a rare event that will intensify scrutiny of the incident.The uncontained failure is the first on a GE90 engine since its introduction to service in 1995, and aerospace engineers have designed their potential causes out of modern jet engines as spewing debris can cause catastrophic damage to a plane's fuselage and wing.The GE90 model aboard the plane was an older variant of the turbofan engine; Boeing has an exclusivity agreement with GE, which supplies a larger more-powerful GE90 engine for the 777s built today.GE says it has sent technical personnel to Las Vegas to assist in the investigation and that it is premature to discuss the NTSB's findings.

In an acknowledgement of General Electric's (GE -0.4%) plans to dramatically shrink its bank-like businesses, the Fed will delay until 2018 the time when GE Capital would have to face the central bank's annual stress test.The operation would still need to comply with basic capital and liquidity rules by the start of the year, though GE Capital says it's already met these.GE Capital's assets stood at about $500B not long ago, and it has assured the Fed of its plans to sell the bulk of them, and indeed has already sold or put under agreement a sizable amount.Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo: "It would not be sensible for us to disregard GE’s announced plan to reduce [GE Capital’s] size by about 70%, particularly in light of the fact that it is demonstrably executing that plan."

Synchrony Financial on the move following Q2 results
"The growth story appears very much intact," says BTIG's Mark Palmer, reiterating his Buy rating and $36 price target on Synchrony Financial (SYF +3.6%) following its earnings beat this morning.One key concern of the bulls is what happens when GE later this year distributes its 84.6% stake in Synchrony to those GE shareholders electing to take the stock. The success of the exchange, says Palmer, depends on whether GE owners buy into the growth prospects of SYF's private-label credit card business. These results, combined with a trio of new partnership deals during the quarter, should go a long way toward that.Previously: Deposits grow, asset quality improves at Synchrony Financial (July 17)Previously: Synchrony Financial beats by $0.03, beats on revenue (July 17) Jul. 17, 2015, 12:11 PM | 18 Comments

As GE’s divestiture plans hit hurdles, alternatives begin to be considered
U.S. and European regulatory resistance could force GE to seek other deals and perhaps more share buybacks, as two of the company's moves to focus on higher-margin products are now in doubt over concerns they will hurt competition.GE executives today met with European authorities in Brussels to ease concerns that its planned acquisition of Alstom's power equipment business would leave Europe with two gas turbine players."Alstom is in that core of what they're trying to become," says Oakbrook's Peter Jankovskis. "If you can't lock up Alstom, your path for generating earnings is going to have to change."If Alstom falls through - and GE has said the deal could add $0.15-$0.20 to EPS in 2018 - analysts say GE likely would pursue other acquisitions to boost its core industrial businesses, buy back more shares, or a combination of both.Yesterday, the U.S. government sued to block GE's appliances sale to Electrolux, saying it would stifle competition for items such as stove tops, ranges and ovens.Should the appliances sale to Electrolux collapse, GE could seek buyers such as LG Electronics, Samsung Electronics, Chinese manufacturers or Mexico's Mabe, in which GE holds a stake, or P-E companies.

Electrolux CEO: Settlement over GE deal still an option

Justice Department sues to block Electrolux’s $3.3B deal with GE
The U.S. Justice Department says it has filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping Electrolux (OTC:ELUXF, OTCPK:ELUXY) from buying GE's appliance business, saying the deal would hurt competition and consumers by combining two of the top makers of major cooking appliances.GE says it will vigorously defend the proposed acquisition as pro-competitive and pro-consumer, and that its goal remains to close the deal this year.It is not good news for GE, which wants to be an industrial conglomerate, is seeking to rid itself of most of its financial exposure business, and has wanted to get out of appliances unit for years now.Earlier: Bloomberg: GE unit sale to Electrolux opposed by antitrust staff Jul. 1, 2015, 3:14 PM | 28 Comments

Bids for five GE Capital (GE -0.8%) Australian commercial lending and leasing businesses - fleet financing, private plane financing, equipment rental, working capital lending, leveraged loans - were due on Monday, and a number of usual suspects have expressed interest. Few, however, are seeing a whole lot of value thanks to a lack of scale and margins.GE's consumer lending business in Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was the subject of fierce competition among potential buyers, ultimately gong for $6.3B to a consortium of Varde Partners, KKR, and Deutsche Bank.In an effort to keep interest going for the commercial businesses, Morgan Stanley - hired by GE to take care of the sale - isn't keeping a strict timetable of when preliminary bids must be submitted.Source: NYT Jun. 15, 2015, 2:41 PM

GE’s finance exit means billions more for M&A
GE's $12B deal to sell its U.S. private-equity lending business to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is just the beginning of its plan to shed ~$200B of GE Capital assets - and a whole lot of cash to spend on takeovers.Although GE may not make a move right away as it tries to complete the $14B purchase of most of Alstom’s energy business, Bloomberg figures it could amass a $40B war chest for takeovers.Among speculated targets: Pentair (NYSE:PNR), a provider of water pumps and filtration systems; Flowserve (NYSE:FLS), a maker of industrial pumps and valves; electrical components manufacturer Hubbell (HUB.A, HUB.B); life sciences equipment maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (NYSE:BIO); and some of the assets Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) will divest as part of their merger.Whatever the target, acquisitions likely will be part of GE’s transformation after asset sales and returning capital to shareholders.

How big is GE Capital?
In a letter to the Federal Reserve in May, General Electric (NYSE:GE) said its finance arm had $501B in total assets at the end of 2014, enough to rank it as the country’s seventh largest bank.Just weeks earlier, however, GE had used a different number - $363B - in a presentation to investors and analysts.The $138B separating the two figures is the difference between what official accounting rules require (sent to the Fed) and what GE calls "ending net investment" (an in-house metric the company rolled out seven years ago when it was under pressure during the financial crisis), WSJ reports."We disclose ENI in addition to total assets so that our investors can better assess our total capital invested in financial services," GE spokesman Seth Martin said.To accounting experts, however, it could just be another in a long line of "pro forma" figures that companies have trotted out over the years to show their business in a better light.

Do you feel bad about that? I've always believed in accountability, but the company needed to change (and that takes time to do). When I first became CEO there was a difference between image and reality, but today they are alike.How difficult was it for you to succeed Jack Welch? And when did you feel that you came out of his shadow? I never thought of myself like that. It's a new place and a new day. We're changing the face of the company going forward.After GE is done with its restructuring, what will its finance division look like? We will be a $135B-$140B company with $10B in finance. Our finance division will only stick to energy, aviation and markets we know.

Bloomberg: GE near deal to sell fleet-management assets
It's a $9B business for General Electric (GE -0.7%) in which it leases and manages 1.4M autos and trucks, mostly in the U.S. for mid-sized and large companies.The company, says Bloomberg, is in advanced talks to sell the assets to Toronto-based Element Financial (OTC:ELEEF) which bought PHH's fleet-management business about a year ago.

GE would sell intellectual property rights to secure Alstom deal, Immelt says
GE is willing to sell intellectual property rights to allay European Commission concerns that its $17B acquisition of Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) could distort competition in the gas turbine market, CEO Jeff Immelt said today.The comments are the most concrete indication to date of what remedy GE is willing to offer to break an impasse over approval for the deal.Immelt said GE would not do anything that impacts the service revenue stream.The EC has argued that a combined GE-Alstom would control about half of the market for 50Hz frequency turbines in Europe and the rest of the world excluding China; as a rule of thumb, the EC is wary of post-merger concentrations greater than 40%.GE rejects concerns that the tie-up would distort competition, saying that European demand is too small for distortions of competition to be a serious concern, as only about four gas turbines are sold in Europe each year out of global sales of 200.Earlier: Immelt presents: GE Capital sales ahead of plan May 20, 2015, 7:07 PM | 11 Comments

GE says it would lose Angola locomotive deal if Ex-Im Bank closes
GE would lose a $350M deal to build locomotives for Angola, and perhaps billions of dollars more in future export opportunities, if Congress closes the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the head of GE's transportation unit tells Reuters.GE's Russell Stokes claims up to 1,800 jobs at GE, its suppliers and local businesses in 12 states would be put at risk because, without Ex-Im financing, Angola would buy Chinese-built locomotives.The bank's opponents say its loans amount to corporate welfare and that GE can seek private financing, but the exec says private financing could never compare to the lower rates offered by government-backed export credit agencies."We'd still go out and try to compete, [but] on some of these big international tenders like this one, you're going to lose," Stokes says.

Barron's: Honeywell a better bet than GE
With the shedding of its finance arm last month, GE has indicated that it can deliver 10% earnings growth annually from its industrial side in the next four years, but Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has been delivering on 10%-plus profit growth ever since it remade itself more than a decade ago.Honeywell shares could rise by about 20% in the next year and close to 50% in the longer-term if it continues to meet its forecasts and improve its margins, writes Barron's Sandra Ward.HON shares are trading at around 15x the company's 2016 earnings estimates, well below the average of 17x assigned to multi-industrial companies.In contrast to GE, which saw its shares lose 33% of their value in the past 13 years as its strategy meandered and its massive financial operations foundered, Honeywell has risen 200%. Sales have nearly doubled to $40B, and its market value has mushroomed to $80B from $20B. May 11, 2015, 8:07 AM | 14 Comments

Einhorn: GE's chicanery on earnings
"That GE chose to exit and finally own up to its cumulative chicanery rather than face its first Fed-supervised stress test is one of the real successes of Dodd-Frank," writes David Einhorn, noting the "staggering" $16B after-tax charge the company will take this quarter in connection with the plan to sell GE Capital's assets."Given that GE is exiting these portfolios after several years of economic and valuation recoveries and still has to take an enormous loss, the gigacharge adds clarity to the multi-decade debate about the integrity of GE's reported results."The charge will also drain another 5-7% from S&P 500 quarterly earnings.

Strong dollar hit to GE, Honeywell may not bode well for other industrials
GE and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) say they will take steps to cushion the impact of a stronger dollar, after GE said foreign currency effects whacked $950M, or four percentage points, off its Q1 sales, while HON also reported a four-point Q1 drag from a stronger dollar and projected that exchange fluctuations would weigh down sales by $1.7B this year.GE says it is considering different locations where it can manufacture products or components for businesses, such as its power and healthcare units, and HON has been hedging transactions that its individual foreign subsidiaries make when they import in dollars, and now it is also hedging when the company's foreign sales are translated back into the dollar.The impact of currency shifts on U.S. companies will be highlighted further next week with quarterly reports from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which already cut its 2015 financial forecast in January over currency worries, as well as from 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW).

GE's Immelt touts conglomerate's scale but notes need to reduce banking ops
In his annual letter to shareholders, GE (GE +1.6%) CEO Jeffrey Immelt says he plans to stick by his company's model for housing diverse businesses under one roof even as other U.S. conglomerates are looking to shed units."The value of the GE Store is captured by faster growth at higher margins; it makes the totality of GE more competitive than the parts," Immelt writes, also citing examples such as how the company can use aircraft engine alternators to improve motors for pumping oil.At the same time, the letter says GE is focused on making its massive GE Capital banking operations - whose returns have fallen below the company's cost of capital - smaller and more connected to GE’s industrial businesses.Immelt says GE's new LEAP jet engine and H-class gas turbine will generate $100B in combined revenue over their lives, and that the company will register at least $1B in sales in Ghana this year, joining 22 other countries.

GE more focused on raising profit margins, analyst says
General Electric (NYSE:GE) made the case at its Tech Day presentation yesterday that global research leverage and synergies across businesses make them better together.UBS analyst Shannon O'Callaghan notes that GE is now focused on increasing its profit margins after declining to 26.5% in 2014 from 28% in 2011 due to a changing mix, but he now sees "a significant turn taking place with the whole organization aligned to attack gross margins. The cost structure has been broken down into components that each have an owner with mechanisms to track progress, plus an incentive compensation structure that supports the plan."O’Callaghan rates GE a Buy with a $30 price target.

Whether GE's Immelt stays or leaves matters little, J.P. Morgan analysts say
GE shares have enjoyed a solid two weeks or so, as investors speculated about the possible departure of CEO Jeffrey Immelt, which some believe could be a catalyst for better performance.J.P. Morgan analysts aren't so sure, believing the focus should remain on the fundamental ultimate earnings trajectory, which is essentially unchanged and for which the firm remains below consensus with no organic growth in 2016.What's more, the analysts see no indication of an imminent transition, and they do not believe a new CEO would change the plan materially enough to merit a more constructive stance on the stock.

GE reportedly weighing deeper cuts to banking business
GE is considering making deeper cuts in its banking business, deciding that returns from lending are no longer worth the opposition it provokes among investors, Dow Jones reports.While the company has long committed to shrinking GE Capital, it has also viewed a smaller, safer banking business as an integral part of a conglomerate; but now, GE is believed to see the bulk of the lending operation as severable, similar to how the company viewed its appliances business which it sold last year.The reassessment comes as CEO Jeff Immelt is under pressure to remake GE as a more focused industrial company and win over investors, but scaling back GE Capital would mean sacrificing a unit that generated $2.3B in profit last year.

GE's Immelt gets salary, cash bonus bump for 2014
General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt earned ~8% increases in his salary and cash bonus in 2014, with his salary rising to $3.75M and his cash bonus moving to $5.4M, according to an SEC filing.The GE compensation committee says Immelt "performed very well" in 2014, although GE shares fell ~10% for the year, underperforming gains for the broader U.S. stock market; the CEO is praised in the proxy for hitting company goals such as making progress in tilting GE's earnings toward industrial manufacturing and away from its finance operations.Immelt's total 2014 compensation nearly doubled to $37.2M, with much of the increase coming from a big jump in the value of his pension; without the change in pension value, the CEO's compensation was valued at $18.85M, down 2% from 2013, Mar. 10, 2015, 7:08 PM | 57 Comments
Siemens tops global wind turbine market as GE rises, Vestas slips
Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) gained over Vestas (OTCPK:VWDRY) as the leader in the global wind turbine market as measured by market share of newly installed machines connected to the grid in 2014, according to a new industry report.But the gap is small, as wind turbine units of Siemens, General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Vestas ranged between 10.8% and 10.1% each of global market share, showing the intense competition in the industry.GE climbed to second place from fifth the previous year, due to turbines that already had been installed in 2013 but were only turned on in 2014.Siemens accounted for 76% of new capacity installed offshore last year in the world and 88% offshore Europe.

Immelt speculation highlights potential GE CEO successors
A Barclays note suggesting GE CEO Jeff Immelt could step down within the next year has prompted speculation over who could be next in line for the top post.Barclays sees CFO Jeff Bornstein as a front-runner, but analysts say GE has "deep bench strength, much deeper than most corporations" - other possibilities may include power and water unit head Steve Bolze, oil and gas chief Lorenzo Simonelli, and Vice Chairman John Rice.While GE has a history of grooming candidates internally, a sharp slump in the business could force it to look outside, some say; “If you don’t change the scenery you’re going to get the same thing," says Huntington Asset Advisors' Peter Sorrentino.Immelt still has his fans, such as Harbor Advisory's Jack De Gan, who says “late ’16, early ’17 is a time when the market should really be appreciating the work he’s done."Earlier: Lower oil prices are hurting Immelt's GE overhaul Mar. 5, 2015, 11:49 AM | 17 Comments
Lower oil prices are hurting Immelt's GE overhaul
GE's Jeff Immelt estimates he has sold 65% of the company he inherited some 13 years ago in order to streamline it, but at the same time he bet big on energy by spending $14B on oil services companies, and some investors are dissatisfied, WSJ reports.Oil and gas accounted directly or indirectly for a quarter of GE's $100B in industrial revenue last year, but as oil prices have tanked, the CEO is now warning that the business could see revenue and earnings both drop as much as 5% in 2015.GE says customers probably will delay future exploration and production, but that 60% of its oil and gas business is in booked orders and that the difficulty some of its customers have in stopping oil operations actually will help the company.Earlier: Barclays; GE's Immelt may quit within the next year Mar. 4, 2015, 7:37 PM | 18 Comments

General Electric's (GE -0.7%) CEO Jeff Immelt may step down within the next year as investors seek change at the industrial giant, Bloomberg reports quoting Barclays analyst Scott Davis."Though CEO Jeff Immelt has arguably had a good run since the near collapse in 2008-2009, most investors are ready for a change at the top now," said Davis, who rates GE as overweight.According to the report, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein is likely to be his successor after proving effective in cutting costs and improving earnings quality.GE shares have fallen 34% during Immelt’s tenure, while the S&P 500 Industrials index has doubled in that time.

The EU confirms it will open an in-depth investigation into whether GE's (GE -0.1%) planned acquisition of Alstom's (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) energy unit might limit competition in the market for heavy-duty gas turbines.EU authorities regularly open in-depth probes to assess specific aspects of large deals, but the move still adds months to the timeline and new uncertainty into GE’s biggest ever deal.GE says the gas turbine market is global and highly competitive, and disagrees with the EU's preliminary concerns.Alstom CEO Patrick Kron has said he expected only limited overlaps where European regulators might require that the company divest operations for competitive reasons.

"Having said that, we’re going to play offense... like crazy in 2015."Bornstein says GE, which has spent $14B on deals to build its oil business since 2007, is even open to further acquisition opportunities, pointing out that "a lot of these companies are worth 30%-40% less than they were five months ago."Earlier: General Electric beats expectations Jan. 23, 2015, 3:30 PM | 13 Comments

Bill Nygren likes Chesapeake Energy and GE
"If you think the long-term price of oil is going to be $45 per barrel, there's basically nothing in this sector it makes any sense to own," Oakmark Funds' Bill Nygren tells CNBC, but he quickly adds he doesn't expect that. Checking futures out five years, the price is $70 per barrel, and a look at cost of production - near $70 - means production is going to be shutting down at current prices.One energy sector pick is Chesapeake Energy (CHK +5%). There's a stale perception of the stock, says Nygren, of a company designed to grow the top line as much as possible. But new management is laser-focused on maximizing rate of return, and their work at deleveraging the balance sheet is now allowing buybacks.Nygren's also liking General Electric (GE -0.4%), noting its underperformance - nearly 2000 basis points over the past year - and discounted valuation means the company only has to be average for the stock to go up. He also takes note of the new CFO as changing the focus to cash returns rather than reported earnings. Jan. 14, 2015, 3:49 PM | 14 Comments

GE's Alstom purchase shows corruption need not be a deal killer
This week’s settlement with Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY) over its bribery schemes appears to mean that there's little cause for worry when buying a company with a history of corruption around the world as long as the company’s sins look to be in its past.GE will not need to worry about Alstom’s $772M criminal fine when it buys most of the French company next year, according to the U.S. Department of Justice; in fact, as part of guilty plea deal reached with Alstom, prosecutors "insisted” that none of the penalty be passed to back to GE.Prosecutors let GE off the hook even though allegations of Alstom’s bribe schemes were known for years, but one goal of DoJ enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act actually is to encourage the sale of companies that have engaged in misconduct.

Energy exposure to hurt GE, analysts say
General Electric (NYSE:GE) was the day's biggest loser among the Dow 30, as J.P. Morgan analysts Stephen Tusa and Rajat Gupta include GE among among industrial companies confronted with big risks through their exposure to oil drilling."The game has changed," the analysts say in now seeing a spread in EPS growth between those that have material exposure to energy and those that do not to a range of ~800 bps; regarding GE, JPM drops oil/gas growth to -2% from +5% and power/water growth to zero from +3% on the back of distributed power weakness, which it pegs at mid-single digit declines for two years, along with the onset of a decline in gas turbines.The firm also downgrades Dover (NYSE:DOV) to Underweight, reaffirms its Underweight on Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), and continues to avoid Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), SPX Corp. (NYSE:SPW) and GE; it still likes a few with oil/gas exposure, such as Pentair (NYSE:PNR) given ongoing execution/margin potential, and Honeywell (NYSE:HON), given less direct impact and a strong balance sheet story.

Federal Reserve: GE Capital to be regulated like a bank
"In light of the substantial similarity of GE Capital's activities and risk profile to that of a similarly-sized bank holding company, the Board is proposing to apply enhanced prudential standards to GECC that are generally similar to those that apply to large bank holding companies," says the Fed, opening up a 60-day comment period on the idea.The Financial Stability Oversight Council last year designated GE Capital as a non-bank SIFI.In addition to having to comply with the so-called enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, GE Capital will be subject to restrictions on inter-company transactions between it and General Electric.

The conglomerate plans to have a presence with its wind turbine business in 35 or more countries next year, up from eight in 2003.Anne McEntee, CEO of GE's renewable energy business, points to the importance of diversifying into different countries to take advantage of where energy demand and policy are encouraging.GE does not disclose revenue for its wind business, which is part of its Power & Water segment, but it ranked as the world's fifth-biggest wind-turbine supplier last year according to Navigant Research.

Halliburton's dubious distinction: Stock's post-deal performance worst YTD
Halliburton’s (NYSE:HAL) $34.6B buyout of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) has caused HAL shares to plunge 12% since the deal was announced Monday, the worst two-day performance for an acquirer’s stock this year; on average, a company announcing a deal has seen its stock pop 3.1% on the news.But analysts say the deal may present game-changing opportunities for a few small and mid-cap oilfield services firms with enough cash on hand to buy a chunk of HAL's expected divestments without diluting their stock or damaging their credit rating.Tudor Pickering Holt's Jeff Tillery speculates that Forum Energy Technologies (NYSE:FET), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and GE would be interested in HAL's manufacturing businesses that may come up for bid, while Superior Energy Services (NYSE:SPN) and Frank's International (NYSE:FI) might want certain services-oriented businesses.Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) would seem like a logical buyer of some assets and could make it happen with a mix of cash and stock, but RBC's Kurt Hallead thinks HAL might not want to cooperate with a company that could essentially become what Baker Hughes was.

Halliburton-Baker Hughes hookup likely to spark more energy M&A
In the wake of Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) $34.6B offer for Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), it appears the next hot sector for M&A action is energy: More consolidation is likely, given the weakness for stocks in the oilfield services subsector, low interest rates, and as a drop in demand for oil increases cutthroat pricing competition.Speculation is running rampant as investors try to figure out who is next in an industry that is sure to undergo some more consolidation; some names identified as possible candidates include Kodiak Oil and Gas (NYSE:KOG), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Northern Oil and Gas (NYSEMKT:NOG), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD).GE could go after National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) to show it is serious about the energy industry after last year’s purchase of pumpmaker Lufkin, Royal Bank of Canada says, and Oppenheimer says even BP could be an acquisition candidate.But Morgan Stanley does not see offshore drillers getting in on the action, as larger players like Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO), Transocean (NYSE:RIG) and Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) are still addressing dividend concerns while smaller companies such as Atwood Oceanics (NYSE:ATW) and Pacific Drilling (NYSE:PACD) still trade close to replacement value.

GE highlights infrastructure demand of developing markets as growth driver
General Electric (NYSE:GE) expects developing markets to be a "huge engine" of growth due to their demand for the company's infrastructure products."We should continue to grow at double-digit rates in those growth markets, even with a global economy that's kind of inching along," says John Rice, vice chairman and president of GE's global growth organization. "We think that there is still a significant pent-up demand for infrastructure."With its recent Alstom acquisition and sale of its appliance business, GE is shifting more toward industrial operations while shrinking its finance business and shedding non-core units.

Barron's Sears suggests ways to play potential for GE breakup
Some analysts lately have been calling for a breakup of GE, most notably Barclays' Scott Davis, who says GE might try to regain its lost luster by breaking itself into smaller listed companies, as AT&T once did.Davis wants the company to completely shed all parts of its GE Capital business (which GE has started to do), and thinks spinning off GE's medical devices business also should be on the table; basically, anything that's not part of GE's global infrastructure related divisions - energy, aviation, transportation - could be fair game to go.Barron's Steven Sears suggests selling GE puts and buying long-dated calls in anticipation that investor pressure rises for GE to simplify its operations and even break itself up into many companies that are easier to value.

GE flops after strong but "noisy" Q2 results
GE's (GE -1%) Q2 results at a glance look just fine: Net profit jumped by more than 13% Y/Y, revenue rose by 3%, orders from international growth markets climbed 6%, and the Synchrony IPO and Alstom acquisition appear on track.So what's not to like? After popping higher at the open, shares drifted lower and have stayed there amid what Bernstein analysts call a “noisy” quarter."Unlike last quarter, this quarter is not so clean," Bernstein says, adding that at the end of all the puts and takes on gains and tax rates and other differences, GE came in about penny below its expectations; the firm says it is concerned about the second quarter of equipment order decline and pressure in pricing for the order book outside of aviation.

Caterpillar locomotive market share may fall far behind GE
Due to new stricter U.S. locomotive emission standards, freight train manufacturers are facing pressure to update their product lines by January 1. The result of the new legislation may lead Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to fall far behind GE (NYSE:GE) in the race to produce locomotives that comply with the new standards.Caterpillar's famous Electro-Motive Diesel unit announced that its freight trains will not be ready until 2017, paving a clear path for GE to obtain an increased market share.GE is already testing locomotives that conform to the new regulations, and is looking to snatch Caterpillar's customers during its two-year absence from the market. GE already has an estimated 60% to 70% of the domestic freight train market.The concerns don't particularly bother Caterpillar, which expects companies to delay buying new locomotives until the technology is perfected. "History indicates that the railroads are slow to adopt new technology until it is fully proven in the field," says a Caterpillar spokeswoman. Caterpillar will also have overseas sales, which reached $2.5B last year, to make up for the time it will be locked out of the U.S. market. Jul. 14, 2014, 9:15 AM | 12 Comments

Column: Jeff Immelt is the American Canada needs to lead oil sands clean-up
The problem facing Canada isn't the Keystone pipeline or Pres. Obama or environmentalists - it's the oil sands, and they've got to be cleaned up and the head-in-the-sand denials chased way or the country will be stuck with a "baby seal hunt" image, Diane Francis writes in the Financial Post.The columnist thinks she knows the right person to lead the clean-up: Jeff Immelt - "an American leader with stature in Washington, on Wall Street, in the oil patch and in Silicon Valley" - who said this week that GE will help companies clean up the oil sands.The only way to stop the environmental excuses, Immelt believes, is for the industry to collaborate and voluntarily establish lower emissions targets that would make the oil sands competitive with any other fuel source in the world - without such a promise to provide cleaner energy, "all bets are off."Some related companies: XOM, IMO, SU, RDS.A, RDS.B.

Bloomberg: GE likely to announce $604M Brazil wind-turbine deal
General Electric (GE -0.4%) is likely to announce a deal worth up to $604M, to supply wind turbines for Brazilian developer Casa dos Ventos, Bloomberg reports. The deal involves two separate contracts.For the first contract, Casa dos Ventos is looking to buy $366M of turbines, to replace a previous delivery from Enercon GmbH’s Wobben Windpower, which the latter stated it will not be able to fulfill.The second deal will be decided within the next two weeks, as Casa dos Ventos determines whether to buy an additional 150MW of turbines worth $238M for a possible wind park acquisition. That contract hinges on a guarantee from GE to deliver the turbines before 2015, when the project needs to be fully operational for the government of Brazil.By the end of this year, GE will be the top turbine supplier in Brazil, with a 24% market share.ETFs: BRXX Jun. 30, 2014, 10:40 AM | 2 Comments

Alstom's board accepts GE bid
After receiving the French government's blessing on Friday, General Electric's (GE) improved bid has been officially accepted by Alstom's (ALSMY) board. The approval marks an end to the bidding war between GE and Siemens (SIEGY)-Mitsubishi (MHVYF).The closing of the deal is still contingent upon the French government finding an agreement with Bouygues (BOUYF). The former wishes to buy a 20% stake in Alstom before allowing GE to buy the group. After the French state purchases its 20% stake, Alstom will be left as a holding company, paving the way for three 50-50 joint ventures with GE.Once the deal is closed, Alstom will then buy GE's train signalling business.The approved offer still values the power equipment company at $17B, but prices the Alstom investment in the joint-ventures at $3.4B.

GE set to prevail in its bid for Alstom, but some see a Pyrrhic victory
GE is the apparent winner in the contest for Alstom (ALSMY), shutting out Siemens (SIEGY) and Mitsubishi (MHVYF), as the French government has given its blessing to GE’s offer while buying a 20% stake for itself - which means GE is now effectively going into business with the French state.In the ~$13.5B deal, GE would acquire Alstom’s natural gas turbine operations along with its valuable customer base while selling to Alstom its railroad signaling business, and 50-50 joint ventures would be created for steam turbines, renewable energy and electrical grid systems.The concessions will mean a smaller boost to GE's profit and fewer cost savings from the deal, and could complicate decision making in situations where the French government feels it has an interest, a William Blair analyst says.GE's Jeffrey Immelt says it's not the straight takeover of the energy business he had envisioned, but that 86% of the deal's synergies - essentially the value of the energy business - were outside of the joint ventures.Alstom's board is due to decide on the deal by Monday, when GE's binding offer expires.

GE (GE +0.1%) is considering selling its train signaling business to Alstom (ALSMY), as it seeks ways to improve the appeal of its $17B offer for the French company's energy business, WSJ reports.A direct sale would send GE beyond its initial proposal outlined last month by CEO Jeffrey Immelt during a parliamentary hearing in France to consider pooling its signaling operations with Alstom's into a joint venture.GE may propose to Alstom that it choose between a direct purchase and a joint venture, which would allow the maker of France's TGV bullet trains to decide whether it would rather conserve cash for other acquisitions or spend a chunk of it on buying GE's signaling unit.

Siemens (SIEGY) and Mitsubishi (MHVYF) reportedly are putting the finishing touches on a joint offer for Alstom's (ALSMY) turbine businesses that includes ~€9B cash.GE has offered €12.35B ($16.9B) for all of Alstom's energy assets, including turbines, renewables and grid operations, but a source tells Reuters "the offer can't be compared with that of GE as they're so different in nature."Under the complex proposal, Alstom would have a future in the energy business and be at the center of a European rail champion - both potentially attractive prospects for the French government - but would turn Alstom into an unwieldy holding company with stakes in disparate businesses, which may make it difficult to convince Paris that its deal is a jobs creator.

GE to go alone on Alstom bid
GE Vice Chairman John Rice has stated that General Electric (GE) will pursue its bid over Alstom (ALSMY) alone. The statement comes after Siemens (SIEGY) announced it would partner up with Mitsubishi (MHVYF) and possibly Hitachi (HTHIY) for a joint bid over the French energy business.“We don’t think we need a partner in the context of our bid,” says Rice. “We feel really good about the way the process is working, and interactions that we had with the government.”GE has put in a $17B bid for Alstom.

Siemens would keep stake in Alstom trains combination, exec says
Siemens (SIEGY +0.5%) would keep a minority stake in any enlarged Alstom (ALSMY) train-making business if its plan to buy the French company's power business succeeds, a Siemens exec tells a French newspaper.Reiterating that Siemens is serious about making a counter-proposal to an offer from GE before its self-imposed deadline of June 16, the head of the German company's France unit says SIEGY also is "willing to discuss our activities in rail signaling, which carry twice the weight of Alstom's."

New pollution rules should prove profitable for GE’s turbine business
Likely among the clear winners in the EPA's new carbon framework will be engineering giants General Electric (GE) and Siemens (SIEGY); every utility that moves to overhaul a gas plant with more efficient turbines, or makes the bigger switch to natural gas from coal, could represent a customer for those companies’ high-efficiency turbines.GE only sold a few of its top of the line gas-fueled power turbines in the U.S. last year, continuing a streak going back more than a decade, but new regulations on carbon emissions could eventually mean better results.For Siemens and some of its industrial peers, the government’s push for more efficiency could prove profitable in other ways, if it spurs capital investment in energy monitoring and efficiency systems they also make.

Bloomberg: Germany considering Alstom stake via KfW for Siemens
The German government is considering buying a stake in Alstom (ALSMY) via its state-owned KfW development bank if Siemens’ (SIEGY) proposal to create two European champions in rail and energy succeeds, Bloomberg reports.The plan would be contingent on the French government buying an equal stake in Alstom from Bouygues (BOUYF); the German government’s strategy is that the unit would be akin to Airbus, in which the French and German states hold similar-sized stakes.Siemens is competing with GE's $17B bid to acquire Alstom's energy assets.

Siemens CEO tries to calm furor over job cuts, could affect Alstom deal
Siemens' (SIEGY) CEO Joe Kaeser is in damage control a day after he let it slip an investor conference that the company's current restructuring affects 11,600 positions.In a letter to employees today, Kaeser said Siemens' overhaul would lead to changes, but calls press reports of such a reduction "wrong or are based on a false interpretation... I did mention the [job] numbers reported, but at the same time emphasized that some positions could be put to work elsewhere."It's not clear whether the comments might hurt Siemens' chances of winning Alstom's (ALSMY) power assets away from GE, but the headlines can't help his cause in France, particularly after GE's Jeff Immelt promised to create 1,000 new engineering and manufacturing jobs if his company wins the deal.

Immelt says GE is open to an alliance with France
GE is willing to partner with France's government in a possible alliance, CEO Jeffrey Immelt told French lawmakers today, as he tried to win their support for GE's bid for Alstom's (ALSMY) power equipment business.Immelt didn't offer specifics, but GE hadn't previously stated a willingness to a government investment in a business resulting from any acquisition of Alstom's assets.A GE spokesman says the company is not offering the French government a stake in the steam turbine business; French Economy Minister Montebourg is worried that a GE deal could disrupt the supply of Alstom turbines to Electricité de France (ECIFF), which uses them to make France's world-class nuclear reactors.Immelt said today GE understands the "importance of the sovereignty of the nuclear industry" in France, adding that GE had been working with EDF for decades.Siemens' (SIEGY) Christophe de Maistre told the lawmakers today that his company's eventual bid would spawn two separate companies: a power equipment firm and a train giant that would combine Alstom's high-speed train operations with Siemens' rolling-stock business.

GE, Siemens face-off today in France over Alstom
General Electric (GE +0.3%) CEO Jeff Immelt will have to convince the French parliament today of his €12B ($17B) bid for Alstom (ALSMY -0.5%). Immelt faces pressure from Siemens France chairman Christophe de Maistre, who will have his own shot at an offer for the electric and rail transport giant.Previously, GE had extended its bid to June 23, although Siemens is already being seen making a rival offer. Reuters suspects that Siemens was readying a formal bid under which it would "transfer its rail activities and less than 7 billion euros in cash to its French rival in exchange for its power assets." Although it is still likely that Siemens will hold onto some of its rail business, as reported last week. May 27, 2014, 10:35 AM | 8 Comments

GE's Immelt says he's confident about sealing the deal for Alstom
GE's (GE +0.4%) Jeff Immelt sounds confident about completing the company's proposed deal for Alstom's (ALSMY) energy assets despite the resistance of the French government, saying "we know what we're doing" and "we wouldn't have started if we didn't think we could finish."But Nomura's Shannon O'Callaghan thinks GE might be better off walking away: The original case for a deal was that Alstom’s cash squeeze created an opportunity for GE to buy core power assets that helped it offer a total plant solution and achieve its targeted industrial/finance earnings mix at a price that made the deal justifiable on cost synergies, but raising the offer price erodes the cost synergy case, while putting existing GE industrial assets into the deal erodes the industrial/finance earnings mix case.Also, Immelt says GE expects to launch the IPO of its North American retail finance business in Q3, a key step in his efforts to shrink the size of GE's finance operation.

Bloomberg: GE seeks ways to woo French government over Alstom
General Electric (GE) is in talks with nuclear-plant manufacturer Areva (ARVCF) and other French companies about asset sales or partnerships as the U.S. conglomerate looks to persuade France's government to support its bid for Alstom's (ALSMY) energy operations, Bloomberg reports.Meanwhile, Siemens (SI) could formally make a rival offer this week in which it would swap its rail business for Alstom's power assets, Reuters reports. The companies would also create a JV in rail signalling, while Siemens could offer to divest Alstom's wind and nuclear-power interests to Areva.However, Alstom wants cash and supports GE's bid, and although it is interested in strengthening its presence in rail signaling, it doesn't want to add to its rolling stock.

GE exec heads to Paris to save Alstom deal
GE is sending a top executive to Paris today as it works to save its deal to buy Alstom's (ALSMY) energy business.GE has some cards to play: CEO Jeff Immelt has offered to consider taking on French investors in Alstom's hydropower unit, to sell Alstom's wind-power unit to French investors and to explore a JV involving Alstom and GE's railroad signaling businesses.But the hard-to-please French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg is backed by a new French decree allowing the government to veto foreign investment in energy, water, transport and other sectors deemed strategic to the country, which may yet put more pressure on GE to modify its deal.GE is still Alstom's only formal suitor, though Siemens (SI) is studying Alstom's books in preparation for a possible bid, and Montebourg has made clear he would favor a European option.

France strengthens hand in battle for Alstom assets
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has signed a decree that extends the state's powers to block foreign takeovers to the energy, water, transport, telecoms and health sectors, with any acquisition in what the government now considers to be "strategic" industries needing the approval of the Economy Minister.The move adds to the government's authority to prevent deals in the nuclear, encryption and vaccines fields.It will also give France more say in the potential sale of Alstom's (ALSMY) energy assets to GE (GE) or Siemens (SI). French Economy Minster Arnaud Montebourg has criticized the GE proposal and advocated a deal with Siemens.The risk is that foreign investors could be further put off from doing business in France at a time that the economy is stagnating.ETF: EWQ May 15, 2014, 5:22 AM | 16 Comments

Investors weigh good news/bad news nature of GE's bid for Alstom assets
GE (GE -0.4%) shares have gained just 1.7% since the news first broke that it was considering a bid for Alstom (ALSMY, AOMFF) energy assets, perhaps reflecting the good news/bad news nature of a potential deal, according to Morgan Stanley's Nigel Coe.The bearish view holds that GE is heavily increasing exposure to a more commoditized area of the power generation spectrum (coal, hydro, transmission), the acquisition of a large European competitor carries significant “clash of culture” risks, and there's the potential for large project write-downs and restructuring programs.On the other hand, coal generation is not going away any time soon with installed base growth comparable to gas over the next 20 years, and the service annuity on Alstom’s substantial installed base of coal and steam turbines accounts for the majority of the transaction value, Coe says.

Iran would buy 400 new commercial jets if sanctions eased
Iran would purchase 400 new aircraft over 10 years if sanctions were lifted, the country's top aviation official reportedly says.

General Electric (GE) expects that China will be "a good source of growth" in 2014 despite increasing concerns about the country's economy, CFO Jeff Bornstein says.GE forecast that it will "grow faster than the Chinese economy," as it serves markets that are priorities for the government.Bornstein's optimism also comes despite GE's industrial sales in China slowing to 7% in 2013 from 20% in 2012, while orders slumped 33% in Q1.Other companies are also confident about their prospects in China, including Honeywell and DuPont.

GE plans to sell more businesses, could cut ops not meeting 10% profit target
GE will be more active on the divestiture front this year, with plans to sell off $4B worth of its sprawling conglomerate and possibly shedding operations that aren't meeting a minimum profit margin target of 10%, CEO Jeff Immelt said in today's earnings call.Profits at GE's industrial business rose 12% Y/Y, with its jet engine and oil and gas businesses delivering strong results, but profit at its energy management business plunged 67% and could see some of its weaker operations sold off, even as it brings in Mark Begor - whom Immelt called a "turnaround guy" for his work running GE Capital's real estate business - to run the operation.S&P Capital IQ reiterated its Buy rating on the stock and raises its target price by $2 to $32, believing that GE's industrial, infrastructure and financial performance will benefit from an expanding U.S. and global economy.

GE Capital seen ripe for more slimming after credit card IPO
As GE starts spinning off its consumer credit card business, some on Wall Street are hoping it eventually will slim down its GE Capital finance unit even further, with commercial real estate - which GE Capital expects to make up 10%-15% of its portfolio in the future - another major potential area for GE to trim.GE Capital does plan to sell off assets in which it holds an equity stake, such as buildings, but it still sees providing financing for commercial real estate properties including refinancings and loans for new buildings as a core function; GE says it's an asset class it knows well, but some analysts, such as Morningstar's Daniel Holland, says, "You have to think really hard about a good reason for them owning that business."Thursday's earnings report from GE presents the next chance for analysts to address the company's strategy.

Warren Buffett's top dividend stocks offer ideas for a defensive posture
Utility stocks are the only group that's been rising regularly in the recent selloff, but another group of stocks that might start to interest buyers: Warren Buffett's top dividend yielding stocks from the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) portfolio.Coca-Cola (KO) is a long-time Berkshire holding, fitting with Buffett's buy and hold forever strategy; the dividend yields 3.15%.Procter & Gamble (PG) is a long-time holding; it just announced another 7% dividend hike and yields 3.18%.Wells Fargo (WFC) is Buffett’s favorite bank and is the largest position in the Berkshire portfolio; while it yields only ~2.4% now, it telegraphed a quarterly dividend raise to $0.35/share for a new yield of 2.87%.Wal-Mart (WMT) has grown to a stake of nearly 50M shares, and it raised its quarterly payout to $0.48/share, generating a new yield of 2.45%.Buffett owns ~40M shares of GM, where the dividend is relatively new but the drop in the stock price now has its yield just above 3.5%.GE was added as a larger stake after Berkshire’s warrant conversions, but the position is still worth only ~$250M; the dividend yields ~3.4%.Buffett still owns 11M shares of ConocoPhillips (COP; 3.94% yield) but has moved more cash into rival Exxon Mobil (XOM; 2.7% yield).

GE may need radical cuts to boost its stock, analyst says
Barclays analyst Scott Davis comes up with a new benchmark for evaluating investor interest in GE: He says 80% of phone calls he received when he began covering GE in 2002 were requests for info about the company, while today the number is barely 5%.For the phone to start ringing more often, Davis thinks GE needs to make bolder decisions and move aggressively to trim its portfolio of businesses, suggesting the company get out of banking, appliances, data centers or any other non-core, non-infrastructure based business.Interest in other conglomerates also has faded, Davis says, concluding that the model of extreme corporate diversity no longer makes sense for investors who can spread risks around on their own via ETFs or other instruments.

FAA tells Boeing to fix 747-8 software to avoid crash

The TBTFs join to fight proposed bank tax
Half a million doesn't buy much anymore. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R, Mich.) - a sizable recipient of Wall Street donations - has the large financial institutions displeased with his proposal to levy a tax on them. He says they deserve to pay up for the lower borrowing costs they receive because of their perceived government backstop, a notion the banks dispute.The proposal is part of larger tax reform expected to get serious discussion after the mid-term elections, and a Camp spokeswoman says the overall plan will make banks "some of the biggest winners."In discussions to hold a fundraiser for the NRC, Goldman Sachs (GS +0.9%) reportedly opted out over its concerns. Smaller bankers join in with their much larger brethren: "We're going to beat this like a rented mule," says Cam Fine, who heads the Independent Community Bankers Association. "This is a united effort."Camp's tax would apply to financial firms with assets greater than $500B, levying a 0.035% tax on total assets each year. Among those affected (in addition to Goldman) are AIG, BAC, C, GE Capital, JPM MET, MS, PRU, and WFC. The largest could pay more than $2B per year under the plan.

GE may be next activist target, Gasparino says

GE consumer credit spinoff could boost multiple
GE's North American retail credit unit is primarily a consumer credit card business and accounted for $9.4B of GE Capital's $44B in revenue in 2013 (GE overall had $146B in revenue). So while it's relatively small, the spinoff (with new name Synchrony Financial SYF) will reduce exposure to the ups and downs of consumer spending, writes Dimitra Defotis in Barron's.By becoming less of a bank - CEO Immelt hopes for GE Capital to account for one-third of earnings next year vs. 40% in 2013 - GE could fetch a higher multiple, he suggests, noting the stock trades at about 15x estimated 2014 earnings vs. a more pure-play industrial player like Danaher at 20x.Earlier coverage Mar. 14, 2014, 11:03 AM
GE's consumer finance IPO is net positive but no game-changer, analyst says
GE's move to IPO its consumer credit card business is a "net positive" for the company but not a panacea, according to Bernstein's Steven Winoker.The analyst thinks GE investors over time will favor the higher industrial earnings weighting, provided management keeps share buyback promises; overall, he believes those earnings deserve a much higher multiple than banking earnings.Still, Winoker is no fan of GE, which he rates as Market Perform with a $28 price target: He thinks the stock looks pricey trading at a 40% premium to tangible book for GE Capital and 17x 2014-15 earnings, and GE Capital likely won’t start growing until 2016.

GE +1.8% as Jeff Immelt spends his entire 2013 cash bonus on shares
CEO Jeff Immelt demonstrates his confidence in GE (GE +1.8%) by investing his entire 2013 cash bonus in GE shares, picking up ~105K shares yesterday for more than $2.64M and following a purchase of 40K shares last week for ~$1M.However, it's a relatively small portion of the 1.9M shares Immelt owns directly in GE; “considering he’s been the CEO for about a decade and been paid a lot of money, that’s not particularly impressive,” says Alan Johnson, head of a compensation consulting firm.Chief executives sometimes spend their own money on company stock as a way to shore up investor confidence; it's worked for at least a day, and GE investors hope for a repeat of Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman's 2012 purchase of 100K shares that's netted him ~$1M in paper profit.

Study names 26 firms that paid no income tax for five years
Twenty-six out of 288 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid no federal income tax between 2008 and 2012, a report from the left-leaning activist group Citizens for Tax Justice shows.The firms include Boeing (BA), GE (GE), and Verizon Communications (VZ).The study adds that 111 firms paid no federal income tax in at least one of the five years.However, GE and other companies named dispute the report's findings. "For each year cited by Citizens for Tax Justice, GE paid income taxes in the U.S., as well as billions in other state, local and federal taxes in the U.S.," GE said.Boeing said its total effective 2013 tax rate was 26.4%, while Verizon said it paid over $2.9B in income taxes from 2008-2012.CTJ's report comes as GOP House member David Camp gets set to introduce an overhaul of the tax code.

GE moves closer to IPO of GE Capital
GE is expected to file for the IPO of its consumer finance unit - GE Capital - in the next two months, reports the FT, and has hired Goldman and JPMorgan to lead the push.The unit could be valued at more than $20B and the sale of about 20% means a $4B listing and the largest IPO since Facebook raised $16.1B in May 2012. The remainder of the unit would be spun off to GE shareholders in 2015.Back in the day, cynics could call GE a bank that happened to sell aircraft parts and such, but no more. The exit from consumer finance would be the completion of a post-crisis restructuring plan to return to the company's manufacturing roots.The GE Capital sale would be the latest in a fast line of consumer finance offerings, including the IPOs of Santander Consumer U.S. and Springleaf Financial.

Double-dip: GE buys Cameron unit, Citi removes from Focus List
Investors didn't seem too thrilled with GE's $550M purchase yesterday of Cameron's (CAM) reciprocating compression division, sending GE shares more than 1% lower today.For CAM, Sterne Agee views the asset sale (and likely additional sales) as positive but believes execution of its core businesses will be the key to success in 2014; while asset sales could prompt some modest downside to its 2014-15 EPS estimates of $3.90 and $5.00, the firm sees CAM's aggressive approach to buying back stock in Q4 indicating confidence in its operations and execution.Citigroup removes GE from its Focus List, not because of the purchase but due to its earnings: GE unexpectedly fell 10 bps short of its 2013 target of 70 bps of operating margin growth, normally not a big deal "but since GE does not provide EPS guidance, this target had become a disproportionally key 2013 milestone in GE’s road to a transformational mix of 70/30 industrial/capital."

GE again falls short in consistently meeting its own financial targets
GE missed a key margin target touted by CEO Jeff Immelt last year: While Q4 profit climbed 4.8% thanks to improved sales of power turbines and airplane engines, GE fell short in its pledge to improve the operating profit margin in its industrial businesses.Four weeks ago, Immelt said GE was "on track" in its goal of improving its industrial operating margin by 70 bps last year; to achieve the goal, it aggressively cut costs, trimming $1.6B of expenses last year and planning another $1B cut this year, but the end result was a 66-point improvement.The margin goal has proven troublesome for a while: GE pared its target in 2012, pledging to make up the difference in 2013, and says it was on track until it was hit in Q4 by a quality problem with its wind turbine blades and issues related to marine power systems at its energy management unit (conference call).

EPA's new carbon rules hurt coal, could accelerate shift to natural gas
Both critics and supporters of the new EPA draft regulations on CO2 emissions agree on one thing: This will be the final blow to many proposed coal plants.The truth is, U.S. coal generation already was in decline not because of climate regulations, but because of good ol' free-market capitalism; the boom in natural gas production has dramatically increased supplies, sent prices plummeting and prompted a shift away from coal.Among potential long-term winners: U.S. nat gas drillers such as CHK and XOM, drilling services firms such as HAL and BHI, pipeline companies such as SE and KMI, makers of gas-fired turbines such as GE and SI, power generators such as NRG and CPN if electricity prices rise.Likely losers: Coal appears headed for a decline, and companies with large Appalachian operations such as JRCC and ANR could suffer most as more coal comes from cheaper-to-access deposits in the Illinois Basin and Wyoming; big industrial companies, which have used low U.S. power prices as a competitive advantage, are concerned.ETFs: KOL, IDU, PUI, XLU, VPU, RYU, FXU, PSCU, UPW, SDP, UTLT.

GE is close to securing a nearly $2B sale to Algeria of turbines for six power plants, WSJ reports, in what would be a major contract win for GE's struggling power-turbine business.GE has been negotiating with Algerian gas and power company Sonelgaz after being named preferred bidder earlier this year to supply more than 8 GW of power, and is said to be awaiting final approval from the government.Generator sales have been weak since the recession sapped power demand; GE received orders for just eight turbines globally this Q1 and 24 in Q2.

Screening for dividend growth names
Dividend payers may be a good place to hide out from rising interest rates, but those stocks sporting the highest yields - telecoms and utilities - tend to have slow payment growth, making them less-attractive as rates rise. Checking back to the 1994 bond bear market, telecoms and utilities were among the market's worst performers.Better to shop for modest payers, but above-average payment growth. Barron's screens for those characteristics combined with reasonable overall valuation and turns up three names: Boeing (BA), CVS Caremark (CVS), and GE.Certain dividend ETFs employ this strategy as well, with Vanguard's Dividend Appreciation (VIG) - almost zero exposure to telecoms and utilities  - and WisdomTree's U.S. Dividend Growth ETF (DGRW) coming to mind. Others include DGRS, DNL, EMDG, DGRE.Other dividend ETFs: FDL, FVD, MDIV, QDF, QDYN, QDEF, DIV, CVY, DVY, HDV, IYLD, PEY, PFM, SCHD, SDY, SDYL, DVYL, VYM, DHS, DTD, SYLD, KBWD, SPHD, DLN, DON, HILO.Telecom and utility ETFs: IYZ, XTL, VOX, LTL, TLL, IDU, PUI, XLU, VPU, RYU, FXU, PSCU, UPW, SDP, UTLT.

Bloomberg: GE may target Dresser-Rand, Dril-Quip in energy push
GE's growing interest in oil and gas assets and a decade-high $19.3B cash stockpile are turning Dresser-Rand (DRC) and Dril-Quip (DRQ) into potential takeover targets, analysts say.DRQ is projected to boost sales by 63% in the next three years, faster than all but two similar-sized U.S. peers, and analysts see DRC expanding 51%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.DRQ, with visible multi-year growth in front of it, "is always at the top of the list of companies that are talked about as a consolidation target,” a Lazard Capital analyst says, but a deal with GE might be viewed by regulators as anti-competitive.

Ignore the slowdown in China at your own peril, writes Ben Levisohn after GDP growth slipped to 7.5% in Q2, and Beijing shows little sign of easing policy to re-boost it. Consumer staples and health care stocks with high China exposure like Mead Johnson (MJN) and PerkinElmer (PKI) have recently underperformed (on a relative basis), but also at risk are those in materials, industrials, and IT with a heavy reliance on China: DOW, ALTR, EXPD, GE. On the other hand there's Las Vegas Sands (LVS) - maybe unfairly (relatively) punished for its Macau exposure even as the secular growth of gambling there should offset any cyclical economic weakness in China.

Goldman Sachs lifts its forecasts for the S&P 500 (SPY), as David Kostin and company now say they expect the index to gain 5% by year-end to 1,750, 9% to 1,900 in 2014, and 10% to 2,100 in 2015. The rationale: expectations of above-trend real GDP growth beginning next year (Mr. Evans' "escape velocity" ?) coupled with P/E multiple expansion to 16x. Furthermore, dividends should rise ~30% over the next two years, bolstering the firm's claim that dividend-paying equities (DVY) are one of the only places U.S. investors can look to for income-generation.

It's also of interest to gun manufacturers Smith & Wesson (SWHC +0.8%) and Sturn Ruger (RGR -0.8%) - wallowing around with relatively low P-E ratios with future demand tough to forecast.

GE (GE) is the Dow's biggest loser today, falling 2.2% to $21.26 after JPMorgan cuts its rating on the conglomerate to neutral from overweight and lowers its price target to $22 from $24.

JPMorgan downgrades General Electric (GE -0.8%) to Neutral from Overweight.

Tusa also asked Jeff Immelt about weakness in oil and gas on the call, and now says he no longer values GE Industrial at a premium. The stock is "dead money near term," Tusa notes. (transcript)

GE's planned purchase of pump maker Lufkin (LUFK) at the industry’s most expensive price tag highlights demand for oilfield equipment that may spark takeover interest from large-cap oilfield servicers for Weatherford (WFT), Flotek (FTK) and Tesco (TESO), Bloomberg writes. Even after WFT surged yesterday on the Lufkin news, its $18B enterprise value still equals just 7.3x trailing 12-month EBITDA.

Apr. 9, 2013, 11:47 AM
Analyst reaction to GE's $3.3B purchase of Lufkin (LUFK) is decidedly mixed, with some calling the price "stunning" while others believe the premium is worth it since GE is paying for growth prospects; LUFK’s revenue rose 37% in 2012. But GE does not have a history of driving hard bargains; after years of decent but not big returns from its energy spending spree, shareholders might want to temper their optimism.

GE (GE) and Comcast (CMCSA) make it official, announcing a $30B agreement to shift control of NBC Universal from GE to the Comcast. Details as expected: Comcast will control 51% of the new entity, for which it will pay $6B in cash and throw in its content assets. GE kicks in NBCU along with $9B in debt, and will buy out Vivendi's (VIVDY.PK) 20% stake in NBCU for $5.8B. (PR)

GE and Comcast (CMCSA) plan to announce their deal for NBC Universal tomorrow, WSJ reports. Comcast would head a new joint venture that will include the NBC TV network, more than a dozen cable nets and Universal Studios (the studio and the parks). Dec. 2, 2009, 3:16 PM
GE (GE) will delay paying Vivendi (VIVDY.PK) cash for its $5.8B purchase of Vivendi's stake in NBC Universal, sources say. Vivendi will only get its money once the Comcast (CMCSA) deal closes, which could take more than a year due to regulatory reviews. If the deal doesn't close by late 2010, Vivendi could be entitled to a payment of up to $2B from GE. Dec. 2, 2009, 8:23 AM
Comcast (CMCSA) may have to put up less cash to take control of NBC Universal, as the cable giant and GE have reportedly valued Comcast's cable channels at $6.5B-7B. Alternately, Comcast could take a greater portion of the venture's cash flow. The companies value NBCU's assets at near $30B. (GE, Vivendi come to terms) Dec. 1, 2009, 2:36 PM
GE (GE) and Vivendi (VIVDY.PK) come together on a tentative $5.8B deal for Vivendi's 20% stake in NBC Universal - roughly in between the two firms' last best offers. A finalized deal would clear the key obstacle to selling a majority share in the network to Comcast (CMCSA). Nov. 30, 2009, 8:21 PM

GE (GE) "strongly disagrees with the premise" it is selling off assets in a desparate attempt to raise cash. But looking at recent deals, and GE's effort to dump NBC Universal's $2B in debt by selling it into a JV at way below market value, Daniel Fisher can't help but wonder: What then?

As Vivendi (VIVDY.PK) and GE consider an IPO for Vivendi's NBC Universal stake that could scuttle a sale of the network to Comcast (CMCSA), Lacey Rose says the only thing worse than the deal is no deal at all. The three companies need the tie-up to happen; Vivendi's likely gouging as much as it can before freeing itself from the network. Nov. 25, 2009, 2:03 PM

GE Capital (GE +0.6%) continues to stabilize, JP Morgan says, predicting a dramatic narrowing in losses over the long-term. "The several 'hot spots' in the GECS portfolio have now been reduced to one," CRE, firm says. "In total, management continues to see provisions a bit better than the adverse case, which makes a capital contribution beyond the fixed charge coverage requirement in 1Q 2011 unlikely."

With right of first refusal, GE is reportedly leaning toward allowing an IPO of Vivendi's (VIVDY.PK) stake in NBC Universal, as talks over selling the unit to Comcast (CMCSA) stall.

Talks between GE Corp. (GE) and Vivendi have reportedly ground to a halt as the two clash over how to assess the worth of NBC Universal, with a price difference of several hundred million dollars separating them. GE and Comcast (CMCSA) had hoped to announce a deal as early as Monday, but sources say this could now be at least a week away, or perhaps not at all if Vivendi decides to pursue an IPO of its 20% stake in NBCU rather than sell it back to GE.

Vivendi's (VIVDY.PK) CFO says the company has no plans to be part of the future JV that Comcast (CMCSA) and General Electric (GE) are discussing. Selling its 20% percent stake in NBCU would give Vivendi "additional financial headroom" after it gained control of Brazil's telecoms operator GVT last week, he said, but cautioned, "we are not there yet."

Big exporters form coalition to support Republican border tax
Leading U.S. exporters launch a coalition in support of a House Republican plan for a "border adjustment" tax on all imports.The "American Made Coalition" includes more than 25 U.S. companies, including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL)."American workers and businesses are not competing today on a level playing field with foreign competitors because of an outdated and unfair tax system," says a spokesperson for the group.The group's launch underscores a division in corporate America over the proposal that would cut corporate income tax to 20% from 35%, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20% tax on imports.Retailers, oil refiners and foreign automakers have been lobbying against any big tax on imports, which they say would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products.

GE is proposing an investment in Nigeria's oil refineries, potentially convening a consortium of companies to improve capacity at the run-down facilities, which also are subject to frequent pipeline attacks.GE's plan and similar promises from companies such as Eni to work with Nigeria to rehabilitate the country's three oil refineries could help the government as it tries to reduce costly imported oil products.Nigeria's Minister of State for Petroleum Resources has said that Chevron and Total also were interested in working on the refineries.

GE's Q4 disappoints but Immelt "pretty secure" about 2017 growth target
GE tumbled 2.2% in today's trade as Q4 revenue fell 2.4% Y/Y, with organic revenue in industrial businesses sliding 1% and coming in below the company's 0%-2% growth forecast and after having to reduce revenue forecasts throughout the year.Analysts question whether the Q4 results could mean GE will miss the 2017 target of 3%-5% growth that the company reaffirmed today, but with Alstom revenue included - as it will be in future quarters - hitting the revenue target "doesn't look like a stretch," says RBC analyst Deane Dray.Noting GE's overall organic revenue rose 4% in the quarter, CEO Jeffrey Immelt said in today's earnings conference call that felt "pretty secure" about the 2017 target.Q4 revenue in GE's oil and gas business sank 22%, but the decline was expected amid weak market conditions.GE’s Q4 industrial operating cash flow of $8.2B made it the "biggest cash quarter in our history,” Immelt said.Bloomberg's Brooke Sutherland writes hopefully that GE stands to benefit from tax reform and plans for infrastructure stimulus, and the stock's gains have not kept pace with the broader post-election rally, indicating some skepticism may have been baked in and leaving some room to rise.

Pentair, Roper upgraded at J.P. Morgan on Trump effect; GE a "top avoid"
Pentair (PNR +2.1%) and Roper Technologies (ROP +0.9%) are upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at J.P. Morgan, which believes the stocks have not received as much as credit as other electrical equipment and multi-industry stocks for anticipated Trump-related benefits.On PNR, given low expectations set in October and less stock appreciation due to an already low tax rate, the firm sees potential for relative upside to organic growth in a better economy and less downside in a sluggish/steady-state economy, all at an attractive discount.JPM downgrades TriMas (TRS +0.7%) to Neutral from Overweight, citing valuation following the stock's outperformance over the last three months; the firm also reiterates Honeywell (HON +0.5%), Ingersoll-Rand (IR +1%) and Danaher (DHR +0.3%) at Overweight, and Rockwell Automation (ROK +0.8%) at Underweight while naming General Electric (GE -0.2%) a "top avoid," expecting core operating performance to track below plan driven by weak fundamentals.

Alstom prevails in dispute with GE over $800M train signal contract
A U.S. district judge rules that Alstom may ask an independent accounting firm to resolve a dispute over the company's $800M purchase of General Electric's (NYSE:GE) train signaling business, rejecting GE's bid for arbitration.The judge said the "plain language" of the 2014 sales contract justified letting Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu handle the matter first, rather than arbitrators from the International Chamber of Commerce.Alstom had sued GE for breach of contract for refusing to let the accounting firm decide whether the purchase price should be adjusted up or down to account for working capital and net debt.

Even 0% tax rate won't help GE, J.P. Morgan analyst says
General Electric (GE +0.6%) opens higher even as J.P. Morgan reiterates its Underweight rating and $28 price target on the shares, as analyst Stephen Tusa says the company's fundamentals are more negative than he envisioned a year ago.GE bulls anticipate a favorable tax environment for the company under a Trump administration, but Tusa believes that even at zero, the tax impact for GE is only slightly more positive than the average for its peer group, given the limited benefits from a tax repatriation.”Fundamentally, we see more downside than upside" for GE, and fundamentals "will matter more than any one-time step up," Tusa writes.

GE deals may point toward possible succession
Dealmaking at General Electric (GE -0.4%) could point the way toward a possible line of succession, suggests Rob Cox, noting that merging with Alstom and Baker Hughes provides some clues to the company's path forward.Jeff Immelt doesn't have current plans to retire, but is 60, opening up investor speculation.Meanwhile, an Alstom deal suggests that Steve Bolze (in charge of the power division) may be in pole position. "Shortly after absorbing Alstom, GE more than doubled its targeted cost savings from the French company to $3 billion," Cox notes. "If these pan out over the next year or two, Mr. Bolze will be hard to beat for Mr. Immelt’s seat."Lorenzo Simonelli, who leads the oil and gas division integrating Baker Hughes, isn't far behind: "It is a complicated arrangement that presents a dramatic new blueprint should GE one day abandon its conglomerate structure."

Analyst reaction mixed following GE's $2 earnings target for 2018
Analysts are cautiously optimistic that General Electric (GE -1%) can achieve its earnings goal after the company reaffirmed its $2/share target for 2018 and offered a "high bar" forecast for revenue gains of 3%-5% next year.Goldman Sachs analyst Jon Ritchie maintains his Neutral rating and $31 price target, saying it is more positive on GE's margin trajectory and the progress on reorienting the company (digital, divesting non-core assets), but seeing downside to GE's 2018 EPS target and viewing current valuation as reasonable for a stock with below average EBIT growth over 2016-18.Barclays rates GE at Outperform and lifts its stock price target to $36 from $32, even as "numbers this year have just been OK, cash generation light, and the ramp to 2018 numbers is steep."Raising its target price to $37 from $36, RBC says it liked hearing that GE still has ~$10B of "unallocated" leverage capacity.

GE eyes sale of two smaller industrial units, another $1B in cost cuts
More from GE's analyst day: The company says it plans to raise $4B by selling two of its smaller industrial units and promises to cut another $1B in expenses.GE expects to sell its Industrial Solutions business, which supplies equipment to the electrical distribution and grid industries, and its GE Water business; the two units combined account for ~$5B in annual revenue.CEO Jeffrey Immelt says GE will be seeking ways to cut costs in the short run by shrinking its footprint and closing some facilities, the type of corporate actions that have triggered backlash from Pres.-elect Trump.Immelt also says GE has grown its foreign businesses twice as much as its domestic business over the last 15 years, and has sold 85% of its jet engines and gas-fired power turbines overseas.Earlier: General Electric reaffirms 2016-17 earnings guidance Dec. 14, 2016, 5:58 PM | 38 Comments

EMR, FTV, MMM, DHR poised to win from Trump’s lower taxes, analyst says
U.S.-based industrial companies such as Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Fortive (NYSE:FTV), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR) could enjoy sizable benefits from potential tax changes that could occur next year, as well as increased capital spending, Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker writes.The potential EPS upside of U.S. tax reform should reach double digits for the four companies, while Eaton (NYSE:ETN) - already at a group-low ~10% global effective tax rate - should see only minimal upside, according to Winoker, who notes that tax deductibility of capex investment also would spark spending in the U.S.Bernstein's covered companies derive between 10% (3M) and 60%-plus (Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK)) of revenues from customers’ capex spending, so the impact could be meaningful; the firm rates Allegion (NYSE:ALLE), DHR, Dover (NYSE:DOV), FTV, Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR), Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Pentair (NYSE:PNR) at Outperform, with EMR, ETN, General Electric (NYSE:GE), Idex (NYSE:IEX), MMM and ROK at Market Perform.

The combination of General Electric's (GE +0.8%) oil and gas business with Baker Hughes (BHI +0.4%) has the potential to challenge Schlumberger (SLB +0.2%), but "it's a long-term game," Bernstein analysts say.Following yesterday’s investor meeting, the Bernstein boys say they are more convinced by the merger's long-term potential but remain cautious on delivery timing; while the long-term potential and revenue enhancement concepts dominated the meeting, the firm says little information was revealed on timing beyond the already published synergy estimates.Bernstein agrees conceptually with management that GE-BHI will challenge SLB for large-scale, integrated, at-risk projects and leadership of new commercial models in E&P, but expects implementation will prove more challenging than conveyed at the investor meeting.

GE a top pick at Stifel with or without Trump bump
Stifel analysts say they are “fundamentally cautious” on industrial stocks but call General Electric (GE -0.3%) and Ingersoll-Rand (IR +0.9%) their top picks among their Buy-rated stocks in the group in both a base case slow-and-steady low-growth environment as well as a pro-growth Trump rally.The firm considers GE a solid, quality defensive play with an attractive 3% yield and likely would be a prime beneficiary of a Trump bump, but also a strong defensive component in its aftermarket/services stream, which accounts for ~45% of revenues and 80% of profits.Stifel says the Baker Hughes should effectively de-risk GE’s oil and gas exposure and allow management to pursue large scale restructuring of a $30B business while providing additional balance sheet flexibility going forward.

GE Power sees little sales impact even if U.S. quits climate deals
Sales of power plant upgrades by General Electric (NYSE:GE) would not suffer much even if the U.S. bails out of climate change treaties under a Trump administration, Paul McElhinney, CEO of GE's power services business, tells Reuters.Utilities still want the economic benefits that come with modernizations, McElhinney says, predicting "very robust" demand for products that can lower emissions and increase efficiency.GE, which supports climate agreements, says global CO2 emissions could be cut by 10%, or 1.1M metric tons/year, if current technology to boost the efficiency of coal and gas-fired power plants were installed in every plant now operating; the company says such upgrades cost ~55M for a coal plant and $10M for a natural gas plant.GE expects to land contracts worth ~$500M in the coming weeks, McElhinney says.

GE, ADM among JPMorgan's stocks to short in 2017
JPMorgan is out with its top stock picks for 2017, but as Jack Hough of Barron's points out, the "shorts" list is far more interesting because Sell recommendations from the sell-side are so much rarer than Buys.Of the 14-name shorts list, nine have price targets 10% or more below the current level.GE has 10% potential downside thanks to its too-rich valuation relative to free cash flow versus peers.Federated Investors (NYSE:FII) could fall 14% thanks to its exposure to the struggling active-management industry.Trucker C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) has 16% downside as favorable contracts reset to depressed industry levels.Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) has a price target 18% below the current value as a strong dollar and trade troubles with Mexico crimp profits.A 45% price decline could be in store for driller Forum Energy Technologies (NYSE:FET), with good assets and a healthy balance sheet, but way too fancy of a valuation.There's also Intelsat (NYSE:I), which JPMorgan says could be a zero as new competition squeezes the heavily leveraged company.Other shorts: Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD), Ensco (NYSE:ESV).

Dow Jones: SEC completes review of GE non-GAAP measures, takes no action
The SEC has criticized GE's use of tailored, non-GAAP financial measures in recent months, but has completed a review of the company's filings without taking any action, Dow Jones reports, citing documents the agency has made public.GE reportedly defended its non-GAAP disclosures as helpful and relevant to investors, but told the SEC it would revise the disclosures to address the agency's concerns.Critics say non-GAAP measures can be abused to make companies look healthier than they are, and the SEC issued new guidelines in May to clarify to companies when it might frown on the use of non-GAAP measures.

BP, GE team up on oilfield data technology
BP (BP +1.4%) signs a deal to use a new digital solution by General Electric (GE -0.5%) to improve the efficiency and safety of its offshore oil platforms by predicting equipment breakdowns before they occur; financial terms were not disclosed.BP says GE's Plant Operations Advisor software, which will gather data from various pieces of oilfield equipment and process it through GE's Predix software, should help it save more than $200M/year from its deployment at up to 33 platforms globally, and estimates the program will boost its efficiency by 2%-4%.GE hopes the BP partnership will set up future opportunities across the oil industry, especially ahead of the merger of its oil and gas division with Baker Hughes.

DoE to sell uranium to potential GE-Hitachi Kentucky enrichment facility
The Department of Energy agrees to sell depleted uranium from the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant to enrich at a potential $1B state-of-the-art facility in Kentucky, which would be built and operated by GE-Hitachi's Global Laser Enrichment, according to a local report.Global Laser Enrichment has not made a formal decision to proceed with licensing or construction of the facility.GLE is 62.5% owned by GE-Hitachi, which is 60% owned by General Electric and 40% by Hitachi, resulting in indirect interests in GLE of 37.5% by GE and 25% by Hitachi.GE also has a direct interest of 13.5% IN GLE, resulting in a direct and indirect ownership of 51%, meeting a U.S. requirement that nuclear facilities be majority owned by a U.S. company; the remaining 24% is held by Canadian uranium producer Cameco (NYSE:CCJ).

Buy Baker Hughes now that the GE dust has settled, Guggenheim says
It's time to buy Baker Hughes (BHI -0.2%) now that the dust has settled regarding the company's merger with General Electric's (GE +0.6%) oil and gas business, Guggenheim analysts say.Guggenheim estimates the new company will generate $4.9B in EBITDA in 2018 - a bit less than the $5.2B-$5.5B forecast by the companies - and should trade at a peer average 10.6x EBITDA, implying a fair value for BHI of ~$63, but the firm believes synergies provide another ~$4 of upside if GE is able to realize greater cost savings.The firm also finds the industrial logic is sound: As Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) has shown, regional and product line diversity enhance through-cycle returns and cash flow, which are benefits that the new BHI should be able to realize as a result of its pro forma portfolio.

Failed GE jet engine in O’Hare fire had manufacturing defect, NTSB says
A GE engine on an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) plane that exploded on a runway at O'Hare airport in Chicago a week ago had an apparent manufacturing defect, the National Transportation Safety Board said today.A disk within the CF6-80 engine had an “internal inclusion,” meaning foreign debris was embedded within the special alloy designed to withstand the heat and high stresses of a jet engine, the NTSB said.While the agency has not reached a conclusion about whether the flaw may be present in other engines, GE says it has not suffered such a failure in parts made with the same alloy in more than 30 years; GE says more than 4K of the various CF6 engines are in service and have flown more than 400M hours.

GE-Baker Hughes deal strikes right balance, Citi says
Citigroup analysts believe the deal between General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) strikes a good balance for GE and BHI, as GE is not selling at the bottom, valuation seems fair for BHI shareholders, and GE management retains control to roll out its digital and service focus across a much broader oil and gas platform.Citi views the deal (I, II, III) favorably, as it "reflects deployment of a meaningful portion of the ~$20B in incremental leverage GE had noted as available for transactions over the next few years," but valuation is reasonable and "the deal enhances [GE]’s visibility to EPS growth over the next several years."The firm also notes BHI’s weak stock showing, likely given concerns that GE’s "non-cash contribution to the deal (in the form of 37.5% of GE oil and gas) doesn’t provide enough value to Baker Hughes shareholders – we think that concern will diminish over time" given the improved competitive and cost position of the combined company.Simmons analyst Bill Herbert cites another likely reason for BHI's 6.3% swoon in today's trade: The new partnership leaves the company more leveraged to deepwater and international projects, which are not as flexible as the U.S. onshore business.

GE to sell its water business even as it raises bet on oil and gas
Almost as an afterthought in unveiling the merger of its oil and gas unit with Baker Hughes, General Electric (GE -0.1%) said it would sell its GE Water business, a move WSJ's Spencer Jakab calls "self-preservation."Both the water and the oil and gas businesses have been disappointing for GE, Jakab writes, but dumping the water business may be a matter of the number of losers that CEO Jeffrey Immelt can justify to activists such as Trian Fund: "Water might have paid off in the long run... but with GE raising its bet on oil, water just didn’t fit into the mix."Elsewhere, Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker says the deal with Baker Hughes is “positive strategically” for GE shareholders, and is an attractive structure for GE, noting that without requiring a full cash outlay for BHI, the new company provides GE shareholders with additional upside to an oil price recovery.Evercore analysts note the deal likely provides an avenue for GE to promote the widespread adoption of its Predix industrial internet platform, a focal point of the company’s long term strategy.Moody’s keeps its A1 credit rating for GE, saying increased exposure in oil and gas initially is credit negative but will pay out over an extended time horizon.

Baker Hughes, GE shares head in opposite directions as deal sinks in
Baker Hughes (BHI -1%) erases opening gains to trade in the red, while General Electric (GE +0.9%) is higher amid plans to combine their oil and gas operations.The new company will be 62.5% owned by GE, with GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli serving as President and CEO; GE will fund a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50/share, or $7.4B, to existing BHI shareholders, who will own 37.5% of the new company.The deal creates a company with more than $32B in FY 2015 revenue that could cut costs to better compete with rivals such as Schlumberger (SLB -0.9%) to provide equipment and services to oil rigs and wells; the $32B combined revenue places the new company only 8%-9% behind SLB.The combined companies expect to generate $1.6B of synergies by 2020, primarily driven by cost savings; GE expects the deal to be accretive to 2018 EPS by $0.04 and 2020 EPS by $0.08.Analysts see a high likelihood of the deal's completion given little product overlap outside of the Artificial Lift business and the relatively smaller size of the deal vs. the rejected Halliburton-Baker Hughes (HAL -0.5%) tie-up.Moody’s, Fitch and S&P all affirmed GE’s credit ratings with stable outlooks following the announcement.

WSJ: GE, Baker Hughes could reach deal as soon as next week

End of U.S. nuclear industry seen without help from subsidies, Carlyle says
Nuclear power will come to an end in the U.S. if the industry fails to obtain more government support, Carlyle Group predicts.U.S. nuclear reactors need more subsidies to keep running, such as a federal carbon tax that would reward them for their zero-emissions power, according to Bob Mancini, co-head of Carlyle's power unit.Mancini points to measures approved in New York as an example of the kind of help nuclear power plant owners will need to survive; in August, NY state regulators cleared ~$500M/year in subsidies as part of a clean energy plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Relevant tickers include EXC, ETR, DUK, D, NEE, SO, PCG, ED, EIX, AEP, PPL, DTE, FE, NRG, PNM, POR, SCG, WR, XEL, LNT, GE, URA, NLR Oct. 26, 2016, 1:22 PM | 48 Comments

Honeywell's weak guidance surprise spooks investors in industrial shares
“This is the bottom” for Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) businesses exposed to the oil and gas industries, but troubles in the business jet industry “will get worse” next year, CEO David Cote said Friday, a day after the company cut its earnings and sales forecast, causing shares to slide 7.5% in their worst showing in five years."This was a surprise," says William Blair's Nick Heymann, as HON had been considered a safe-haven stock amid sluggish industrial growth, on Cote's reputation and record of delivering on profit targets.Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe compared HON’s announcement to a “paella bowl” dropped in front of investors and said “credibility is becoming a growing issue.”Other analysts are more confident: J.P. Morgan's Steve Tusa says "it's not that bad in the grand scheme," noting that HON’s profits are off ~5% YTD, roughly in line with its industrial peers.“While this quarter and maybe next quarter look to be a little bit worse than anticipated, we still believe they’re well positioned long term to benefit from growth opportunities," according to Edward Jones' Jeff WIndau.HON supplies parts to Textron (NYSE:TXT) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), which fell a respective 3.6% and 0.8% yesterday, while aerospace parts makers Heico (NYSE:HEI), B/E Aerospace (NASDAQ:BEAV) and TransDigm (NYSE:TDG) each slid more than 1%; also, GE slipped 0.6%, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 1.5%, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) lost 0.4%.

New York AG says EPA should not approve GE’s Hudson River cleanup
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is asking the EPA not to approve GE's $1.6B cleanup of the upper Hudson River, saying the agency has not proven whether dredging the river is working.The AG's office says the EPA should delay awarding a certificate of completion to GE for the work, and instead should conduct new studies of fish in the Hudson to determine how much of GE’s pollution remains in the river and how long it will be before humans can safely eat fish from the river again.GE says New York officials approved and oversaw “every major decision about the dredging project,” and that tests for PCBs in the upper Hudson have shown “significant declines” since seven years of dredging ended last October.

Cracked engine blade led to Southwest emergency landing last month
An engine failure on a Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) last month released debris that tore a 5"x16" hole in the plane before it made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Fla., crash investigators at the NTSB said today.In an update to its probe of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737's rare engine failure, the U.S. agency said a fan blade separated from the engine and was not recovered, except for the base of the blade that was still attached to the aircraft; the investigation update still has not solved the precise cause of the "uncontained" engine failure.The Aug. 27 flight, bound from New Orleans to Orlando with 99 passengers and five crew members aboard, lost cabin pressure and safely diverted to Pensacola; there were no injuries.LUV and GE, which produced the engine with Safran in a CFM International joint venture, says they are working closely with the NTSB on the probe.

GE closes lower after 3-D deals, as analysts see few short-term benefits
GE's $1.4B purchase of a pair of 3D-printer companies sent stocks in the group soaring in today's trade, with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) closing +5.5%, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) +3.7%, Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) +4.6% and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) +5.8%.But GE closed 0.7% lower, as analysts say that while 3D printing is promising, GE’s acquisitions are a “net negative” because there are relatively few short-term benefits.“This seems like a relatively outsized and expensive bet, with no near-term return, and an incremental opportunity cost when considering the ongoing debate around what we view as finite balance sheet capacity,” says J.P. Morgan's Steve Tusa.Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna takes a longer view, saying that “while the deals appear pricey, they help position GE to lead, implement and control additive manufacturing processes that will become important cost-reduction levers long term in Aviation and elsewhere."As for the 3-D companies, Citigroup’s Kenneth Wong says that while the GE deal does not present any immediate competition for them, it does not necessarily suggest any buyout implications for the companies since GE is focusing on metal applications.

GE seeks more Brazil wind turbines, but weak economy hurting power demand
General Electric (GE -0.5%) plans to install 500 wind turbines in Brazil next year, bringing its installations there to 2,600, or 37% of the country’s expected 2017 total, but is having difficulty closing new contracts amid the country’s economic slump, according to Jean-Claude Fernand Robert, GE’s head of wind in Latin America.Robert believes the economic crisis in Brazil is "a phase," but the weak economy has hurt demand for power, driving down interest in new power supply deals; Brazil has planned three power auctions this year, compared with seven last year, an April auction saw no bids offered for wind farm contracts.Brazil needs to add ~2 GW/year of power to support existing turbine factories and other suppliers, GE says.GE is Brazil’s top wind turbine supplier, and its turbines account for 40% of the country’s installed wind capacity, based on megawatts.

Reuters: Siemens, Gamesa reject bids from GE for wind power JV

Federal offshore chief warns drillers to find solution to subsea bolt failures
The U.S. government's top offshore drilling regulator is warning subsea oil drillers and equipment makers that bolt failures in the Gulf of Mexico could result in an oil spill on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.Regulators and makers of oil production equipment - including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) - are trying to determine what is causing the problems, which have been found over the past four years on safety equipment in underwater oil production, including on blowout preventers, which are designed as a last defense against a major oil spill such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident.The offshore drilling industry had discussed possibly replacing all the bolts in question in the Gulf over a period of years, but Brian Salerno, director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, says the discussions have ended after a better understanding of the problem.GE issued a global recall after its bolts on a piece of undersea equipment in the Gulf of Mexico failed in 2012, an incident that was reported to the government, but government officials say many more were not, masking the extent of the problem.

New York says GE’s Hudson River cleanup still not adequate
General Electric's (NYSE:GE) seven-year, $1.6B dredging campaign to remove industrial pollutants from the Hudson River has been inadequate, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation says in a letter urging the federal EPA to closely scrutinize the effectiveness of dredging in its project review due to be released by April 2017.At least 136 acres of river bottom and 35% of the PCBs discharged from a pair of GE factories along the Hudson near Albany have not been removed, the state agency says, adding that it has asked permission from the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Champlain Canal, which runs into and at times is a channel of the upper Hudson.New York's move could pose a new PCB-related headache for GE, which has been eager to move past the cleanup obligations that have long dogged the company.

GE's plan to take on $20B more debt could pressure ratings, Moody's says
General Electric's (GE +0.3%) plan to take on $20B of debt could pressure the company's credit ratings despite its operational strengths, Moody's says.The prospect of additional debt is the latest sign that GE is "consciously shifting toward a credit profile that is more fully levered and typical of other large industrial peers... compounded by the ballooning debt-like pension deficit GE is already facing, further elevating leverage," the ratings agency says.Moody's downgraded GE's senior unsecured debt rating to A1 in April 2015 due to concerns about the company's now more industrial-focused, less diverse collection of businesses; reduced resiliency of cash flows and earnings; and a shift to more aggressive shareholder return policies.

It's targeting $200B in sales, which it largely expects to complete by the end of the year, with dividends of $35B headed to GE from GE Capital. Aug. 12, 2016, 4:42 PM | 15 Comments

GE trending toward disappointing earnings through 2018, J.P. Morgan warns
GE shares slumped another 1.3% in today's trade to their lowest levels this month after J.P. Morgan issued a bearish note warning that GE's Q3 is trending well below initial estimates ahead of a big Q4 that historically has missed expectations."As the hysteria around transformation fades, and the focus shifts to actual numbers, what's left is a core, fundamental outlook for earnings and free cash flow that we think is at best stable, at worst deteriorating, and undoubtedly below consensus," J.P. Morgan analysts write.The firm is concerned that its $2.00 EPS target for GE in 2018 was based on organic growth that may have been too ambitious, and it lowers its 2018 EPS target to just $1.75."This profile, including high expectations which are now too high and worst-in-class [free cash flow] is neither safe nor deserved of a high multiple," the firm says, adding that it rates GE at Underweight with a Street-low $26 price target.

GE ramp-up in the second half of the year is critical, analysts say
General Electric (NYSE:GE) was yesterday's biggest laggard among Dow stocks, sinking 1.6% after reporting a 2% drop in orders for Q2, with industrial orders - GE’s jet engines, power turbines, oil production equipment, et. al. - plunging 16% amid weakness in oil and gas prices that hurt demand."The texture of this quarter is very similar to the two most recent quarters, with exceptionally weak orders,” says Morgan Stanley's Nigel Coe, who rates GE at Equal Weight with a $32 price target.GE's total Q2 revenues rose 15% Y/Y to $33.5B, but organic industrial sales excluding the Alstom acquisition fell 1%; GE needs to meet its own expectations for a substantial upturn in organic trends in H2 in an "extremely challenging" environment, Coe says."Those are capital intensive purchases and if those get pushed out even just a little bit" it could weaken GE's performance, says Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.Andrew Elofson at Davidson Investment Advisors takes the long view, seeing Q2 as "a speed bump on the path to their transformation” and not really looking at whether GE can hit its 5% organic sales growth target for H2.But Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas responded to the Q2 results by slapping a Sell rating on GE with a $26 price target, seeing no reason to own the shares that trade at more than 20x 2016 EPS estimates while "dozens" of mid-cap names with room to grow trade at or below 10x earnings - such as YRCW, TGI, AVH, GBX, ARII, CBI, UAL, SPR and ACM.

General Electric dips on slipping orders
GE reported earnings growth of $0.52 (+65% Y/Y) and revenue of $33.5B (+15% Y/Y) for Q2, but shares fell 1.8% in premarket action due to a 2% decrease in orders and "a volatile and slow-growth economy."The company said its power, aviation and health-care segments offset challenges in transportation and in oil and gas, but it expects to see strong organic growth in the second half of the year."We will continue to invest in key growth initiatives such as GE Digital, while returning [about] $26B to investors through buyback and dividends," CEO Jeff Immelt declared.GE Capital's exit plan has enabled it to return $15B in dividends year to date, and the company’s de-designation as a SIFI will give it more balance sheet flexibility.Q2 results Jul. 22, 2016, 7:48 AM | 12 Comments

GE hits eight-year high; some analysts see more upside
General Electric (GE +0.8%) rallies to its highest level in eight years after announcing that its Predix industrial operating system will be available on Microsoft's Azure cloud, but the company's sustained upward march has been a long time coming.Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management thinks GE's upward momentum will continue, thanks to underappreciated fundamentals as the company has "gotten rid of the bad stuff [and] has doubled down on the good stuff... aerospace, the Internet of things, health care [and] robotics and automation. Those are four of the most important secular bull markets over the next 5-10 years."Brown sees GE's balance sheet as flexible enough "to buy back more stock, raise their dividends and even do acquisitions... there aren't any flies on this story."Citigroup analysts see “another sloppy quarter” overall for industrial stocks but considers GE a top pick, with the potential for GE’s service business to grow by 9% Y/Y from 7%, a key driver because service represents close to 80% of GE's profits, which means the company’s growth visibility could be better than investors believe.

Report: Concern grows over failure of bolts used to secure subsea oil wells
GE (GE +1.1%), oil drillers and regulators are scrambling to determine why massive bolts used to connect subsea oil equipment keep failing, causing alarm over the safety of hundreds of wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Dow Jones reports.A U.S. investigation and two recent bolt failures have convinced regulators and industry officials that the problem goes beyond GE and its blowout preventers, according to the report; the Interior Department says flaws also have been found in bolts made by National Oilwell Varco (NOV +2.5%) and Schlumberger (SLB +1.3%), and in bolts used in other areas on subsea wells.GE says it is working with the Interior Department to address the problems and has supplied replacement parts to customers upon request.Companies already have begun the process of finding and replacing corroded bolts; Diamond Offshore (DO +1.9%), which has a fleet of 30 rigs, told investors in June that it had four unplanned “stack pulls” in Q2 with three of the repairs involving failed bolts, interruptions that likely will impact Q2 results.

Analysts doubt planned cost cuts from Siemens-Gamesa wind power deal
Siemens’ (OTCPK:SIEGY +2.7%) $11B wind power turbine merger with Gamesa (OTCPK:GCTAY -1.7%) creates a market giant to rival Vestas Wind Systems (OTCPK:VWDRY) and GE but faces a challenge in harnessing planned savings, according to analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley.Barclays expects only a fraction of the planned 70M revenue synergies will be achieved, and does not believe the onshore and offshore businesses offer "any sort of synergy potential" in sales, as the two businesses deal with different customers, technology and drivers.Siemens and Gamesa have identified €230M in cost cuts within four years, and while the product synergies “are clear,” achieving that target remains a risk, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Uglow says.Nevertheless, Stanley rates Siemens a Buy as "in terms of product overlap, Siemens brings a number one position in offshore turbines [and a] strong offering in developed markets.” Jun. 20, 2016, 11:48 AM | 3 Comments

GE, Alstom accused of decade-old bribes by ex-Petrobras exec
A high-ranking former Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) executive has told investigators that General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) paid bribes to win contracts more than a decade ago, in the latest expansion of Brazil’s huge Car Wash corruption scandal.Nestor Cervero, who once headed PBR’s international division, claims he received $700K in bribes from Alstom in exchange for choosing the company to supply four turbines for power plant projects, and that he had second-hand information that GE also bribed an official to win turbine contracts.Cervero, who was convicted last year of crimes including corruption and money laundering, says he obtained information from an associate that Alstom and GE each paid $10M in bribes to former senator and former PBR exec Delcidio Amaral in the late 1990s or early 2000s.GE says it is "not aware of any irregularity or wrongdoing in the contracts mentioned.’’ Jun. 7, 2016, 11:45 PM | 12 Comments

Alstom sues GE for breach of contract in train signal deal
General Electric (GE +1.1%) is being sued by Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) for breach of contract related to the company's sale of its train signaling business to the French company last November.GE and Alstom have been unable to resolve disputes over whether the $800M purchase price should be adjusted, up or down, to account for working capital and net debt, according to a complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan's U.S. district court.Alstom says GE breached the contract by refusing to let the jointly designated independent accounting firm Deloitte resolve the disputes, instead launching an arbitration proceeding with the International Chamber of Commerce.The train signaling transaction was completed on the same day GE bought Alstom's energy business for an adjusted price of €9.7B ($10.8B).

GE’s Immelt sees power turbines, renewable energy boosting growth in H2
GE CEO Jeff Immelt says he is optimistic about H2 of this year, citing stronger orders for power turbines, an improving market for renewable energy products and better demand in health care.Immelt, who is counting on GE’s industrial businesses spanning energy, aviation and health care equipment to see it through a “slow-growth and volatile” global economy, says the company is on track to boost operating EPS to at least $2.00 by 2018 from $1.31 in 2015 and $1.45-$1.55 this year.Among the positive signs Immelt discussed today at a Florida investor conference is improving demand in the U.S. and China for GE health care equipment such as MRI machines, X-ray machines and CT scanners; he also says GE expects to get the bulk of its anticipated $19B in revenue from its power business in H2.Immelt also says GE is ~80% of the way through its exit of GE Capital, ahead of schedule; nevertheless, GE shares closed -0.3% in today's trading.

GE Healthcare chief sheds dealmaking image
John Flannery built a reputation as a prolific rainmaker in his previous role as head of business development at General Electric (NYSE:GE), logging more than $26B in deals, yet acquisitions are far from his mind as CEO of the conglomerate's healthcare unit."When we look at the basic position of the company, we like the portfolio," Flannery said in an interview in Beijing. "So my mandate right now is to get the earnings growth going again, and there's a lot to just better managing the portfolio we have, align it more with customers and outcomes, for a better margin rate."GE Healthcare has committed to raising its profit margin by 50 bps this year with a goal of reaching 18% by 2018. Sales were down 4% and the profit margin fell by 40 bps to 16.3% last year. May 16, 2016, 8:35 AM | 1 Comment
Barron's Bennett defends GE against analyst pessimism
J.P. Morgan sees 10% downside ahead for General Electric (NYSE:GE), but Barron's Johanna Bennett believes GE looks like a buy, citing the company's healthy fundamentals and a 3% dividend yield.GE's Q1 earnings and guidance admittedly did little to boost confidence amid pain in the oil patch and a sluggish economy, yet as Bennett noted last month, profit is rising at a double-digit pace, and EPS is expected to increase 15% from $1.31 in 2015 to $1.51 this year and then rise 16.5% to $1.76 in 2017.GE’s oil and gas unit will not rebound quickly, but Citigroup analysts say the unit is well positioned for the long term and could stabilize this year if current market conditions hold steady.While GE may not raise its dividend until next year, the 3.1% yield easily beats the 1.75% paid by 10-year Treasurys.Now read GE: The impact of the downturn in the oil and gas industry, by the numbers May 13, 2016, 6:55 PM | 30 Comments
GE gets bearish view from J.P. Morgan, saying risks don't support premium
General Electric (GE -1.2%) is the Dow's biggest loser in the early going after JPMorgan Chase resumes coverage with an Underweight rating with a $27 price target, saying positives from the company's portfolio transformation and its technology potential are more than reflected in its current stock price.The firm says GE has achieved a "bold portfolio transformation” and has solid technology potential but the positives are factored in the shares, but the risk/reward is unfavorable in view of "a stubbornly high expectation forward earnings curve” combined with soft underlying earnings quality and free cash flow.GE's 2018 EPS target of $2.00 may be difficult to achieve, JPM says, since it would require two years of 10% profit growth following 1% growth in 2015-16 amid recent 5%-10% order declines."We don't argue that these are not 'good businesses,' what we argue with is ability to consistently outperform," JPM analyst Stephen Tusa writes. "We would change our thinking if free cash flow can show material improvement and reinstate the potential for gradual dividend increases."Now read General Electric: 50% dividend growth opportunity hiding in plain sight May 12, 2016, 10:38 AM | 33 Comments

Chance to buy the dip in GE about over
Down more than 2% not long ago, GE has rebounded to just a marginal loss in late-afternoon trade.Sellers seem to have focused on a 1% Y/Y decline in organic revenue, led by a 18% fall in revenue from the oil and gas equipment business - now GE's fourth-largest segment.The company, though, remains headed in the right direction, writes Johanna Bennett in Barron's. Profits are rising at a double-digit pace and there's plenty of cash to aggressively buy back stock and fund acquisitions. There's also the 2.9% dividend yield.

GE moves higher as Citigroup confident in power business
General Electric (GE +1.2%) is higher after Citigroup analysts make bullish comments about its power business, proclaiming "we do know a well-run facility when we see it" following a visit to the company's gas turbine facility in Greenville, S. Car., according to Barron's.Citi thinks that given more expensive parts and given the low cost to run it, GE's H Turbine should garner a much higher level of service activity than the F Class Turbine, and that GE continues to improve its ability to tie contract service agreements to its original equipment in power.The firm believes customers are likely more receptive to the idea as well because GE now offers a full power “solution” given its Alstom acquisition, which means customers no longer have to turn elsewhere for other service providers.

GE says Immelt earned $33M in 2015, announces board changes
General Electric (NYSE:GE) discloses the value of Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt’s total compensation fell ~11% last year to $33M, and that three board members will leave this year.Immelt’s total payout was less than a year earlier because the value of his pension rose at a slower rate in 2015. but excluding the change in pension value, his adjusted compensation rose 14% to $23.4M; $3.8M in base salary and $5.4M bonus were little changed from the previous year."Immelt performed extremely well in 2015 with one of the best performance years in the company’s history,” as GE boosted its market value by $40B during the year and expanded industrial profit margins, earnings and revenue, GE says in the filing.Two of GE's longest-serving directors, Douglas Warner III and James Cash, will not seek re-election to the board after serving a respective 24 and 19 years, and Robert Swieringa will retire from the board after 14 years.To replace the departures, GE is nominating Sebastien Bazin, CEO of hotel chain Accor; Peter Henry, a professor of economics and finance at NYU's Stern School of Business, and Lowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon Communications.

GE Oil & Gas head weighing Iran growth opportunity
GE (GE -0.1%) oil chief Lorenzo Simonelli says he visited Iran in recent weeks to "understand what was taking place in the country" as the company plots a strategy for its oil and gas business in Iran as U.S. sanctions ease."Iran is a big market from an oil and gas perspective,” Simonelli tells Bloomberg, adding that GE will proceed only if government rules allow the company to do business there, "but it’s a market where we used to transact."GE is pursuing growth amid the slowdown in global oil and gas activity - revenue in GE Oil & Gas fell 14% in 2015 to $16.5B and may drop another 10%-15% in 2016 - but Simonelli says the weakened industry may provide opportunities for the division.

Buy Honeywell over GE, Deutsche Bank says
Honeywell (HON +0.1%) is a better buy for investors than General Electric (GE -0.5%), Deutsche Bank analysts say, as its fundamentals have continued to line up more favorably over the past few weeks with "an abundance of favorable HON attributes that should allow HON to outperform GE."Deutsche Bank raises its target price on Buy-rated HON to $120 from $105, and considers HON's reaffirmed guidance too conservative, saying an extra two points of realized top line growth at 30% incremental profit contribution could drive ~$0.25 higher EPS than its current $7.05 forecast, or more if the company also pursued faster share repurchase.In contrast, the firm sees little upside from the GE consensus forecast over the next two years, particularly considering the rollover GE has experienced for its equipment orders over the past two quarters.

"We have delivered for you in the last five years...but we are still underowned by big investors.""In this time of uncertainty, why not GE? We have great businesses, global scale and strong initiatives. We have a ton of cash that can protect you. And we will lead the Industrial Internet. We are the Digital Industrial.""Some say we are in an 'industrial recession,' but I don't really know what that means. I learn more from what I see in individual markets and hear from customers...Growth is available, but you have to work at it.""I have put together a team of early career GE leaders to coach me on our simplification journey. They inspire and motivate me; but listening to them is humbling. Through their eyes, I can see the evil nature of corporate bureaucracy; they are a good mirror for my own failings."Read the letter here Feb. 29, 2016, 9:55 AM | 14 Comments

GE to install LED lighting at 5,000 J.P. Morgan bank branches
General Electric (NYSE:GE) says it has struck a deal to install new lights at 5,000 JPMorgan Chase U.S. bank branches.Under the deal, Current, the new GE business that sells LED lighting systems, will replace ~1.4M existing lights with LEDs, covering 25M sq. ft., over the next two years, and estimates that, once installed, the new lights could reduce JPM's lighting-related energy use in its branches by 50%.The deal also is considered a shot in the arm for Current, which represents a new front in GE's effort to revive its industrial offerings and shake up the company's public image.Current CEO Maryrose Sylvester says the company is aiming to use the promise of energy cost savings from LED fixtures to convince customers to adopt other technologies GE can build into lighting systems, such as sensors that can adjust light based on the traffic within a room, or temperature.

Diamond Offshore CEO: Oil industry in a "severe and prolonged down cycle"
The oil industry nightmare will not end anytime soon, and "it seems clear that the oversupply of drilling capacity may persist well into 2017 and possibly beyond," Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO) CEO Marc Edwards said in today's earnings conference call."Deepwater drilling will recover... What I can't tell you is when," the CEO said; in the meantime, DO is not only eliminating its dividend, but also considering mergers and/or acquisitions, buying distressed assets, and other crisis measures.Analysts like DO's new service agreement with GE, which is expected to help lower idle time for rigs on hire - crucial for drillers struggling to lease out offshore rigs and cut costs as oil and gas producers scale back spending.DO loses up to $500K of revenue each day a rig is down, while the oil and gas producing customer also loses as much money, Edwards says, calling downtime the industry's "Achilles' heel."Evercore ISI analyst James West says the service model will create a much more visible stream of cash flow for equipment providers compared with the cash flow from selling equipment, "which is very cyclical and very lumpy."Among companies that could adopt a similar model are offshore rig providers such as Noble Corp. (NYSE:NE), which could tie up with oilfield equipment manufacturers such as National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Cameron (NYSE:CAM), analysts say. Feb. 8, 2016, 6:58 PM | 17 Comments
Diamond Offshore scraps dividend; posts Q4 earnings beat on lower costs
Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO) says it is discontinuing its dividend after reporting Q4 earnings of $0.89/share, excluding a $499M non-cash charge related to the impairment of nine drilling units.DO has paid a regular dividend of $0.125/share every quarter since mid-2005; suspending it will save ~$69M annually.DO says Q4 drilling revenue totaled $544M, 19% lower than the $674M in the prior-year quarter, while related expenses fell 29% Y/Y to $256M from $359 a year ago.Q4 dayrates on its ultra-deepwater floating rigs rose to $531K from $493K in the year-ago quarter, and the utilization rate rose to 70% from 66% a year ago.DO also says it is transferring the maintenance and service of well control equipment to General Electric's (NYSE:GE) oil and gas unit, in an attempt to simplify operations and reduce downtime.Under the 10-year service agreement, GE will buy the blowout preventer systems on four of DO's rigs located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for $210M.

Oil prices weigh on GE, but bad oil news can become good news in the future
GE shares fell 1.2% in today's trade even after reporting better than expected Q4 earnings and as the broader market rallied sharply, as results from the oil and gas business - now the company's fourth largest segment by revenue - spooked investors.Revenue in GE's oil and gas unit slid 16% for Q4 and 14% for FY 2015 to $16.45B, but Heard On The Street's Charles Grant says "today’s pain means the likelihood of generating future high investment returns goes up," adding that GE’s diverse revenue allows it to take advantage of the sluggish environment better than stand-alone oil peers.Meanwhile, GE said in today's earnings conference call that plans to spend $3.4B on restructuring measures this year, double the $1.7B it targeted just last monthi, "with an emphasis on oil and gas" operations.GE says its application to drop its “too big to fail” label is unlikely to come before March; CFO Jeff Bornstein says GE is poised to close the sale of $30B in commercial lending assets and unload a Utah bank charter, and then plans to ask the Fed to remove it from the ranks of systemically important financial institutions.

GE remains upbeat on China
China’s slowdown has rattled global markets, but General Electric (GE +3.2%) vice chairman John Rice remains upbeat, telling the World Economic Forum in Davos that "there’s not anything happening in China today that causes us to alter our long-term strategy there."Rice says GE has enjoyed strong demand in China and other countries where growth rates have slowed, benefiting from larger-scale infrastructure projects, particularly in energy, that continue to move ahead."In a world where we haven’t been sure what was going to happen with [the U.S. Ex-Im Bank], there is capital in China ready to go where we see business," Rice says, noting China's cooperation on a $1B power deal in Pakistan last year.The focus on the volatility in China’s stock market and the slumping currency misses the underlying strength of an economy that is still growing at a rate that is the envy of much of the world, according to Rachel Duan, GE’s China chief.GE, which now has a workforce of 25K in China, reports Q4 earnings before the market opens tomorrow.

It makes for a good excuse, but the company had also outgrown its campus in staid Fairfield, and Boston will no doubt be an easier spot from which to lure talent.

GE Healthcare backs Toronto-based cell therapy development center
GE Healthcare (GE +0.2%), the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev) and the Center for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine (CCRM) are teaming up to build an advanced therapeutic cell technologies center in Toronto backed by a CAD$40M investment from GE and FedDev Ontario.The aim of the project is to accelerate the development and adoption of cell manufacturing technologies that improve patient access to new regenerative medicine-base therapies.GE and CCRM encourage pharmaceutical, biotech and cell therapy companies to get involved, considering forecasts that the global market for cell-based therapies could be as large as US$20B in ten years.GE Healthcare chief Kieran Murphy says, "It is increasingly clear that cell therapies and regenerative medicine will transform healthcare globally, but successful industrialization is now crucial to widespread adoption. This new center will enable us to work with cell therapy companies to push beyond existing technical limits and problem-solve. Toronto's concentrated and collaborative clinical infrastructure, combined with the strong guidance of the internationally-renowned CCRM, make it an ideal location for the center."

Bloomberg: GE receives bids from two Chinese suitors for appliances unit
General Electric (NYSE:GE) has received bids of more than $3B each from China’s Midea Group and Qingdao Haier for its home appliance business after a sale to Electrolux fell apart last month, Bloomberg reports.A sale to an Asian buyer is seen as more likely to get regulatory approval, because Asian competitors in the industry generally have a lower market share.CEO Jeffrey Immelt said at a December investor meeting that there has been "significant inbound interest" in the business and that he expects to reach a deal early this year.Midea is China's biggest manufacturer of consumer appliances, with a 17.1% market share in 2015, followed by Qingdao Haier with 7.9%.

A look at 2015's busted deals
Despite a record-setting year for M&A, 2015 has also been full of plenty of no's from U.S. antitrust officials:Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) agreed to buy its rival Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) in February for more than $6B, but regulators worried the tie-up would eliminate competition and sought to block the merger in December.Although General Electric (NYSE:GE) decided to sell its appliances business to Electrolux (OTCPK:ELUXY) for $3.3B in 2014, the Justice Department filed suit this summer, alleging the deal would result in higher kitchen appliance prices. GE walked away from the deal last month.Sysco (NYSE:SYY) reached its $3.5B deal for U.S. Foods in December 2013, hoping the combination would help it cut costs, however, the tie-up got shot down by the FTC in June.The nation's two biggest cable operators, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE:TWC), reached a $45.2B deal to combine in February 2014, although the DOJ said the merger would make Comcast "an unavoidable gatekeeper for Internet-based services." The latter canceled the deal in April.Thai Union (OTC:TUFRF), owner of the Chicken of the Sea brand, struck a $1.5B deal for U.S. rival Bumble Bee Seafoods in December 2014, but the companies walked away from the agreement a year later amid antitrust objections.

GE well positioned in large turbine market, analyst says
General Electric (GE -1.1%) is well positioned to compete in the large turbine market, Bernstein's Steven Winoker says, as he remains positive on the power generation space and on GE’s transformation with its recent acquisition of Alstom.GE already is a well-established leader in the segment for smaller turbines and its strong position in the largest units showcases the company’s breadth, says Winoker, adding that his meetings with management provides a clearer picture of GE’s current process and prospects.Grid stability will be an increasing issue, Winoker says, and in the more immediate near-term, retirement of coal plants should provide a "meaningful lift" for the gas turbine business.

The collapse of General Electric's (GE -1.1%) sale of its appliance business to Electrolux is disappointing but not a particularly big setback for GE, says Bernstein’s Steven Winoker.GE will collect a $175M fee from Electrolux, which will help offset the damage done by not selling the unit, which should come out to just $0.02/share during Q4, Winoker says; appliances will add to earnings in 2016, at least until sold to a different buyer, which Winoker expects to happen sometime next year.Winoker thinks GE may look outside the U.S. or to P-E firms to find a new buyer for the business.

Analyst lists eight reasons GE's takeover of Alstom is extraordinary
Bernstein analyst Steve Winoker offers eight reasons for optimism following yesterday's conference call from General Electric (NYSE:GE) updating its takeover of Alstom's energy assets.At the top of the list, GE built a more robust business case for value addition over time that creates a $50B turbine services backlog and puts it on track to save $3B through cost cuts by 2020, Winoker says.With enhanced offerings for boilers, steam turbines, gas and steam turbine generators and grid solutions, Alstom increases GE’s scope in a combined cycle power plant to 60% from 20% to 60%, and brings the ability to serve the installed base of other OEM’s, a key potential growth driver.Among other reasons cited by Winoker, management describes the Alstom integration as one of the best transitions it has seen.

"We've got all the tools to do it with, and I think from a capital allocation, earnings growth, organic growth standpoint, we are a good bet for investors right now."The multibusiness structure helps, he added: "While the only-gas business may be tougher, the aviation business is booming, and you add all of those up and you get an industrial organic growth in the mid-single digits. That looks damn good in the environment we are in right now. So, that's what it takes."Elsewhere: GE will pay just $2.25M as a penalty for releasing potentially unsafe air pollution from a hazardous waste incinerator in New York state, and for filing false pollution control reports.

General Electric (GE -0.4%) is removed from Credit Suisse's U.S. Focus List but retains the firm's Outperform rating and a higher price target - to $34 from $31 - as the company is poised for robust earnings growth driven by the closure of the Alstom deal and various changes to its portfolio.Credit Suisse says many of GE's positive catalysts it had highlighted have played out or are playing out or becoming reflected in the share price, and it continues to view the stock as more attractive than most other large conglomerates.The firm adds that the sale of GE’s capital intensive and low growth Capital business and the redeployment of incremental capital to its high margin industrial business bodes well for the company.

Focus on industrial stocks with strong end markets, Bernstein analyst says
Market growth remains challenging whether there is an industrial recession or not, so investors should focus on stocks with strong end markets, particularly Allegion (ALLE +0.3%) and Danaher (DHR +0.5%), Bernstein's Steven Winoker says.Other stocks in a lower but still generally favorable tier include General Electric (GE +0.8%), Honeywell (HON +0.9%), Ingersoll-Rand (IR +0.9%) and 3M (MMM +0.7%), as these companies are exposed to favorable end markets but also to meaningfully weak markets, the analyst says.Aside from their portfolio transformations, DHR and GE have benefited and should continue to benefit from their above-average growth profiles in the current low-growth environment, Winoker says.Energy-heavy Dover (DOV +0.2%), Pentair (PNR +0.4%) and Emerson Electric (EMR +0.2%) remain the most challenged, according to Winoker, while Eaton (ETN +1.1%), Rockwell Automation (ROK +0.5%) and Tyco (TYC -0.2%) have a mix of tailwinds and headwinds, with the former more challenged on hydraulics/trucks and the latter two on energy.Winoker sees limited downside for DOV, which is highly linked to crude oil prices but is performing well in the ~80% of its portfolio not linked to oil.Earlier: Low expectations are no longer enough for multi-industry stocks, analyst says (Nov. 19) Nov. 20, 2015, 11:30 AM | 3 Comments

Judge pushing settlement in U.S. dispute over GE-Electrolux deal
In the trial adjudicating an antitrust fight between the Dept. of Justice and Electrolux (OTCPK:ELUXY +2.5%) and General Electric (GE -0.8%), Electrolux's chief argued again his company should be able to pursue a $3.3B deal for GE's appliance business.The government has alleged that in a relatively consolidate market, U.S. consumers would pay 5% more for kitchen appliances if Electrolux got to stop competing with GE appliances. It's pursuing an injunction to stop the deal, but judge Emmet Sullivan is again pressing the two sides to settle.Electrolux -- which makes Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan brands -- has said the DOJ isn't taking into account foreign competition, but today CEO Keith McLoughlin acknowledged the company's internal documents describe the U.S. appliance market as relatively consolidated compared to Europe. He's suggesting price increases in the U.S. have been prompted by hikes in input materials, including steel, nickel and petrochemicals.The Justice Dept. is focusing on the lower-end kitchen appliances often put by homebuilders into new houses and apartments or sold at big box stores; 90% of the stoves and ovens sold to big builders and property managers are made by Electrolux, GE and Whirlpool, it says.Previously: Trial begins as U.S. opposes $3.3B Electrolux-GE appliance deal (Nov. 09 2015) Nov. 19, 2015, 6:19 PM | 3 Comments

GE closes above $30 for the first time in seven years
General Electric (NYSE:GE) hit a milestone today it hadn’t achieved in seven years: Its stock closed above $30.In the years since June 10, 2008, GE’s stock has struggled despite CEO Jeff Immelt’s efforts to reassure investors that the company was changing, WSJ's Ted Mann writes; shares have been in recovery mode this year, gaining 19% YTD vs. the S&P’s 1% increase."A lot of people viewed GE as kind of getting out of the black box” when it decided to sell off most of GE Capital, says William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann, who has turned increasingly bullish on Immelt’s vision for the future of GE’s heavy industrial businesses.Heymann believes the stock can rise to $37/share by late next year, which would leave GE close to the $39.66 price of the shares on Sept. 7, 2001, the day Immelt became CEO.

Nelson Peltz's purchase of a $2.5B stake in General Electric GE prompts Standard & Poor's to reduce its outlook on GE's credit rating to Negative from Stable, which puts the company’s AA+ rating on watch for a potential downgrade.Peltz's Trian fund is suggesting that GE should shed even more of GE Capital, be cautious on acquisitions and add up to $20B in debt to support stock repurchases, which comes after GE management already had made statements implying it could adopt a less conservative financial policy, the ratings firm says.The Negative outlook "reflects our expectation that the company could potentially adopt a less conservative financial policy,” S&P says, adding that it could cut the credit rating if GE “significantly increases” its debt load or shrinks its industrial focus along with its finance unit.

GE to move engine plant to Canada, blames lack of Ex-Im Bank financing
General Electric (GE -1.2%) says it will stop manufacturing large, gas-powered engines at its Waukesha, Wis., plant and move 350 jobs to a new facility in Canada, citing the inability to access financing from the U.S. Export-Import bank.GE says it will invest $265M in a new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant at a Canadian location yet to be determined, in order to access export financing support for products made in the new plant from Export Development Canada.GE says export financing deals, like those it has secured in the past from the Export-Import Bank, are required as part of a formal bid on many major projects it competes for; the U.S. Congress failed in July to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, the export financing entity in the U.S. Sep. 28, 2015, 10:25 AM | 114 Comments

With Weatherford out, GE may be primed for Halliburton assets
Weatherford's (WFT +9.7%) cancellation of its plans to raise $1B in a stock and debt offering is good news for the company, Jefferies analyst Brad Handler says as he reaffirms his Buy rating on the stock.The analyst says "the 'on paper' benefit of adding drill bits and upgrading Weatherford's directional drilling capabilities/platform, and that Weatherford's global footprint points to meaningful synergies... yet more important for us was the risk of further dilution for equity holders."The money could have been used to buy assets from Halliburton (HAL +0.2%) as it tries to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI -0.6%); WFT's apparent withdrawal means that GE (GE -0.2%) could be the only player left that can afford the assets.But the conflicting announcements from WFT are a "blow to management credibility," analysts at Tudor Pickering say.

GE to expand aviation ops in Europe, citing lack of U.S. export financing
GE (GE -0.8%) says it plans to create a development center for turboprop engines in Europe, again citing the failure of the U.S. Congress to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank.GE says it will invest more than $400M in the European turboprop engine development, testing and production operation, creating 500-1,000 jobs, and plans an additional $78M in similar investments for Canada and Brazil.GE Aviation says it would be at a competitive disadvantage with turboprop rival Pratt & Whitney Canada, a division of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), because Pratt can provide government-backed credit assistance to its customers.The news comes after GE said on Tuesday it plans to shift up to 500 U.S. power turbine manufacturing jobs to Europe and China because it can no longer access Export-Import Bank financing.

GE exec: No intent to sell any of healthcare business
Amid a flurry of divestments, General Electric (GE +2.5%) says it's got no intent to split off any (significant) parts of its healthcare business, despite questions about whether it fits the business any more than finance assets."Bottom line is we have been black and white that all aspects of healthcare are part of our portfolio," GE Healthcare CEO John Flannery told a Morgan Stanley investor conference.That's despite speculation that some parts could be more valuable if separated. The company gets "a lot of questions" about the life sciences part of the business, but it's "a high-value beachfront property that is appreciating in value," Flannery says.The business will focus on internal improvement rather than a sale or split, he said.Previously: General Electric completes sale of more GE Capital assets (Sep. 16 2015)Previously: GE shuffles execs, creates GE Digital unit to organize efforts (Sep. 14 2015)Previously: GE selling transport finance unit to BMO Financial (Sep. 10 2015) Sep. 16, 2015, 7:10 PM | 10 Comments

Boeing jet suffered rare engine failure, U.S. air safety regulator says
Initial findings from the National Transportation Safety Board determine that the fire that heavily damaged a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 British Airways' jet in Las Vegas earlier this week was not contained within the core of the plane's left General Electric (NYSE:GE) engine, a rare event that will intensify scrutiny of the incident.The uncontained failure is the first on a GE90 engine since its introduction to service in 1995, and aerospace engineers have designed their potential causes out of modern jet engines as spewing debris can cause catastrophic damage to a plane's fuselage and wing.The GE90 model aboard the plane was an older variant of the turbofan engine; Boeing has an exclusivity agreement with GE, which supplies a larger more-powerful GE90 engine for the 777s built today.GE says it has sent technical personnel to Las Vegas to assist in the investigation and that it is premature to discuss the NTSB's findings.

Regulators: GE Capital, AIG to keep systemically important designation
U.S. regulators have announced that for now, GE Capital (NYSE:GE) will keep a designation as "systemically important" -- and thus be subject to closer oversight.The Financial Stability Oversight Council made the decision today and said GE didn't contest the board's decision.The panel also said it planned to keep the designation for AIG as well.

GE may ship $10B in work overseas as Export-Import Bank languishes
GE is taking steps to shift some U.S. manufacturing work overseas since the U.S. Export-Import Bank will be shut down at least until September, Vice Chairman John Rice tells Reuters.Rice, who runs GE's global operations, says the company is bidding on more than $10B worth of projects that require support from an export credit agency.But Ex-Im has been unable to consider any new financing requests since Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire on June 30, so GE says it is arranging with ECAs in other countries to finance the deals involved, with much of the production going to GE plants in those foreign locations.Rice says GE is not moving to shift work and jobs overseas "just to make a point" to Congress, but to win contracts that require export credit agency support, saying "We're doing this because if we don't, we can't submit a valid tender."Earlier: Boeing considers moving work overseas due to Export-Import uncertainty Jul. 30, 2015, 6:58 PM | 84 Comments
Feds tell non-bank SIFIs to upgrade living wills
So-called living wills required by those financials deemed systemically important are supposed to provide a detailed plan for how a company might safely wind itself down amid the next financial crisis.In what probably shouldn't be a surprise given how regulators sent the banks back to the drawing board last year, the Federal Reserve and FDIC have found deficiencies in the plans of GE Capital (NYSE:GE), AIG, and Prudential (NYSE:PRU). The three had filed initial plans one year ago. Versions two are due by year-end.MetLife (NYSE:MET) has also been deemed a SIFI, but was given an extension and doesn't have to file its living will until next year.

Bull boosts target on Synchrony Financial
"We believe our valuation is justified insofar as Synchrony (NYSE:SYF), the largest provider of private label credit cards in the U.S. based on purchase volume and receivables, is well positioned to increase its share of the growing U.S. credit card market, thus enabling it to sustain a credit card loan receivables growth rate in the high single digits while generating higher returns than its general purpose credit card issuer peers," says BTIG's Mark Palmer, boosting his price target to $42 from $36.There's also the company's strong capital position, giving it a good case to make to regulators for approval for a capital return program following the separation from GE.Palmer's $42 price target is based on 14x his FY17 EPS estimate of $3.02.Previously: Synchrony Financial on the move following Q2 results (July 17) Jul. 21, 2015, 9:21 AM | 10 Comments
GE Capital gets more time before facing Fed stress tests
In an acknowledgement of General Electric's (GE -0.4%) plans to dramatically shrink its bank-like businesses, the Fed will delay until 2018 the time when GE Capital would have to face the central bank's annual stress test.The operation would still need to comply with basic capital and liquidity rules by the start of the year, though GE Capital says it's already met these.GE Capital's assets stood at about $500B not long ago, and it has assured the Fed of its plans to sell the bulk of them, and indeed has already sold or put under agreement a sizable amount.Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo: "It would not be sensible for us to disregard GE’s announced plan to reduce [GE Capital’s] size by about 70%, particularly in light of the fact that it is demonstrably executing that plan."

Synchrony Financial on the move following Q2 results
"The growth story appears very much intact," says BTIG's Mark Palmer, reiterating his Buy rating and $36 price target on Synchrony Financial (SYF +3.6%) following its earnings beat this morning.One key concern of the bulls is what happens when GE later this year distributes its 84.6% stake in Synchrony to those GE shareholders electing to take the stock. The success of the exchange, says Palmer, depends on whether GE owners buy into the growth prospects of SYF's private-label credit card business. These results, combined with a trio of new partnership deals during the quarter, should go a long way toward that.Previously: Deposits grow, asset quality improves at Synchrony Financial (July 17)Previously: Synchrony Financial beats by $0.03, beats on revenue (July 17) Jul. 17, 2015, 12:11 PM | 18 Comments

As GE’s divestiture plans hit hurdles, alternatives begin to be considered
U.S. and European regulatory resistance could force GE to seek other deals and perhaps more share buybacks, as two of the company's moves to focus on higher-margin products are now in doubt over concerns they will hurt competition.GE executives today met with European authorities in Brussels to ease concerns that its planned acquisition of Alstom's power equipment business would leave Europe with two gas turbine players."Alstom is in that core of what they're trying to become," says Oakbrook's Peter Jankovskis. "If you can't lock up Alstom, your path for generating earnings is going to have to change."If Alstom falls through - and GE has said the deal could add $0.15-$0.20 to EPS in 2018 - analysts say GE likely would pursue other acquisitions to boost its core industrial businesses, buy back more shares, or a combination of both.Yesterday, the U.S. government sued to block GE's appliances sale to Electrolux, saying it would stifle competition for items such as stove tops, ranges and ovens.Should the appliances sale to Electrolux collapse, GE could seek buyers such as LG Electronics, Samsung Electronics, Chinese manufacturers or Mexico's Mabe, in which GE holds a stake, or P-E companies.

GE Hitachi poised to appoint new CEO
GE Hitachi (NYSE:GE) executive Jay Wileman is in line to succeed Caroline Reda as President and CEO of the company if GE is able to close on its deal to purchase French turbine maker Alstom.Wileman is the general manager of nuclear power plants, but Reba says she accepted a position leading the $5B North American business in the new power services business.GE's $13.8B offer for Alstom is being reviewed by European Union regulators, who have set an Aug. 21 deadline for their decision.

NYT: GE struggling to unload Australian units
Bids for five GE Capital (GE -0.8%) Australian commercial lending and leasing businesses - fleet financing, private plane financing, equipment rental, working capital lending, leveraged loans - were due on Monday, and a number of usual suspects have expressed interest. Few, however, are seeing a whole lot of value thanks to a lack of scale and margins.GE's consumer lending business in Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was the subject of fierce competition among potential buyers, ultimately gong for $6.3B to a consortium of Varde Partners, KKR, and Deutsche Bank.In an effort to keep interest going for the commercial businesses, Morgan Stanley - hired by GE to take care of the sale - isn't keeping a strict timetable of when preliminary bids must be submitted.Source: NYT Jun. 15, 2015, 2:41 PM
Europe regulators send concerns to GE over Alstom energy deal
General Electric (GE -0.6%) receives the European Commission's statement of objections relating to its proposed $17B acquisition of Alstom's (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) power business, a step that does not necessarily prejudge the final outcome of the deal review but highlights the tough negotiations that still lie ahead for GE to win consent for the deal more than a year after it was announced.In response to today's filing, GE says it is working "constructively" with the commission to explore remedies that could both address the EU's concerns and preserve the deal's economics, and that it still aims to close the transaction in H2 of this year.The timing of the statement of objections gives GE and Alstom about two months to reach a compromise with the EU ahead of its Aug. 21 deadline to rule on the deal.Earlier: Alstom will continue to defend GE deal Jun. 12, 2015, 2:47 PM | 25 Comments
Alstom will continue to defend GE deal
Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY) says it will continue to provide evidence on the positive impact of its power unit sale to General Electric (NYSE:GE), following reports that stated EU antitrust regulators could issue a statement of objections today over the proposed bid.Such a document would set out the EU's view of why the deal is anti-competitive, and would be a prelude to a veto unless the companies come up with strong arguments or concessions.Previously: EU to warn GE on Alstom power deal (Jun. 11 2015) Jun. 12, 2015, 4:09 AM | 9 Comments
Bloomberg: Several mulling bids for GE's U.S. commercial lending business

GE’s finance exit means billions more for M&A
GE's $12B deal to sell its U.S. private-equity lending business to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is just the beginning of its plan to shed ~$200B of GE Capital assets - and a whole lot of cash to spend on takeovers.Although GE may not make a move right away as it tries to complete the $14B purchase of most of Alstom’s energy business, Bloomberg figures it could amass a $40B war chest for takeovers.Among speculated targets: Pentair (NYSE:PNR), a provider of water pumps and filtration systems; Flowserve (NYSE:FLS), a maker of industrial pumps and valves; electrical components manufacturer Hubbell (HUB.A, HUB.B); life sciences equipment maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (NYSE:BIO); and some of the assets Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) will divest as part of their merger.Whatever the target, acquisitions likely will be part of GE’s transformation after asset sales and returning capital to shareholders.

How big is GE Capital?
In a letter to the Federal Reserve in May, General Electric (NYSE:GE) said its finance arm had $501B in total assets at the end of 2014, enough to rank it as the country’s seventh largest bank.Just weeks earlier, however, GE had used a different number - $363B - in a presentation to investors and analysts.The $138B separating the two figures is the difference between what official accounting rules require (sent to the Fed) and what GE calls "ending net investment" (an in-house metric the company rolled out seven years ago when it was under pressure during the financial crisis), WSJ reports."We disclose ENI in addition to total assets so that our investors can better assess our total capital invested in financial services," GE spokesman Seth Martin said.To accounting experts, however, it could just be another in a long line of "pro forma" figures that companies have trotted out over the years to show their business in a better light.

What keeps General Electric (GE +0.2%) CEO Jeff Immelt up at night? "Government aside, staying relevant," Immelt said during an interview with Fortune's Pattie Sellers.What is the new GE? It is a connected, digitized, high-tech, industrial infrastructure company.When you stepped up to the plate in 2001, GE stock was trading at $40/share, today it's trading at $27. Do you feel bad about that? I've always believed in accountability, but the company needed to change (and that takes time to do). When I first became CEO there was a difference between image and reality, but today they are alike.How difficult was it for you to succeed Jack Welch? And when did you feel that you came out of his shadow? I never thought of myself like that. It's a new place and a new day. We're changing the face of the company going forward.After GE is done with its restructuring, what will its finance division look like? We will be a $135B-$140B company with $10B in finance. Our finance division will only stick to energy, aviation and markets we know.

GE would sell intellectual property rights to secure Alstom deal, Immelt says
GE is willing to sell intellectual property rights to allay European Commission concerns that its $17B acquisition of Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) could distort competition in the gas turbine market, CEO Jeff Immelt said today.The comments are the most concrete indication to date of what remedy GE is willing to offer to break an impasse over approval for the deal.Immelt said GE would not do anything that impacts the service revenue stream.The EC has argued that a combined GE-Alstom would control about half of the market for 50Hz frequency turbines in Europe and the rest of the world excluding China; as a rule of thumb, the EC is wary of post-merger concentrations greater than 40%.GE rejects concerns that the tie-up would distort competition, saying that European demand is too small for distortions of competition to be a serious concern, as only about four gas turbines are sold in Europe each year out of global sales of 200.Earlier: Immelt presents: GE Capital sales ahead of plan May 20, 2015, 7:07 PM | 11 Comments

GE says it would lose Angola locomotive deal if Ex-Im Bank closes
GE would lose a $350M deal to build locomotives for Angola, and perhaps billions of dollars more in future export opportunities, if Congress closes the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the head of GE's transportation unit tells Reuters.GE's Russell Stokes claims up to 1,800 jobs at GE, its suppliers and local businesses in 12 states would be put at risk because, without Ex-Im financing, Angola would buy Chinese-built locomotives.The bank's opponents say its loans amount to corporate welfare and that GE can seek private financing, but the exec says private financing could never compare to the lower rates offered by government-backed export credit agencies."We'd still go out and try to compete, [but] on some of these big international tenders like this one, you're going to lose," Stokes says.

Barron's: Honeywell a better bet than GE
With the shedding of its finance arm last month, GE has indicated that it can deliver 10% earnings growth annually from its industrial side in the next four years, but Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has been delivering on 10%-plus profit growth ever since it remade itself more than a decade ago.Honeywell shares could rise by about 20% in the next year and close to 50% in the longer-term if it continues to meet its forecasts and improve its margins, writes Barron's Sandra Ward.HON shares are trading at around 15x the company's 2016 earnings estimates, well below the average of 17x assigned to multi-industrial companies.In contrast to GE, which saw its shares lose 33% of their value in the past 13 years as its strategy meandered and its massive financial operations foundered, Honeywell has risen 200%. Sales have nearly doubled to $40B, and its market value has mushroomed to $80B from $20B. May 11, 2015, 8:07 AM | 14 Comments

At least a half-dozen major industrial companies - including GE, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Dover (NYSE:DOV), Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) - are said to be weighing offers for oilfield services assets worth $5B-$10B that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is preparing to sell ahead of its pending merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), Bloomberg reports.HAL reportedly will send offering materials to those companies, as well as P-E firms and rival oilfield services providers, in the coming weeks; first up likely will be the drill bits unit and another that uses data to track and steer the direction of drills.These companies could own an edge over oilfield services companies that analysts have pegged as logical bidders for HAL’s castoffs - such as National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Superior Energy Services (NYSE:SPN) - because HAL might not want to give any more market share to companies that already offer the same services, preferring to sell to new players entering the market.

Einhorn: GE's chicanery on earnings
"That GE chose to exit and finally own up to its cumulative chicanery rather than face its first Fed-supervised stress test is one of the real successes of Dodd-Frank," writes David Einhorn, noting the "staggering" $16B after-tax charge the company will take this quarter in connection with the plan to sell GE Capital's assets."Given that GE is exiting these portfolios after several years of economic and valuation recoveries and still has to take an enormous loss, the gigacharge adds clarity to the multi-decade debate about the integrity of GE's reported results."The charge will also drain another 5-7% from S&P 500 quarterly earnings.

GE and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) say they will take steps to cushion the impact of a stronger dollar, after GE said foreign currency effects whacked $950M, or four percentage points, off its Q1 sales, while HON also reported a four-point Q1 drag from a stronger dollar and projected that exchange fluctuations would weigh down sales by $1.7B this year.GE says it is considering different locations where it can manufacture products or components for businesses, such as its power and healthcare units, and HON has been hedging transactions that its individual foreign subsidiaries make when they import in dollars, and now it is also hedging when the company's foreign sales are translated back into the dollar.The impact of currency shifts on U.S. companies will be highlighted further next week with quarterly reports from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which already cut its 2015 financial forecast in January over currency worries, as well as from 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW).

GE posts loss amid plans of finance sale
Excluding costs related to the sale of GE Capital, adjusted profit from continuing operations fell 5% Y/Y to $3.1B, or $0.31 per share, but beat estimates by a penny.Results were weighed down by about $16B in charges tied to its disposal of most of GE Capital, including an agreement to sell $26.5B in real estate assets and buy back about $50B of shares.GE Capital revenues during the quarter fell 39% to $5.98B.Industrial segment revenues edged down 1% to $24.36B, as growth in power, water and transportation businesses was offset by declines in oil, gas and health care divisions.Revenue from its oil & gas unit fell 8% to $3.96B, the most among GE's (NYSE:GE) industrial businesses.GE -0.3% premarketQ1 results Apr. 17, 2015, 7:17 AM | 10 Comments

Bombardier reportedly working with UBS, Citigroup on rail sale
Bombardier (OTCQX:BDRBF, OTCPK:BDRAF) has hired UBS and Citigroup to advise on a potential IPO or sale of its rail unit, which could be valued at ~$5B in a sale, Bloomberg reports.Splitting off the rail unit would allow management to focus on turning around the aerospace unit, which posted a 2014 loss of $995M; the rail unit - whose products include locomotives, subway cars and signaling and control equipment - is the healthier part of the company, with 2014 earnings of $429M.GE and Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY, OTCPK:AOMFF) are speculated to have interest in the rail unit.

Barron's on GE: Sell the news
After Friday's 10.8% moonshot, General Electric (NYSE:GE) sells for 16x 2015 estimated earnings, writes Avi Salzman, a pretty rich multiple considering the company's industrial businesses have boosted operating earnings by an average 1.4% annually for the last four years.United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) trades at a 16 multiple, but has grown operating earnings by an average 4.9% over that period, and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) sells for 17x after growing earnings by an average 16%."Here’s the problem: The assets they have deployed in the finance unit were generating a lot of earnings,” says a fund manager and longtime GE owner. “As they sell those down, they have to replace them with industrial earnings or share buybacks. There’s going to be a period of time where earnings will be stagnant ... The Street will get bored waiting."Previously: GE's move away from finance sets up industrial deals, Immelt says (April 10)Previously: GE sets plan to exit almost all of GE Capital; launches $50B buyback (April 10) Apr. 11, 2015, 9:21 AM | 128 Comments
GE's move away from finance sets up industrial deals, Immelt says
With GE planning to sell the bulk of its GE Capital unit, CEO Jeff Immelt says he plans to spend as much as $5B/year to expand its industrial portfolio through deals in oil and gas, healthcare and aviation.While the pending $13B acquisition of Alstom’s energy assets may curb its appetite for large deals, GE surely will seek to take advantage of the shakeout in the oil market from the collapse in global prices.GE now says its main manufacturing units will generate more than 90% of earnings by 2018, up from 58% last year; what’s still to be determined is whether earnings from the industrial units combined with a buyback will produce comparable earnings with a higher multiple, analysts say.GE rose 10.8% in today's trade on the assumption it will.

GE downgraded at Moody's; shares now up 4.5%
GE's move to exit nearly all banking-type operations by 2018 and return a bundle of cash to shareholders reflects a growing level risk tolerance in favor of equity holders versus creditors, says Moody's, downgrading the company's unsecured debt rating to A1 from Aa3."GE has been increasing cash payments to shareholders for several years but has not yet achieved a commensurate increase in operating earnings and cash flow," says Moody's Russell Solomon. While the company had previously promised restraint in further distributions to owners when it announced the Alstom purchase, today's announcement of $90B in payouts over the next three years is a "decisive indication that the company's financial policies have shifted to a more aggressive posture."The stock's higher by 4.5% premarket.Previously: GE sets plan to exit almost all of GE Capital; launches $50B buyback (April 10) Apr. 10, 2015, 7:30 AM | 31 Comments
GE sets plan to exit almost all of GE Capital; launches $50B buyback
GE decides the time is right to get out the banking business and plans to sell nearly all GE Capital assets over the next 24 months, excepting the financing verticals relating to the company's industrial businesses - GE Capital Aviation Services, Energy Financial Services, and Healthcare Equipment Finance.As part of the plan and as leaked yesterday, GE agrees to the sale of nearly all of the assets of GE Capital Real Estate to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). GE also has LOIs from other buyers for another $4B in property. The total amount of the sales comes to about $26.5B.Under the restructuring, GE expects more than 90% of its earnings will be generated by industrial businesses by 2018 - that's up from 58% last year.For 2015, the company's industrial businesses remain on track to generate operating EPS of $1.10-$1.20.GE has identified the potential to return $90B to shareholders in dividends, buybacks, and the Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) separation through 2018, and has authorized a new buyback program of up to $50B. The company expects to reduce share count to 8B-8.5B by 2018 (it's currently 10B).Shares +1.8% premarket. Apr. 10, 2015, 6:46 AM | 70 Comments

GE's Immelt touts conglomerate's scale but notes need to reduce banking ops
In his annual letter to shareholders, GE (GE +1.6%) CEO Jeffrey Immelt says he plans to stick by his company's model for housing diverse businesses under one roof even as other U.S. conglomerates are looking to shed units."The value of the GE Store is captured by faster growth at higher margins; it makes the totality of GE more competitive than the parts," Immelt writes, also citing examples such as how the company can use aircraft engine alternators to improve motors for pumping oil.At the same time, the letter says GE is focused on making its massive GE Capital banking operations - whose returns have fallen below the company's cost of capital - smaller and more connected to GE’s industrial businesses.Immelt says GE's new LEAP jet engine and H-class gas turbine will generate $100B in combined revenue over their lives, and that the company will register at least $1B in sales in Ghana this year, joining 22 other countries.

GE reportedly weighing deeper cuts to banking business
GE is considering making deeper cuts in its banking business, deciding that returns from lending are no longer worth the opposition it provokes among investors, Dow Jones reports.While the company has long committed to shrinking GE Capital, it has also viewed a smaller, safer banking business as an integral part of a conglomerate; but now, GE is believed to see the bulk of the lending operation as severable, similar to how the company viewed its appliances business which it sold last year.The reassessment comes as CEO Jeff Immelt is under pressure to remake GE as a more focused industrial company and win over investors, but scaling back GE Capital would mean sacrificing a unit that generated $2.3B in profit last year.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt earned ~8% increases in his salary and cash bonus in 2014, with his salary rising to $3.75M and his cash bonus moving to $5.4M, according to an SEC filing.The GE compensation committee says Immelt "performed very well" in 2014, although GE shares fell ~10% for the year, underperforming gains for the broader U.S. stock market; the CEO is praised in the proxy for hitting company goals such as making progress in tilting GE's earnings toward industrial manufacturing and away from its finance operations.Immelt's total 2014 compensation nearly doubled to $37.2M, with much of the increase coming from a big jump in the value of his pension; without the change in pension value, the CEO's compensation was valued at $18.85M, down 2% from 2013, Mar. 10, 2015, 7:08 PM | 57 Comments

GE and Statoil (NYSE:STO) launch an R&D partnership to work on ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions, in a bid to show that fossil fuels can have a long-term future under increasingly tough climate regulations.The two companies are seeking technologies that can reduce emissions and cut costs, for example by reducing the wasteful flaring of associated gas released during oil production, FT reports.The partnership is a first for GE’s oil and gas services division, which believes technologies to cut the use of fuel and other resources will prove commercially attractive at a time of weak oil prices.

GE's relative price weakness offers buying opportunity, Argus says
GE (GE +0.2%) has underperformed the S&P 500 YTD, and Argus analysts think the recent weakness has created a buying opportunity based on current valuation.The analysts see the higher-margin backlog, solid execution in the industrial businesses, and a healthier GE Capital as strong positives, and believes improving power generation activity has fueled demand for turbines and other oil and gas equipment, and an upswing in the commercial aviation market is flowing through to GE Aviation's order book.On the other hand, J.P. Morgan is not feeling so optimistic about GE's prospects, seeing further negative fundamental catalysts on oil and gas and earnings revisions. Jan. 26, 2015, 2:19 PM | 13 Comments

GE plans to "play offense" in weak oil environment, CFO says
Even as the steep drop in oil prices raises questions about the prospects for GE's (GE +1.2%) oil business, CFO Jeff Bornstein says the company will "play offense" and separate itself from rivals offering oil equipment and services.GE's oil and gas unit performed “as expected” during Q4, with sales falling 5.6% and operating profit up 1.5%; GE says it is starting to receive customer calls about the pricing of previously booked orders for oil exploration and production equipment, but not an onslaught - "That's to come in 2015," the CFO says. "Having said that, we’re going to play offense... like crazy in 2015."Bornstein says GE, which has spent $14B on deals to build its oil business since 2007, is even open to further acquisition opportunities, pointing out that "a lot of these companies are worth 30%-40% less than they were five months ago."Earlier: General Electric beats expectations Jan. 23, 2015, 3:30 PM | 13 Comments

GE rated Buy at UBS on positive long-term outlook for reduced GE Capital
GE is awarded a Buy rating and $30 price target a day ahead of its earnings report by UBS, which favorably views the plan to further shrink GE Capital but that it creates a "divot" in consolidated EPS until greater excess capital can be released, likely in 2017 or later.The firm says the pressure on consolidated EPS growth from the GE Capital shrinkage makes GE look like an unwieldy giant that cannot grow, but the company is transforming, its industrial earnings growth is strong, and tangible equity at GE Capital is rising.

Alstom confirms full-year targets
After posting a 10% quarterly sales jump at its remaining rail arm, Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY) announced that it struck additional commercial agreements with GE (NYSE:GE) worth €400M ($463.2M), which should help the group mitigate the impact of its recent $772M U.S. fine over bribery allegations.The DOJ has required Alstom to foot the bill. CEO Patrick Kron previously said the overall negative impact would only be around 1-2% of the GE deal, thanks to positive adjustments, including fees GE will pay to use the Alstom brand.Yesterday, EU antitrust regulators set a Feb. 23 deadline for a decision on the €12.35B acquisition.Alstom also reiterated its targets for the full year for single digit organic sales growth and an operating margin exceeding 5%.

Bill Nygren likes Chesapeake Energy and GE
"If you think the long-term price of oil is going to be $45 per barrel, there's basically nothing in this sector it makes any sense to own," Oakmark Funds' Bill Nygren tells CNBC, but he quickly adds he doesn't expect that. Checking futures out five years, the price is $70 per barrel, and a look at cost of production - near $70 - means production is going to be shutting down at current prices.One energy sector pick is Chesapeake Energy (CHK +5%). There's a stale perception of the stock, says Nygren, of a company designed to grow the top line as much as possible. But new management is laser-focused on maximizing rate of return, and their work at deleveraging the balance sheet is now allowing buybacks.Nygren's also liking General Electric (GE -0.4%), noting its underperformance - nearly 2000 basis points over the past year - and discounted valuation means the company only has to be average for the stock to go up. He also takes note of the new CFO as changing the focus to cash returns rather than reported earnings. Jan. 14, 2015, 3:49 PM | 14 Comments

GE cut to Hold from Buy at Deutsche Bank as earnings headwinds prevail
General Electric (GE -1.4%) is downgraded to Hold from Buy with a $28 price target, down from $30, at Deutsche Bank, which sees the collapse in energy prices as likely to provide an incremental challenge to GE both directly and indirectly.The firm believes GE is on the right strategic track in continuing to focus on structural and operating cost reduction, shrinking GE Capital and improving overall efficiency, but sees the merits of GE's simplification and restructuring proportionately offsetting GE Capital downsizing and still challenged global power generation markets.

GE's Alstom purchase shows corruption need not be a deal killer
This week’s settlement with Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY) over its bribery schemes appears to mean that there's little cause for worry when buying a company with a history of corruption around the world as long as the company’s sins look to be in its past.GE will not need to worry about Alstom’s $772M criminal fine when it buys most of the French company next year, according to the U.S. Department of Justice; in fact, as part of guilty plea deal reached with Alstom, prosecutors "insisted” that none of the penalty be passed to back to GE.Prosecutors let GE off the hook even though allegations of Alstom’s bribe schemes were known for years, but one goal of DoJ enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act actually is to encourage the sale of companies that have engaged in misconduct.

Halliburton's dubious distinction: Stock's post-deal performance worst YTD
Halliburton’s (NYSE:HAL) $34.6B buyout of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) has caused HAL shares to plunge 12% since the deal was announced Monday, the worst two-day performance for an acquirer’s stock this year; on average, a company announcing a deal has seen its stock pop 3.1% on the news.But analysts say the deal may present game-changing opportunities for a few small and mid-cap oilfield services firms with enough cash on hand to buy a chunk of HAL's expected divestments without diluting their stock or damaging their credit rating.Tudor Pickering Holt's Jeff Tillery speculates that Forum Energy Technologies (NYSE:FET), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and GE would be interested in HAL's manufacturing businesses that may come up for bid, while Superior Energy Services (NYSE:SPN) and Frank's International (NYSE:FI) might want certain services-oriented businesses.Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) would seem like a logical buyer of some assets and could make it happen with a mix of cash and stock, but RBC's Kurt Hallead thinks HAL might not want to cooperate with a company that could essentially become what Baker Hughes was.

Halliburton-Baker Hughes hookup likely to spark more energy M&A
In the wake of Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) $34.6B offer for Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), it appears the next hot sector for M&A action is energy: More consolidation is likely, given the weakness for stocks in the oilfield services subsector, low interest rates, and as a drop in demand for oil increases cutthroat pricing competition.Speculation is running rampant as investors try to figure out who is next in an industry that is sure to undergo some more consolidation; some names identified as possible candidates include Kodiak Oil and Gas (NYSE:KOG), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Northern Oil and Gas (NYSEMKT:NOG), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD).GE could go after National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) to show it is serious about the energy industry after last year’s purchase of pumpmaker Lufkin, Royal Bank of Canada says, and Oppenheimer says even BP could be an acquisition candidate.But Morgan Stanley does not see offshore drillers getting in on the action, as larger players like Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO), Transocean (NYSE:RIG) and Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) are still addressing dividend concerns while smaller companies such as Atwood Oceanics (NYSE:ATW) and Pacific Drilling (NYSE:PACD) still trade close to replacement value.

Barron's Sears suggests ways to play potential for GE breakup
Some analysts lately have been calling for a breakup of GE, most notably Barclays' Scott Davis, who says GE might try to regain its lost luster by breaking itself into smaller listed companies, as AT&T once did.Davis wants the company to completely shed all parts of its GE Capital business (which GE has started to do), and thinks spinning off GE's medical devices business also should be on the table; basically, anything that's not part of GE's global infrastructure related divisions - energy, aviation, transportation - could be fair game to go.Barron's Steven Sears suggests selling GE puts and buying long-dated calls in anticipation that investor pressure rises for GE to simplify its operations and even break itself up into many companies that are easier to value.

GE Hitachi’s ESBWR earns NRC design certification approval
The GE-Hitachi Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor design was approved yesterday by the NRC, allowing power companies to use it in nuclear plants they may build.GE (GE +0.2%) is the majority owner with a 60% share in the venture, and GE has the right of first refusal for any new nuclear plant project anywhere in the world outside of Japan.So far, two power companies have picked the ESBWR technology for planned reactors: DTE Energy will use it for a project in Michigan, and Dominion Resources for one in Virginia.The move probably is not a short-term GE stock mover, but it is "one more foundation building block that can... add billions and billions in new revenues down the road," writes 24/7's Jon Ogg.

Statoil, partners to expand effort to put flared natural gas to use
Statoil (NYSE:STO) says it will expand the use of technology that allows it to power equipment with natural gas that it otherwise would burn off, in an effort to address an ongoing challenge facing producers in the Bakken.When Bakken producers extract crude oil from the ground, they also get natural gas, but they often flare the gas instead of trying to ship it or sell it because gas prices are low and transportation infrastructure in the area is lacking.STO says the expanded program will enable it to capture 3M-5M cf/day of natural gas.STo is working with GE and others in developing the technology, which has been tested in North Dakota for eight months; the companies say the expansion marks the first step toward wider commercial adoption across the energy industry.

Around the time GE was closing a deal to buy Alstom's power business in France, the company was already discussing the possibility of selling its U.S. appliance business to Electrolux (OTC:ELUXF, OTCPK:ELUXY), and WSJ says the length of the courtship indicates the talks may be further along than thought.GE's Appliance and Lighting unit reported $381M in profit in 2013 on sales of $8.3B, making it the third-smallest of GE's seven industrial business lines by revenue, but that also makes it a prime target for sale as GE tries to pare low-margin businesses and focus its efforts on such heavy industrial products as jet engines, power turbines and oil industry equipment.LG Electronics and Samsung also are said to be in the mix of possible buyers, and Quirky Inc. reportedly has teamed up with Blackstone to work on a possible bid.

Caterpillar locomotive market share may fall far behind GE
Due to new stricter U.S. locomotive emission standards, freight train manufacturers are facing pressure to update their product lines by January 1. The result of the new legislation may lead Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to fall far behind GE (NYSE:GE) in the race to produce locomotives that comply with the new standards.Caterpillar's famous Electro-Motive Diesel unit announced that its freight trains will not be ready until 2017, paving a clear path for GE to obtain an increased market share.GE is already testing locomotives that conform to the new regulations, and is looking to snatch Caterpillar's customers during its two-year absence from the market. GE already has an estimated 60% to 70% of the domestic freight train market.The concerns don't particularly bother Caterpillar, which expects companies to delay buying new locomotives until the technology is perfected. "History indicates that the railroads are slow to adopt new technology until it is fully proven in the field," says a Caterpillar spokeswoman. Caterpillar will also have overseas sales, which reached $2.5B last year, to make up for the time it will be locked out of the U.S. market. Jul. 14, 2014, 9:15 AM | 12 Comments

Column: Jeff Immelt is the American Canada needs to lead oil sands clean-up
The problem facing Canada isn't the Keystone pipeline or Pres.

The deal involves two separate contracts.For the first contract, Casa dos Ventos is looking to buy $366M of turbines, to replace a previous delivery from Enercon GmbH’s Wobben Windpower, which the latter stated it will not be able to fulfill.The second deal will be decided within the next two weeks, as Casa dos Ventos determines whether to buy an additional 150MW of turbines worth $238M for a possible wind park acquisition. That contract hinges on a guarantee from GE to deliver the turbines before 2015, when the project needs to be fully operational for the government of Brazil.By the end of this year, GE will be the top turbine supplier in Brazil, with a 24% market share.ETFs: BRXX Jun. 30, 2014, 10:40 AM | 2 Comments

Boeing -1% as McCarthy calls for letting U.S. Export-Import Bank expire
Boeing (BA) slid 1% today after Kevin McCarthy, the new no. 2 man for the Republicans in the House, said yesterday on the TV talk show circuit that he would not support renewing the charter of the Export-Import Bank.The Depression-era program helps exporters by guaranteeing loans to buyers overseas and providing credit insurance, and has helped finance sales of Boeing Dreamliners to India, Poland and Ethiopia; GE has used the bank to sell trains to Pakistan, and Caterpillar (CAT) relies on the Ex-Im Bank to finance foreign buyers of its heavy equipment.Delta Air Lines (DAL), however, opposes reauthorization of the bank and says taxpayers shouldn’t make it easier for foreign competitors to buy jets.Eric Cantor, who recently lost his primary election and resigned his House leadership post, had supported Ex-Im and helped broker a deal to reauthorize the bank in 2012.

France obtains Alstom stake, clears GE deal
The last remaining element to the General Electric (GE)-Alstom (ALSMY) deal has now been complete, after the French government secured its 20% stake in Alstom from Bouygues (BOUYF). Bouygues will lend the shares to the French state, in order for the government to become an immediate shareholder.After being ousted from the the deal, Siemens (SIEGY) CEO Joe Kaeser says he's still ready to negotiate with Alstom should the agreement between GE and the power equipment company fall apart.Previous coverage Jun. 23, 2014, 2:25 AM | 1 Comment
Alstom's board accepts GE bid
After receiving the French government's blessing on Friday, General Electric's (GE) improved bid has been officially accepted by Alstom's (ALSMY) board. The approval marks an end to the bidding war between GE and Siemens (SIEGY)-Mitsubishi (MHVYF).The closing of the deal is still contingent upon the French government finding an agreement with Bouygues (BOUYF). The former wishes to buy a 20% stake in Alstom before allowing GE to buy the group. After the French state purchases its 20% stake, Alstom will be left as a holding company, paving the way for three 50-50 joint ventures with GE.Once the deal is closed, Alstom will then buy GE's train signalling business.The approved offer still values the power equipment company at $17B, but prices the Alstom investment in the joint-ventures at $3.4B.

GE set to prevail in its bid for Alstom, but some see a Pyrrhic victory
GE is the apparent winner in the contest for Alstom (ALSMY), shutting out Siemens (SIEGY) and Mitsubishi (MHVYF), as the French government has given its blessing to GE’s offer while buying a 20% stake for itself - which means GE is now effectively going into business with the French state.In the ~$13.5B deal, GE would acquire Alstom’s natural gas turbine operations along with its valuable customer base while selling to Alstom its railroad signaling business, and 50-50 joint ventures would be created for steam turbines, renewable energy and electrical grid systems.The concessions will mean a smaller boost to GE's profit and fewer cost savings from the deal, and could complicate decision making in situations where the French government feels it has an interest, a William Blair analyst says.GE's Jeffrey Immelt says it's not the straight takeover of the energy business he had envisioned, but that 86% of the deal's synergies - essentially the value of the energy business - were outside of the joint ventures.Alstom's board is due to decide on the deal by Monday, when GE's binding offer expires.

Siemens, Mitsubishi update Alstom bid
Confirming earlier reports, Siemens (SIEGY) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHVYF) have improved their offer for Alstom's (ALSMY) energy business. The updated bid follows General Electric's (GE) new offer made to the French government yesterday.Siemens and Mitsubishi will now pay €8.2B ($11.2B) in cash, in place of their last bid of €7B. This will value Alstom at €14.6B, which is well above GE's €12.4B. Siemens has also expressed it is willing from the start to enter a mobility management joint venture with Alstom.Increasing its stake, Mitsubishi is now offering a 40% purchase in Alstom's steam, grid and hydro business, raising its cash payment €3.9B from €3.1. Previously, Mitsubishi planned on creating three joint ventures with Alstom. Jun. 20, 2014, 2:55 AM | 4 Comments

WSJ: GE considers selling train signal business to Alstom
GE (GE +0.1%) is considering selling its train signaling business to Alstom (ALSMY), as it seeks ways to improve the appeal of its $17B offer for the French company's energy business, WSJ reports.A direct sale would send GE beyond its initial proposal outlined last month by CEO Jeffrey Immelt during a parliamentary hearing in France to consider pooling its signaling operations with Alstom's into a joint venture.GE may propose to Alstom that it choose between a direct purchase and a joint venture, which would allow the maker of France's TGV bullet trains to decide whether it would rather conserve cash for other acquisitions or spend a chunk of it on buying GE's signaling unit.

Bloomberg: GE refining jobs, nuclear plans in Alstom deal
GE (GE +0.2%) is in talks with the French government to refine guarantees on jobs, planned investments and access to nuclear technology to distinguish its $17B bid for Alstom’s (ALSMY) energy assets from Siemens' (SIEGY) offer, Bloomberg reports.In trying to meet France's demands for a better offer, GE is said to promise an independent audit to ensure it honors a pledge to create 1,000 industrial jobs in France as part of a deal, and may be willing to make commitments for future spending on France-based operations.While GE will not increase the cash part of its offer, it appears willing to continue discussions about several areas, including ensuring that French interests retain access to nuclear technology and a possible GE-Alstom partnership in railroad signaling.Meanwhile, other reports say the French government is willing to take a stake of 10% or more in Alstom alongside Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHVYF) as part of the Japanese firm's joint offer with Siemens.

"I think that GE is also going to improve its offer."GE has already offered $16.9B for all of Alstom's energy assets with the promise to create 1,000 new jobs in France within three years. Siemens and Mitsubishi will disclose their bid by tomorrow, although it looks like they will only be offering $12.3B in cash.It remains to be seen what General Electric will add to their bid, as GE Vice Chairman John Rice stated Friday his company will pursue its bid alone.

Reuters: Siemens, Mitsubishi finalize Alstom offer
Siemens (SIEGY) and Mitsubishi (MHVYF) reportedly are putting the finishing touches on a joint offer for Alstom's (ALSMY) turbine businesses that includes ~€9B cash.GE has offered €12.35B ($16.9B) for all of Alstom's energy assets, including turbines, renewables and grid operations, but a source tells Reuters "the offer can't be compared with that of GE as they're so different in nature."Under the complex proposal, Alstom would have a future in the energy business and be at the center of a European rail champion - both potentially attractive prospects for the French government - but would turn Alstom into an unwieldy holding company with stakes in disparate businesses, which may make it difficult to convince Paris that its deal is a jobs creator.

New pollution rules should prove profitable for GE’s turbine business
Likely among the clear winners in the EPA's new carbon framework will be engineering giants General Electric (GE) and Siemens (SIEGY); every utility that moves to overhaul a gas plant with more efficient turbines, or makes the bigger switch to natural gas from coal, could represent a customer for those companies’ high-efficiency turbines.GE only sold a few of its top of the line gas-fueled power turbines in the U.S. last year, continuing a streak going back more than a decade, but new regulations on carbon emissions could eventually mean better results.For Siemens and some of its industrial peers, the government’s push for more efficiency could prove profitable in other ways, if it spurs capital investment in energy monitoring and efficiency systems they also make.

I did mention the [job] numbers reported, but at the same time emphasized that some positions could be put to work elsewhere."It's not clear whether the comments might hurt Siemens' chances of winning Alstom's (ALSMY) power assets away from GE, but the headlines can't help his cause in France, particularly after GE's Jeff Immelt promised to create 1,000 new engineering and manufacturing jobs if his company wins the deal.

GE is willing to partner with France's government in a possible alliance, CEO Jeffrey Immelt told French lawmakers today, as he tried to win their support for GE's bid for Alstom's (ALSMY) power equipment business.Immelt didn't offer specifics, but GE hadn't previously stated a willingness to a government investment in a business resulting from any acquisition of Alstom's assets.A GE spokesman says the company is not offering the French government a stake in the steam turbine business; French Economy Minister Montebourg is worried that a GE deal could disrupt the supply of Alstom turbines to Electricité de France (ECIFF), which uses them to make France's world-class nuclear reactors.Immelt said today GE understands the "importance of the sovereignty of the nuclear industry" in France, adding that GE had been working with EDF for decades.Siemens' (SIEGY) Christophe de Maistre told the lawmakers today that his company's eventual bid would spawn two separate companies: a power equipment firm and a train giant that would combine Alstom's high-speed train operations with Siemens' rolling-stock business.

GE oil chief sees more growth even with Alstom deal
GE's (GE +0.8%) $16.9B bid for Alstom's power business won't slow down GE's oil and gas division, according to the head of the unit, even though such a transaction could preclude any more big deals for GE until after next year.Revenue at the unit has jumped more than 80% to nearly 17% over the past four years, but the size of the Alstom bid could mean less investment at other GE units; GE brass have promised that the deal, if completed, would effectively use up most of what the company has set aside for M&A this year and next.But GE Oil & Gas President Lorenzo Simonelli shrugs off such concerns, and expects the unit to increase revenue at a high single-digit percentage rate in the coming years.

Alstom considering GE's railway signaling division
Alstom (ALSMY, AOMFF) is interested in taking over GE's railway signaling business as part of the current talks over the sale of its power division, CEO Patrick Kron says.Kron's comments echo the request made by the French economy minister, who suggested earlier this week that GE transfer its railway division to Alstom, but railway signaling is a crucial business with high profit margins that GE may be loathe to cut loose.GE also manufactures locomotives for freight trains in the U.S., but Kron says Alstom isn't interested.

France says it opposes GE’s bid for Alstom unit
The French government formally declares its opposition to GE’s (GE -0.4%) friendly $13.5B offer for Alstom's (ALSMY, AOMFF) energy assets, saying in a letter to GE that the deal should be reconfigured on a more equitable footing.The government’s legal means for stopping a deal appears limited, though it could refuse to approve such an investment on national security grounds; economy minister Montebourg notes in his letter that the government was Alstom’s most important customer.Alstom’s energy units, which make turbines for nuclear, coal and gas power plants, as well as the grid infrastructure to deliver electricity, contribute ~75% of its €20B (~$30B) in the company’s annual sales.

Investors weigh good news/bad news nature of GE's bid for Alstom assets
GE (GE -0.4%) shares have gained just 1.7% since the news first broke that it was considering a bid for Alstom (ALSMY, AOMFF) energy assets, perhaps reflecting the good news/bad news nature of a potential deal, according to Morgan Stanley's Nigel Coe.The bearish view holds that GE is heavily increasing exposure to a more commoditized area of the power generation spectrum (coal, hydro, transmission), the acquisition of a large European competitor carries significant “clash of culture” risks, and there's the potential for large project write-downs and restructuring programs.On the other hand, coal generation is not going away any time soon with installed base growth comparable to gas over the next 20 years, and the service annuity on Alstom’s substantial installed base of coal and steam turbines accounts for the majority of the transaction value, Coe says.

Iran would buy 400 new commercial jets if sanctions eased
Iran would purchase 400 new aircraft over 10 years if sanctions were lifted, the country's top aviation official reportedly says. The country has been banned from purchasing new Western airliners since the 1970s.Of Iran's 250 commercial planes, about 150 are flying and the rest are "not functional" because of a lack of spare parts. The average age of the nation's commercial fleet is 22 years.Under the recent deal with the international community over its nuclear program, Iran is allowed to acquire spare parts and services on a limited basis.Companies that could benefit from Iran being allowed to buy aircraft include Boeing (BA), Airbus (EADSY), Bombardier (BDRAF), Embraer (ERJ), GE (GE) and Rolls-Royce (RRCEF).

GE's Immelt to meet French Industry Minister over Alstom deal
GE (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt is due to meet French Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg today to discuss the company's possible bid for Alstom's (ALSMY) energy assets. The deal could be announced tomorrow.Although the state doesn't have a stake in Alstom, the company is considered a national champion, while the government wants guarantees about jobs, especially with unemployment so high.To make any deal more palatable, it would exclude Alstom's transport business, which produces the iconic TGV train.The transaction has the support of Bouygues (BOUYF), Bloomberg reports. Bouygues owns 29% of Alstom.Meanwhile, the news-wire service compares GE's bid for Alstom with its ill-fated $53B attempt to acquire Honeywell 13 years ago in a deal that floundered on EU antitrust opposition. GE's success in receiving authorization for its acquisition of Italian aerospace company Avio last year shows "that it is able to work with regulators," says Brussels lawyer Paul McGeown.

The TBTFs join to fight proposed bank tax
Half a million doesn't buy much anymore. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R, Mich.) - a sizable recipient of Wall Street donations - has the large financial institutions displeased with his proposal to levy a tax on them. He says they deserve to pay up for the lower borrowing costs they receive because of their perceived government backstop, a notion the banks dispute.The proposal is part of larger tax reform expected to get serious discussion after the mid-term elections, and a Camp spokeswoman says the overall plan will make banks "some of the biggest winners."In discussions to hold a fundraiser for the NRC, Goldman Sachs (GS +0.9%) reportedly opted out over its concerns. Smaller bankers join in with their much larger brethren: "We're going to beat this like a rented mule," says Cam Fine, who heads the Independent Community Bankers Association. "This is a united effort."Camp's tax would apply to financial firms with assets greater than $500B, levying a 0.035% tax on total assets each year. Among those affected (in addition to Goldman) are AIG, BAC, C, GE Capital, JPM MET, MS, PRU, and WFC. The largest could pay more than $2B per year under the plan.

GE could be the next target of activist investors, which is one reason CEO Jeffrey Immelt invited Nelson Peltz to speak with his senior management team a few months ago, according to Fox's Charlie Gasparino.GE confirms a meeting discussing broad market events took place last August, but insiders reportedly say Peltz discussed shareholder activism and specifically what a shareholder activist might want out of GE management, including where the company can cut staff and what pieces could be sold off to spark the stock price.Gasparino says it’s unclear how worried GE management is over being a target of activists; GE recently announced plans to spin off its credit card unit, it raised its dividend last year and has been buying back shares, all moves intended to appease investors.

GE in $660M deal to build locomotives for South African rail company
General Electric (GE +1.1%) says it won a contract to build 233 diesel locomotives for South Africa's state-owned Transnet rail company over three and a half years for 7.1B rand ($660M), part of a $4.7B commitment to buy more than 1,000 locomotives from various manufacturers as part of sweeping infrastructure upgrades.Ge says the core parts of the locomotives including the engines will be made in the U.S. and the machines will be assembled at a facility in South Africa.China's CSR Zhuzhou Electric and a local subsidiary of Canada's Bombardier (BDRBF) will split most of the rest of the order to build ~600 electric locomotives.

GE consumer credit spinoff could boost multiple
GE's North American retail credit unit is primarily a consumer credit card business and accounted for $9.4B of GE Capital's $44B in revenue in 2013 (GE overall had $146B in revenue). So while it's relatively small, the spinoff (with new name Synchrony Financial SYF) will reduce exposure to the ups and downs of consumer spending, writes Dimitra Defotis in Barron's.By becoming less of a bank - CEO Immelt hopes for GE Capital to account for one-third of earnings next year vs. 40% in 2013 - GE could fetch a higher multiple, he suggests, noting the stock trades at about 15x estimated 2014 earnings vs. a more pure-play industrial player like Danaher at 20x.Earlier coverage Mar. 14, 2014, 11:03 AM
GE's consumer finance IPO is net positive but no game-changer, analyst says
GE's move to IPO its consumer credit card business is a "net positive" for the company but not a panacea, according to Bernstein's Steven Winoker.The analyst thinks GE investors over time will favor the higher industrial earnings weighting, provided management keeps share buyback promises; overall, he believes those earnings deserve a much higher multiple than banking earnings.Still, Winoker is no fan of GE, which he rates as Market Perform with a $28 price target: He thinks the stock looks pricey trading at a 40% premium to tangible book for GE Capital and 17x 2014-15 earnings, and GE Capital likely won’t start growing until 2016.

GE raises $3B in bonds
General Electric (GE) has taken advantage of continued low rates with a $3B bond sale comprising $2.25B of 30-year notes and $750M in 10-year paper.The auction attracted strong demand, mainly due to the not-so-common opportunity to buy debt from the parent company rather than GE Capital. The last time the parent sold bonds was in October 2012.GE is rate at AA+ at S&P.Meanwhile, following shareholder feedback, GE will end dividend payments to senior management on new stock that has yet to vest.ETFs: LQD, VCSH, VCIT, CORP, VCLT, CSJ, CIU, CFT, SCPB, LWC, CLY, ITR, QLTA, IGHG, PFIG, SLQD, ENGN, IGS, CBND, QLTB, IGU Mar. 7, 2014, 2:14 AM | 4 Comments
GE +1.8% as Jeff Immelt spends his entire 2013 cash bonus on shares
CEO Jeff Immelt demonstrates his confidence in GE (GE +1.8%) by investing his entire 2013 cash bonus in GE shares, picking up ~105K shares yesterday for more than $2.64M and following a purchase of 40K shares last week for ~$1M.However, it's a relatively small portion of the 1.9M shares Immelt owns directly in GE; “considering he’s been the CEO for about a decade and been paid a lot of money, that’s not particularly impressive,” says Alan Johnson, head of a compensation consulting firm.Chief executives sometimes spend their own money on company stock as a way to shore up investor confidence; it's worked for at least a day, and GE investors hope for a repeat of Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman's 2012 purchase of 100K shares that's netted him ~$1M in paper profit.

Study names 26 firms that paid no income tax for five years
Twenty-six out of 288 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid no federal income tax between 2008 and 2012, a report from the left-leaning activist group Citizens for Tax Justice shows.The firms include Boeing (BA), GE (GE), and Verizon Communications (VZ).The study adds that 111 firms paid no federal income tax in at least one of the five years.However, GE and other companies named dispute the report's findings. "For each year cited by Citizens for Tax Justice, GE paid income taxes in the U.S., as well as billions in other state, local and federal taxes in the U.S.," GE said.Boeing said its total effective 2013 tax rate was 26.4%, while Verizon said it paid over $2.9B in income taxes from 2008-2012.CTJ's report comes as GOP House member David Camp gets set to introduce an overhaul of the tax code.

GE moves closer to IPO of GE Capital
GE is expected to file for the IPO of its consumer finance unit - GE Capital - in the next two months, reports the FT, and has hired Goldman and JPMorgan to lead the push.The unit could be valued at more than $20B and the sale of about 20% means a $4B listing and the largest IPO since Facebook raised $16.1B in May 2012. The remainder of the unit would be spun off to GE shareholders in 2015.Back in the day, cynics could call GE a bank that happened to sell aircraft parts and such, but no more. The exit from consumer finance would be the completion of a post-crisis restructuring plan to return to the company's manufacturing roots.The GE Capital sale would be the latest in a fast line of consumer finance offerings, including the IPOs of Santander Consumer U.S. and Springleaf Financial. "[It's] a good time to exit this business," said GE Capital chief Keith Sherin recently. "The capital markets are pretty strong." Jan. 31, 2014, 1:28 PM | 21 Comments

Double-dip: GE buys Cameron unit, Citi removes from Focus List
Investors didn't seem too thrilled with GE's $550M purchase yesterday of Cameron's (CAM) reciprocating compression division, sending GE shares more than 1% lower today.For CAM, Sterne Agee views the asset sale (and likely additional sales) as positive but believes execution of its core businesses will be the key to success in 2014; while asset sales could prompt some modest downside to its 2014-15 EPS estimates of $3.90 and $5.00, the firm sees CAM's aggressive approach to buying back stock in Q4 indicating confidence in its operations and execution.Citigroup removes GE from its Focus List, not because of the purchase but due to its earnings: GE unexpectedly fell 10 bps short of its 2013 target of 70 bps of operating margin growth, normally not a big deal "but since GE does not provide EPS guidance, this target had become a disproportionally key 2013 milestone in GE’s road to a transformational mix of 70/30 industrial/capital."

GE again falls short in consistently meeting its own financial targets
GE missed a key margin target touted by CEO Jeff Immelt last year: While Q4 profit climbed 4.8% thanks to improved sales of power turbines and airplane engines, GE fell short in its pledge to improve the operating profit margin in its industrial businesses.Four weeks ago, Immelt said GE was "on track" in its goal of improving its industrial operating margin by 70 bps last year; to achieve the goal, it aggressively cut costs, trimming $1.6B of expenses last year and planning another $1B cut this year, but the end result was a 66-point improvement.The margin goal has proven troublesome for a while: GE pared its target in 2012, pledging to make up the difference in 2013, and says it was on track until it was hit in Q4 by a quality problem with its wind turbine blades and issues related to marine power systems at its energy management unit (conference call).

Clean Energy Fuels teams with GE to boost natural gas-fueled trucks
Shares of Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE +3.7%) are strong after the company said it had struck a deal with GE Capital (GE +2.4%) that will help companies finance purchases and leases of natural gas-fueled trucks.The agreement would allow truck fleet operators to obtain natural gas fueling contracts with CLNE and then apply for loans and leases from GE Capital CLNE would then would help offset the monthly cost of a natural gas truck to make it comparable to the cost of a diesel truck.Analysts say the CLNE-GE arrangement would effectively remove the upfront capital differential that still favors diesel.

General Electric talks restructuring, margins, orders on Q3 call
GE CFO Jeff Bornstein on restructuring: "The more we get deeper into the simplification effort, we see increasing numbers of opportunities to take cost out of the company and make GE faster and more customer centric. I would say, the list is growing with time and we are in the early innings of the simplification effort."Barclays' Scott Davis regarding a 37% increase in equipment orders for Power and Water: "I wasn't aware that anybody in the world was buying a gas turbine right now." Jeff Immelt: "The order strength for our Power & Water has been around our aeroderivatives units. It has been very strong and our wind units have been incredibly strong ... if you look at Q4, we expect Power & Water orders to be at the high end of the range of what we talked about."Credit Suisse's Julian Mitchell: "The overall industrial margin was up 120 bps, services was up 60, so that means equipment was up 160 bps, 170 bps of flat revenues. When you think about the mix going forward ... do you think that kind of equipment margin growth is sustainable?" Jeff Immelt: "Yes ... I think, what I would say right now is that we are running ahead of the game on value gap."Earnings, Q3 summary, CC transcript

General Electric finally set to outperform: Barron's
14.5x current year earnings estimates is cheap for a late-cycle industrial heavyweight, Jack Hough writes, in this weekend's Barron's feature on General Electric (GE).Hough says the shares are set to rise 30% over the next two years as recovering demand for electricity buoys the struggling power and water business, where recent weakness has masked "double-digit gains in other units, like oil and gas, aviation, and transportation."Expected margin expansion also bodes well for the GE, as does the company's transition to "a seller of services rather than just equipment."Finally, Hough says the long-delayed consumer-lending spinoff could "find willing buyers" with the market "hitting new highs."

EPA's new carbon rules hurt coal, could accelerate shift to natural gas
Both critics and supporters of the new EPA draft regulations on CO2 emissions agree on one thing: This will be the final blow to many proposed coal plants.The truth is, U.S. coal generation already was in decline not because of climate regulations, but because of good ol' free-market capitalism; the boom in natural gas production has dramatically increased supplies, sent prices plummeting and prompted a shift away from coal.Among potential long-term winners: U.S. nat gas drillers such as CHK and XOM, drilling services firms such as HAL and BHI, pipeline companies such as SE and KMI, makers of gas-fired turbines such as GE and SI, power generators such as NRG and CPN if electricity prices rise.Likely losers: Coal appears headed for a decline, and companies with large Appalachian operations such as JRCC and ANR could suffer most as more coal comes from cheaper-to-access deposits in the Illinois Basin and Wyoming; big industrial companies, which have used low U.S. power prices as a competitive advantage, are concerned.ETFs: KOL, IDU, PUI, XLU, VPU, RYU, FXU, PSCU, UPW, SDP, UTLT.

Screening for dividend growth names
Dividend payers may be a good place to hide out from rising interest rates, but those stocks sporting the highest yields - telecoms and utilities - tend to have slow payment growth, making them less-attractive as rates rise. Checking back to the 1994 bond bear market, telecoms and utilities were among the market's worst performers.Better to shop for modest payers, but above-average payment growth. Barron's screens for those characteristics combined with reasonable overall valuation and turns up three names: Boeing (BA), CVS Caremark (CVS), and GE.Certain dividend ETFs employ this strategy as well, with Vanguard's Dividend Appreciation (VIG) - almost zero exposure to telecoms and utilities  - and WisdomTree's U.S. Dividend Growth ETF (DGRW) coming to mind. Others include DGRS, DNL, EMDG, DGRE.Other dividend ETFs: FDL, FVD, MDIV, QDF, QDYN, QDEF, DIV, CVY, DVY, HDV, IYLD, PEY, PFM, SCHD, SDY, SDYL, DVYL, VYM, DHS, DTD, SYLD, KBWD, SPHD, DLN, DON, HILO.Telecom and utility ETFs: IYZ, XTL, VOX, LTL, TLL, IDU, PUI, XLU, VPU, RYU, FXU, PSCU, UPW, SDP, UTLT.

Bloomberg: GE may target Dresser-Rand, Dril-Quip in energy push

The rationale: expectations of above-trend real GDP growth beginning next year (Mr. Evans' "escape velocity" ?) coupled with P/E multiple expansion to 16x. Furthermore, dividends should rise ~30% over the next two years, bolstering the firm's claim that dividend-paying equities (DVY) are one of the only places U.S. investors can look to for income-generation.

GE's planned purchase of pump maker Lufkin (LUFK) at the industry’s most expensive price tag highlights demand for oilfield equipment that may spark takeover interest from large-cap oilfield servicers for Weatherford (WFT), Flotek (FTK) and Tesco (TESO), Bloomberg writes.

A plan by General Electric (GE) to put 85K workers on a high-deductible health care plan in order to lowers its mult-billion dollar health costs falls in line with the trend of other major corporations, but not without a painful side effect.

GE (GE) and Comcast (CMCSA) make it official, announcing a $30B agreement to shift control of NBC Universal from GE to the Comcast. Details as expected: Comcast will control 51% of the new entity, for which it will pay $6B in cash and throw in its content assets. GE kicks in NBCU along with $9B in debt, and will buy out Vivendi's (VIVDY.PK) 20% stake in NBCU for $5.8B. (PR)

GE and Comcast (CMCSA) plan to announce their deal for NBC Universal tomorrow, WSJ reports. Comcast would head a new joint venture that will include the NBC TV network, more than a dozen cable nets and Universal Studios (the studio and the parks). Dec. 2, 2009, 3:16 PM
GE (GE) will delay paying Vivendi (VIVDY.PK) cash for its $5.8B purchase of Vivendi's stake in NBC Universal, sources say. Vivendi will only get its money once the Comcast (CMCSA) deal closes, which could take more than a year due to regulatory reviews. If the deal doesn't close by late 2010, Vivendi could be entitled to a payment of up to $2B from GE. Dec. 2, 2009, 8:23 AM
Comcast (CMCSA) may have to put up less cash to take control of NBC Universal, as the cable giant and GE have reportedly valued Comcast's cable channels at $6.5B-7B. Alternately, Comcast could take a greater portion of the venture's cash flow. The companies value NBCU's assets at near $30B. (GE, Vivendi come to terms) Dec. 1, 2009, 2:36 PM
GE (GE) and Vivendi (VIVDY.PK) come together on a tentative $5.8B deal for Vivendi's 20% stake in NBC Universal - roughly in between the two firms' last best offers. A finalized deal would clear the key obstacle to selling a majority share in the network to Comcast (CMCSA). Nov. 30, 2009, 8:21 PM

Talks between GE Corp.

GE and Comcast (CMCSA) had hoped to announce a deal as early as Monday, but sources say this could now be at least a week away, or perhaps not at all if Vivendi decides to pursue an IPO of its 20% stake in NBCU rather than sell it back to GE.

Exiting its 80% stake in NBC Universal would likely be dilutive to GE (GE), Citigroup says, pegging GE's stake in NBCU at $20B-$26B, which Citi says does not unlock any sum-of-parts value for GE. An exit would likely be spread out, but dilution could be $0.05-0.10/share if the stake were sold immediately.

Sources fill in details on Comcast's (CMCSA -6.4%) non-denial denial from earlier, saying a deal is in the works to get the cable operator 51% of NBC Universal (GE -2%), though its complexity means it's far from done. Some kind of NBCU spinoff is likely, though, as it's said GE's co-owner Vivendi is going to follow through on its annual November put option to get rid of its 20% stake. Oct. 1, 2009, 1:39 PM
Comcast (CMCSA -6.75%) denies reports it has struck a deal to buy NBC Universal from GE (GE -1.4%) for $35B.
