U.S. automakers accelerate incentive spending
J.D. Power and LMC Automotive jointly forecast that U.S. retail auto sales will rise 0.4% in February to 1.0331M units.Incentives as a percentage of manufacturer's suggested retail price are estimated to have jumped to 10.3%, the highest level for February since 2009. Selling an increased mix of higher-margin vehicles takes a bit of the sting out of the incentive spending.J.D./LMC's analysis: "Light-vehicle demand in the United States is tracking as expected and maintaining a strong overall level of demand. It’s influenced by variables that will be playing out as the year progresses, including level of economic growth, a potential border tax, lease maturities and the introduction of more than 60 new models. In addition, the balancing act between relatively high inventory levels and incentive spending will be closely watched as an indicator for the health of the auto industry."Related stocks: GM, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, FCAU, OTC:HYMLF.Related ETF: CARZ.

Crunching the border tax numbers in the U.S. auto sector
Baum & Associates pushes pencil to paper to estimate that automakers would need to lift vehicles prices by thousands of dollars per vehicle to counterbalance a border adjustment tax. Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are seen at the lower end, with estimated price hikes of $282 and $995, respectively. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could be mostly unaffected by a border adjustment tax due to its U.S. manufacturing focus.Meanwhile, the forecast for Volvo (OTCPK:GELYF), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY) and Jaguar Land Rover (NYSE:TTM) are on the extreme high end, with prices increases of $6K to $10K seen as needed to recoup a border tax cost.Barclays also tackled the border tax issue in a note published Friday.Barclay's Detroit Three border tax breakdown:  "Ford has a higher mix of its NA unit production in the U.S. vs. FCA and GM. But the starker difference lies in the estimated value of U.S. net imports – we estimate only $3.6bn for Ford, vs. $10.4bn for GM and $18bn for FCA. Indeed, Ford is largely importing low-value small/mid cars from Mexico, vs. FCA and GM, which manufacture high-value pickups in Mexico and CUVs/minivans in Canada."The firm rates Fiat and GM at Equal-weight along with the broad U.S. auto and auto parts sector, but has Ford positioned with an Overweight rating.Related stocks: HMC, TM, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTCPK:BMWYY, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:FUJHY.

Handicapping a potential U.S.-China trade war
Analysts disagree on if a trade war between the U.S. and China is a Black Swan event or a development with a more realistic chance of occurring. Most investment firms in the U.S. see the odds as very low, while in Asia the risk factor is given more weight.Credit Suisse is out with analysis on which companies are at risk either way.The investment firm says Nike (NKE -0.2%), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F -0.3%) and Tiffany (TIF -0.6%) could suffer if U.S. products are boycott in China, while U.S. sanctions place Chinese electronics exporters such as Lenovo Group (OTCPK:LNVGY, OTCPK:LNVGF) and ZTE Corp. (OTCPK:ZTCOF, OTCPK:ZTCOY) in harm's way.On a percentage basis, Ambarella (AMBA -1%), Texas Instruments (TXN +0.3%), Marvell (MRVL -0.4%), Genco Shipping & Trading (GNK +3.5%) and Diana Shipping (DSX +2%) are the larger U.S. companies that derive the most revenue from China.

EVs a long-term wildcard in the oil market
Electric vehicles are forecast to cut into oil demand by 1M-2M bbl/day by 2035, according to oil industry consultant Wood McKenzie.That estimate is actually much more conservative than Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s estimate for EVs to impact demand by 8M bbl/day by 2035. For perspective, OPEC agreed this week to coordinated production cuts of 1.2M bbl/day which swung crude oil prices wildly. EVs are only sipping up the equivalent of 50K bbl/day currently.The general consensus even in the oil industry is that governments are moving toward major changes with pollution and emissions regulations. Just this week, the cities of Paris, Mexico City, Madrid and Athens all said they would ban the use of diesel vehicles by 2025. Beijing is also slowly adopting pro-EV policies.A higher mix of EVs in the future has already been tipped off by the dramatic long-term electrification initiatives announced this year by companies such as BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY), Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota (NYSE:TM). Around the corner, Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have their mass model EVs ready to roll - while new EV trucks, buses and motorcycles are also on the way.WTI crude oil futures +1.21% to $51.68/bbl on Friday.

Trump overhang may be easing for automakers
A top Trump advisor says the President-elect will only use the threat of tariffs as a last resort.While the development isn't a shocker in the political world, a tariff overhang has lingered over Ford (F +0.3%) and Japanese automakers (OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTCPK:MMTOF) since the election.Some analysts thinks Trump is likely to face increased pushback on dismantling NAFTA from the business world after he sets up in the Oval Office.

Ultra-fast EV charging network planned for Europe
A charging network is being created in Europe through a group effort that includes BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF), Ford (F +0.4%) and Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY) brands Audi and Porsche.The group sees an "ultra-fast high-powered" charging network along major highways with power levels up to 350 kW.The initial build-up is planned to start next year with 400 sites across Europe. By 2020, thousands of high-powered charging points are expected.Stanphyl Capital's Mark Spiegel points out that the planned network is at 2X the speed of Tesla's superchargers. It's the same Spiegel who Bloomberg reports is discussing Tesla (TSLA -2.2%) as a short idea at the Robin Hood conference in NYC. Nov. 29, 2016, 1:03 PM | 205 Comments
Trump names DOT chief as automakers roll on with their plans
Elaine Chao is the pick of Donald Trump to be the Secretary of Transportation, according to numerous media outlets.Chao served in the cabinets of Bush 41 and Bush 43. Early analysis is that she may be a known quantiy to the Detroit Three (GM, F, FCAU) who worked closely with her on a post-9/11 task force and broadly during the Bush years.The big picture: There's been some concern over the impact of the Trump administration for EV sellers such as Tesla Motors (TSLA -1.9%), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) and Toyota (TM +0.7%) -- although the $7.5K federal tax break is already set to expire when automakers cross over the 200K U.S. EV sale mark. Federal fuel efficiency targets could be rolled back after Trump takes office, although some industry watchers think manufacturers are too far along in their EV, ridesharing and mobility projects to put the genie back in the bottle.

The WardsAuto Fuel Economy Index for vehicles sold in the U.S. in October increased 0.5% Y/Y to 25.1 mpg (9.4 L/100 km).The slightly higher percentage of electrics and plug-in hybrids sold didn't offset the impact of a shift in mix to larger SUVs and trucks.A separate measure of average fuel economy in the U.S. from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute shows an increase since 2014 in average mpg.Back in 2012, the Obama Administration set a target fuel economy rating of 54.5 by 2025.Related auto stocks: GM, F, TM, FCAU, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, OTC:HYMLF.

Signs point to a trucking 2.0 reset
The trucking industry is anxiously waiting for the release of key heavy-duty truck order releases next week as it assesses demand for 2017.Overcapacity has impacted trucking pricing this year and forced several companies to idle parts of their fleets and rethink strategy. More than half of trucking stocks with a market cap of over $50M are showing a negative YTD return.There's a sense that the extended downturn in freight demand could be bottoming out, a theory that could be confirmed by the upcoming reports from ACT Research and FTR.Looking further down the road, it can't be ignored that autonomous vehicle technology could have an impact with trucking services, logistics firms and truck makers. The dramatic delivery of 50K Budweisers (NYSE:BUD) by self-driving transport company Otto (Private:UBER) is considered by some analysts as much more than a publicity stunt.Ford (NYSE:F) announced last summer that it's developing smaller self-driving delivery trucks and Google has a USPTO-approved patent on a self-driving delivery truck.

U.S. auto sales forecast to fall 7% in October
TrueCar estimates new U.S. vehicles sales will fall 6.6% in October to 1.36M units.The forecast doesn't adjust for the two fewer selling days in the period this year. Hurricane Matthew was also a negative factor on sales during the month.Rather suddenly, one of the more common words in the automobile sector in relation to sales growth has been "plateau" or variations of the noun. "As retail demand plateaus automakers will be forced to make the critical decision to cut vehicle production or increase incentives,' notes TrueCar analyst Eric Lyman.Incentive spending is forecast to increase 16% Y/Y during October.TrueCar's sales forecasts by automaker are posted below.BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) -10.7% to 30K units, market share 2.2% vs. 2.1% last month.Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF) +0.1% to 32.5K units, market share 2.4% vs. 2.3% last month.FCA (NYSE:FCAU) -11.0% to 175K units, market share 12.9% vs. 13.5% last month.Ford (NYSE:F) -9.9% to 192K units, market share 14.1% vs. 14.2% last month.General Motors (NYSE:GM) -8.9% to 239.5K units, market share 17.6% vs. 17.4% last month.Honda (NYSE:HMC) -2.8% to 128K units, market share 9.4% vs. 9.3% last month.Hyundai (OTC:HYMLF) -7.0% to 55.8K units, market share 4.1% vs. 4.6% last month.Kia (HYUMLF) -2.1% to 49K units, market share 3.6% vs. 3.4% last month.Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) -2.6% to 113K units, market share 8.3% vs. 8.9% last month.Subaru (OTCPK:FUJHY) +0.7% to 52K units, market share 3.8% vs. 3.8% last month.Toyota (NYSE:TM) -1.5% to 201K units, market share 14.8% vs. 13.7% last month.Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY) -16.9% to 43.5K units, 3.2% vs. 3.2% last month.Research firms are likely to include Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) in their monthly forecasts in the future as the EV automaker scales up with increased production of the Model S, Model X and the Model 3 in due time.

Autonomous vehicle talk shifts the investing matrix
While Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) may have grabbed some headlines this week for its ambitious goals with autonomous driving (SAE level 5), the technology is being widely discussed across industries as a potential future reality.At a real estate conference in New York this week, a panel member called autonomous vehicles the biggest tech news concerning real estate in the last ten years. Some see a future reversal of urbanization trends in a development that could have significant investment implications.City planners and architects are already thinking of next-gen design. A paper titled "Beyond Google's Cute Car" (.pdf version) is a good example of how cities are being reimagined.Then there's this from the man who designed the 2015 Ford Mustang. "The next 10 years in this business is going to be the biggest change and challenge since the turn of the last century when cars took over for horses," said Ford design chief Moray Callum. Ford (NYSE:F) aims to have a high-volume, fully autonomous SAE level 4-capable vehicle in commercial operation in 2021.Self-driving car development is a topic of discussion on FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Lyft (Private:LYFT), Uber (Private:UBER), Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ), Google (GOOGL, GOOG), Avis Budget (NASDAQ:CAR), Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Earnings season is just heating up, but a host of companies -- including OTCPK:TMOAF, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTCPK:VOLVY, MXIM, CPRT,  WBC, GNTX  and XLNX -- have already talked up the trend on their conference calls. GM reports earnings this week and will update on any self-driving Chevy Bolt plans.Looking ahead, insurance companies, chipmakers, truckers and cybersecurity firms (NYSEARCA:HACK) will be firmly in the self-driving conversation.So who has a profitable trade idea off of the evolution of cars?

Tesla raises stakes in the self-driving car push
Shares of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) are lower in early trading after the company announced it is loading all new cars with self-driving hardware.Elon Musk told reporters last night that he envisions that by the end of 2017 a Tesla vehicle will be able to drive from Los Angeles to New York without the driver touching the wheel. He also said the software system will be built by Tesla and run off of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips.Tesla's timetable is aggressive in relation to the stated plans of some rivals. Earlier this year, Ford (NYSE:F) said it aims to bring a high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle to the ride sharing industry by 2021, while Nissan has a target of 2020 for "commercially viable" autonomous models. General Motors (NYSE:GM) already has a pre-production Bolt EV out in the wild, but hasn't set a specific timetable for a fully autonomous version.Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is the company that has posted the most information about the challenges of the self-driving car initiative. A scan of Google's monthly reports is not a bad way to catch up on the burgeoning technology.Previously: Tesla announces all vehicles to be loaded with self-driving hardware (Oct. 19)TSLA -1.74% premarket to $200.01.

Project Titan could still be a factor in the automobile sector
The focus on Apple's (AAPL -0.2%) influence in the automobile sector has shifted away from straight manufacturing to ways the tech company could integrate software, information systems, or automated driving capabilities into next-gen models.The recent developments with Project Titan also raise the stakes on which automakers strike a significant partnership with Apple if the venture makes it past 2017 (the reported AAPL deadline).While many auto industry watchers think major automakers won't convert to the Apple ecosystem across their portfolio, high-end "Applefied" models are seen as a realistic possibility."A luxury automobile with 'Apple Inside'? That could be hit, and a profitable one yet," writes Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik.SA contributor Bret Kenwell also dug into the Project Titan issue earlier this week.Related stocks: GM, FCAU, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:VLKAY, OTCPK:BMWYY, OTCPK:DDAIF, TSLA, OTCPK:MZDAY,  TSLA, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:FUJHY, RACE, TTM, MBLY.Previously: Bloomberg: Apple scales down automotive strategy, plans to build car postponed (Oct. 17) Oct. 19, 2016, 11:35 AM | 65 Comments

Ford to shut Michigan Mustang plant for a week after weak September sales
Ford (NYSE:F) says it is shutting its Mustang factory in Michigan for a week after U.S. sales for the model suffered a 32% drop last month, in a potential sign of growing weakness in the U.S. auto market.Ford idled the factory in Flat Rock, which employs 3,702 workers and makes Mustangs and Lincoln Continentals, and will resume production Oct. 17; under the automaker’s labor agreement, workers will be paid during the shutdown.Mustang was outsold last month by the Chevrolet Camaro for the first time since October 2014 on the strength of incentives that more than tripled last month to $3,409 per car, compared with an average discount of $2,602 on the Mustang, according to J.D.

Germany says nein to internal combustion engines
A development to watch in the automobile industry is the reaction to the vote last week in Germany by the Bundesrat to ban vehicles powered by gas and diesel by 2030.The non-binding resolution will place more pressure on the European Commission to promote zero-emission mobility, even with the long time frame in place.The relative ease with which the 16 German states on the council came to pass the measure could explain the very strong electrification push recently out of Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY), Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF), and BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY).Other automakers including Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Toyota (NYSE:TM) will also keep a watch on the efforts in Europe to cut out ICE models.

Ford plays defense on Mexico strategy
Ford (F -0.1%) isn't backing down from criticism levied at the company by Donald Trump over it moving small car production to Mexico.The company says there will be zero job losses as a result of the Mexico plant with new production scheduled in Michigan for the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup. SUV and truck sales have outpaced small car sales by a wide margin this year and generate higher margins for the automaker - thus allowing more leeway for union wages.Execs have also countered the claim from Trump that Ford's announcement was timed to get ahead of the election, noting the multi-billion investment was disclosed months ago before Trump was the GOP nominee.From Ford's official statement: "We’re very proud to have invested $12 billion in our U.S. plants and created 28,000 U.S. jobs over the last five years.

Ford talks numbers in Detroit while self-driving Fusions take a spin in Pittsburgh
Self-driving Ford Fusions are out in the wild in Pittsburgh as part of Uber's test run of the concept. Engadget posted a picture of the Uber self-driving fleet for those in Steel City on the watch. Ford (F -0.9%) isn't directly involved in the initiative with Uber engineers grabbing the Fusions off the lot, although autonomous technology has been a major talking point at the company's analyst day event.Execs have also been talking numbers in Detroit. Ford expects to achieve cost efficiencies averaging $3B annually between 2016 and 2018. Auto capex is seen rising to 5.6% of revenue in 2018 from a current level of 4.9% - before tailing off again. Operating margin is expected to fall this year below the 6.8% mark from a year ago. Ford says profit will fall in 2017 as the investments in mobility and EVs factor in. On U.S. sales, Ford's management continues to lean to the conservative side as compared to other industry forecasts from automakers and analysts.Previously: Ford outlines strategy an analyst day event (Sept. 14)Ford Investor Day webcast Sep. 14, 2016, 10:24 AM | 1 Comment

Elon Musk tweets that he is busy working on a blog post with more details on the "major" improvements from Tesla Motors (TSLA -0.7%) coming to Autopilot versions 8.0 and 8.1 within a few weeks.Beyond all the debate on Tesla or Musk's timing, the updates to the Autopilot software are seen as very important to the industry as automakers work their way around the software/sensor/AI challenges with developing autonomous technologies.Last week, Ford (F -0.2%) announced that it acquired Israel-based SAIPS to help it with AI and advanced algorithms in its self-driving push.

U.S. auto sales expected to tail off in August
U.S. auto sales are expected to show a decline of 2% to 5% for August amid a dialing back of discounting activity, according to the range of forecasts from Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, J.D. Power, and LMC Automotive. General Motors  is poised to report a loss of market share as its plan to cut out fleet sales impacts volume.Bloomberg estimates the seasonally adjusted selling rate for the month will be 17.2M, down from 17.9M last month.The sales dip isn't necessarily a bottom line drag for the sector due to reduced discounting and the increasing mix of higher-profit SUVs and trucks. But higher profit hasn't lifted automaker stocks this year, with the group having trouble gaining traction and trading with low forward PE multiples (GM 5.5, Ford 6.8, Honda 10.5, Toyota 10.9).Auto parts stocks (LEA, TEN, BWA, DAN, MPAA, CPS, DLPH, AXL, TOWR, ACW, FENX, MTOR, THRM, SMP, ALV, MOD, SRI) will be on watch tomorrow when the reports roll in as the sector frequently sees some extra volatility on days U.S. auto sales are disclosed.Related stocks: GM, FCAU, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:VLKAY, OTCPK:BMWYY, OTCPK:DDAIF, TSLA, OTCPK:MZDAY,  TSLA, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:FUJHY, RACE.

Traffic fatalities in the U.S. jumped 7.2% to 35,092 last year to break away from a long trend of declining auto deaths.Close to half of the deaths involved passengers not wearing seat belts, while almost one in three fatalities involved drunk drivers or speeding.The increased rate of traffic deaths was more than twice the 3.5% rise in road miles traveled last year amid lower gas prices.The issue of traffic deaths has been raised in the automobile industry by companies talking up their self-driving car initiatives, although it's unclear this early on what the impact on fatality rates will be from autonomous driving.Related stocks: TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, F, GM, FCAU.Previously: Ford to produce mass market autonomous vehicle (Aug. 16)Previously: Uber acquires Otto as self-driving push intensifies (Aug. 18)Previously: Mobileye and Delphi Automotive confirm self-driving partnership (Aug. 23) Aug. 29, 2016, 3:08 PM | 60 Comments

Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY) plans to unveil an electric vehicle at the Paris Motor Show which will get 300 miles of driving range off a single 15-minute charge.Though the selling specification might only be limited to available charging infrastructure with the required voltage, it's still a significant marketing point from the world's largest automaker.Reports indicate the Golf model-sized EV will arrive in late 2018 or early 2019.Earlier this summer as part of its Diesel scandal reset, Volkswagen announced a target to have 30 new EV models by 2025.More than 24 new EV models are due to showcased at the Paris Motor Show in October at last check, including highly-anticipated looks at new EV models from Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF) and the European version of the Chevy Bolt (NYSE:GM) with the Ampera-E debut.All the EV buzz is sure to factor in to how investors gauge long-term demand for Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) with the Model S, Model X, Model 3, and beyond.An interesting side note is that Ford (NYSE:F) is skipping the Paris event. The Detroit player's launch schedule didn't justify the cost and its long-term autonomous vehicle strategy is just now being mapped out.

World's first self-driving taxi service launches
Singapore became the first country in the world to offer a self-driving taxi service with the targeted launch of nuTonomy. A full roll-out of an autonomous taxi service across the nation is expected as early as 2018.While self-driving cars from Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and others have been out testing on the roads for the last few years, nuTonomy's service is the first commercial application of the nascent technology open to public use. Uber (Private:UBER) plans to test self-driving cars in Pittsburgh next month.NuTonomy will use human drivers as backups in the initial roll-out of the Renault (OTC:RNSDF, OTCPK:RNLSY) Zoe and Mitusubishi (OTCPK:MMTOF) i-MiEV taxis before moving to full autonomy.Other companies with autonomous vehicles on their radar include Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH), Volvo (OTCPK:GELYF), Ford (NYSE:F), Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), Toyota (NYSE:TM), Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ), Avis Budget (NASDAQ:CAR), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), BMW (BAMXY), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Honda (NYSE:HMC), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Lyft (Private:LYFT), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) to name just a partial list -- although analyzing which stocks may benefit from a future of a mix of self-driving cars on the road is a tricky business.Previously: Scientists warn on self-driving car rush (July 8)Previously: Self-driving car push adds a little buzz for restaurants (Aug. 6) Aug. 25, 2016, 8:28 AM | 107 Comments

All eyes on Ford with autonomous announcement on tap
Ford (NYSE:F) says it will make an announcement at 2:00 p.m. EDT to discuss the company's expanding presence in Silicon Valley and autonomous vehicle development.The automaker will also host a conference call with analysts at 4:00 p.m. to discuss its smart mobility ambitions. The roster of Ford execs on the call include global development and technology heavyweights.Earlier today on CNBC, CEO Mark Fields joined the group of leaders predicting a seismic change in the automobile industry."Our view is autonomous vehicles could have just as much [of an] impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," Fields noted. In an important revelation, Fields says more customers are telling the company that they are interested in the autonomous driving option -- an anecdote that  runs counter to the view of some that drivers don't want to give up the wheel (partially or fully).Field hinted that the scheduled autonomous announcement for today will be significant. It's a development that could have some bearing on the self-driving plans of General Motors (NYSE:GM), Audi (OTCPK:VLKAY), Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), and Toyota (NYSE:TM).

China auto sales strong as Beijing considers major EV proposal
Automobile deliveries in China soared 26% Y/Y to 1.6M units in July, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The pace of sales was the highest in over 40 months, although it came against a weak comparable from a year ago.Car deliveries in China are up 11% since the government lowered the tax on small vehicles to 5%.Demand for SUVs and crossovers remained strong, with deliveries up 47% to over 580K. Domestic automakers posted strong growth during the month, led by Guangzho Automobile (+37%), Geely Automobile Holdings (+72%), and Great Wall Motors (+49%).EV watch: A new proposal in China aims to boost EV sales by forcing automakers to produce more electric cars or purchase carbon credit offsets from peers. If Beijing grants final approval, the new rules will replace direct subsidies that are set to expire by 2020. On the production front, LeEco announced plans this week for a $1.8B plant in China capable of producing 400K electric vehicles a year. The online video giant is also a backer of Faraday Futures, the somewhat mysterious EV startup out of California.

Automobile stocks stalled in political year drama
There's almost no chance that the automobile industry won't be a major talking point during the U.S. presidential election campaign which adds a layer of uncertainty for investors in the sector.While the ramifications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Donald Trump's plan to add tariffs on foreign car makers and auto parts suppliers are already being debated, it's the union workers who may be the target of the most discussion in the next few months with Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania considered critical battleground stocks.The United Auto Workers endorsed Hillary Clinton and expects her to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to help land stronger unions in Mexico, while Trump has taken a more populist route of promising to add tariffs on Ford for cars built in Mexico. He's also hammering home that he will force better trade deals, but is walking a tightrope with some Rust Belt voters after suggesting that local plants should be closed and moved to states with lower wages.Most analysts think it's more likely that the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit will expire if Trump wins the election than if Clinton ascends to the White House. The EPA and some its regulations are also sure to get a hard look.Investors are looking for a breakout after the dust settles, with the Detroit Three all trailing the S&P 500 Index return for the year.Related stocks: GM, FCAU, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:VLKAY, OTCPK:BMWYY, OTCPK:DDAIF, TSLA, OTCPK:MZDAY,  TSLA, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:FUJHY.

U.S. government to invest up to $4.5B on electric car changing stations
The Obama administration will invest as much as $4.5B to build electric car charging stations, aiming to complete a U.S. network by 2020 to make “coast-to-coast, nationwide zero-emissions travel” a reality.The government plan will release Energy Department loan guarantees to support a commercial scale roll-out of charging stations, with federal, state and local governments partnering with automakers such as Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANF, OTCPK:NSANY) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Charging infrastructure has been a major obstacle to widespread adoption of electric cars, but Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer tells Bloomberg that longer battery ranges probably would do the most toward boosting electric car numbers.

Scientists warn on self-driving car rush
A thoughtful piece in Scientific American take a look at the technological challenges in delivering automated driving services.An electrical engineer at Carnegie-Mellon notes that the vision systems of today's automated test cars are imperfect by a "very good" margin. A mobility expert at the University of California concurs, while adding that drivers may be overestimating their car's automated capabilities due to the use of terms such as "autopilot" and "self-driving." A refined system of cameras, sensors, and radar is still believed by some engineers to be a few years off.Alphabet's (GOOG, [[GOOGL]) top exec in charge of the company's self-driving initiative seemed to back the view of the scientists in his recent testimony to Congress. "We saw in our own testing that the human drivers can’t always be trusted to dip in and out of the task of driving when the car is encouraging them to sit back and relax," he stated.Related stocks: OTCPK:BAMXY, GM, OTCPK:DDAIF, MBLY, FCAU, TSLA, F, OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC.

The state of infamy continues in the automobile sector
It's another shocking breach of trust in the automobile sector after PSA Group (OTCPK:PEUGF, OTC:PUGOF, OTC:PUGOF) confirms that advertised fuel economy ratings on Peugeot and Citroen models don't match up with reality (off by 44% on average). Bloomberg reports that it's the first time a major automaker has confirmed a discrepancy between lab results and actual road tests across a broad range of cars.Official PSA lab resultsRecent failures in the automobile industry include inflated mileage claims from the South Korean automakers, the Takata disaster which deeply impacted Japanese cars, GM's costly ignition switch recall, and the topper in terms of subterfuge - Volkswagen's emissions cheating saga.Some automobile industry analysts have suggested that buyers are scandal-weary and are unlikely to factor in the reputation hits in their buying decisions.Related stocks: GM, FCAU, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:VLKAY, OTCPK:BAMXY, OTCPK:DDAIF, TSLA, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTCPK:SZKMY, TSLA, OTCPK:MMTOF, OTC:HYMLF.

Data dive suggests rising auto demand from millennials
An analysis of data from LendingTree suggests that millennials want to drive and own cars."The share of millennial auto loan requests has climbed from roughly 27 percent in early 2013 to about 34 percent in 2016, suggesting a return of younger buyers to the car market," concludes Lending Tree after diving into loan requests.On a volume basis, the most popular cars that millennials requested a loan for were the Nissan Altima, Dodge Charger, Honda Accord, Chevrolet Impala, and Chevrolet Tahoe. Millennials opted for used vehicles at a slightly higher clip than older drivers, 46% vs. 44%.The crush of major automaker-tech firm partnerships (Toyota-Uber, GM-Lyft, Fiat-Google, Volkswagen-Gett) popping up is predicated in part on a younger generation attuned to ride-sharing and ride-hailing. There's also been an assumption by some analysts of a topping out of U.S. auto demand this year or next due in part to millennial disinterest.Related automaker/auto retailer stocks: PAG, ABG, LAD, GPI, SAH, KMX, AN, RUSHA, OTCPK:DDAIF, TM, HMC, TSLA, TTM, OTCPK:VLKAY, GM, F, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:BAMXY, OTCPK:FUJHF.

Ford eyes the EV scene
There's some buzz out of Detroit that Ford (F -2.1%) is working on an electric vehicle to compete on a mass-market basis with the Tesla Model 3 and Chevrolet Bolt.The talk appears to be some liberal extrapolation from what CEO Mark Field said during this week's earnings conference call. The Detroit News even goes as far as to speculate Ford will cash in on its Model E trademark.When the Ford boss was asked if the automaker planned to build a 200-mile range EV, he responded that some development was ongoing, although he offered no specific timetable to match up with the plans of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).Ford's position in the EV market is significant as major automakers and tech companies start to partner up.

All eyes in the automobile sector turn to Beijing
Automobile industry heavyweights are gathered in Beijing ahead of next week's major auto show. Many of the side interviews with exec are as revealing as the model reveals.Ford (NYSE:F) CEO Mark Fields is on the scene. He has already tipped to reporters that the automaker isn't interested in a merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU). Last week, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne teed up Toyota (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY), and the Blue Oval as the only remaining potential merger partners left in the industry.This year's event takes on added significance with local manufacturers increasing market share in China. During Q1, the top five selling models in the high-margin SUV category were all made by Chinese companies.Automobile sales are expected to rise 7% in China this year, aided by a tax break on purchases. Some analysts think that demand will fall flat next year.Another key topic will be the supply chain disruption due to the earthquakes in Japan. Most of the majors have been affected by the natural disaster.Models being showcased next week at the Beijing Auto Show include the Acura CDX, Audi TT RS, Chevrolet FV2030, Jaguar XFL, and the all-electric LeEco.The LeEco is made by the Chinese parent company of EV player Faraday Futures.

Ford & GM have at least 25% upside - Barron's
Sales at Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM) are booming, but you wouldn't know it from their share prices, Barron's says in a bullish cover piece this weekend.Key concerns include a drop from Q1's torrid sales pace (both slid when March sales came in at a mere 16.56M (annualized)); weaker China growth; rising buyer incentives; and subprime loans.But investors fail to appreciate the degree to which the two have achieved efficiencies since the last cycle. "That means it can sustain profitability - and show good profitability - late in the sales cycle,"  Annie Rosen, manager of the Fidelity Select Automotive Portfolio, says.Ford trades for 6.6x 2016 earnings and 3.9x projected cash flow; GM fetches 5.6x and 3.4x.Barron's thinks shares have 25% upside in the coming year, not including dividends of 4.9% for GM and 4.6% for Ford.Now read Are Hydrogen Cars A Threat To The Electric Vehicle? » Apr. 17, 2016, 7:29 AM | 64 Comments

March U.S. auto sales rose 3% Y/Y but a disappointing adjusted annual rate of 16.57M vehicles came in well below analyst expectations and the 17.5M clip the industry enjoyed in February.Ford (NYSE:F), GM and Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) each reported sales gains but their results missed expectations, sending shares lower (I, II, III).The sales report “plays into the idea that with 2015 being a record year, maybe we’re set up to start peaking a little bit in terms of consumer demand," Bloomberg's Kevin Tynan says.However, historically-low gasoline prices and interest rates continue to lure consumers to dealer showrooms, setting the stage for car sales this year to remain near 2015’s record 17.5M, says Barclays analyst Brian Johnson, who adds that some automakers will need to “cough up incentives to keep it there."Now read U.S. auto sales forecast to increase 8% in March Apr. 1, 2016, 6:25 PM | 67 Comments

Ford CEO: "We can't compete with central banks"
Choice quotes from Henry Blodget's interview of Ford (NYSE:F) CEO Mark Fields, one year after having taken over:"There was a lot of talk a little earlier this year about recession, and when we look at those metrics, they're giving us a different story. Plus, if you look back over the years, there's never been a recession in the U.S. without having an increase in unemployment, and you're not seeing that."For us the main policy is making sure that currency is not used as a weapon, if you will, to manipulate the cost of products, whether they're imported or exported. We can compete with anybody around the world. We can't compete with central banks."We are transitioning from an auto company to an auto and a mobility company. Mobility for us, at the very simplest level, is to allow people to live, play, and work where they want. How do we help enable them to get around to do that? And there's a lot of talk around technology companies disrupting the auto industry.

Jump in auto leasing could pressure prices down the road
The percentage of BMW (OTCPK:BAMXY) vehicles either leased or financed went to 46.3% in 2015 from a level of 41.8% just a year prior, observes Bloomberg Gadfly. A massive jump for a short time period.Though the company isn't suffering from some of the delinquency issues that are picking up in the automobile industry (see subprime concerns for lenders, auto retailers, and Detroit majors), there could be implications down the road as a glut of vehicles come off their leases.Across the industry, vehicle leasing as a percentage of sales rose to 32.3% in February vs. the average of 28% in 2015.

Credit Suisse downgrades Ford (NYSE:F) to Underperform from Neutral. The investment firm assigns a price target of $13 to the blue oval."We believe North American EBIT guidance is at risk on overly optimistic implied volumes and global inventories that have fallen meaningfully out of step with demand, while recent pricing/mix gains from new product launches in NA have been fully offset by material cost increases," reads the analyst note.The take from CS could underestimate the cost savings and momentum in the U.S. for Ford seen by many other industry watchers (see the long case on Ford from SA contributors).F -3.0% premarket to $12.05.

Barron's: GM looks like a relative bargain vs. Ford
In addition to raising its full-year guidance, quarterly dividend and share repurchase plan, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is significantly cheaper than rival Ford (NYSE:F) at 5.6x forward earnings even as its projected long-term growth rate of 23% is much higher, Barron's says.Concern that automakers will need to sacrifice pricing power to entice buyers and reduce inventory may not be felt as keenly by GM, whose 1.9% drop in U.S. sales last month was better than it looks, according to J.P. Morgan’s Ryan Brinkman, as "vehicles transacted at an unprecedented $37K average transaction price in December, up $1,150 Y/Y."GM CEO Mary Barra has effectively navigated the huge recall of more than 30M vehicles for faulty ignition switches as well as rapid technological changes in the industry, Barron's also says.Credit Suisse, which upgraded GM to Outperform on Monday, sees “a management team coming into its own in terms of driving efficiencies across the organization as well as positioning the company to win in a global auto market that is likely to change massively over the next 5-10 years."

The Detroit Three star in Vegas, slump in New York
Major automakers are stealing the show this week at CES in Las Vegas off of some dreamy futuristic innovations, but are slumping in New York trading on some grounded reality. Detroit automakers Fiat Chrysler (FCAU -6%), Ford (F -3.4%), and General Motors (GM -2.8%) are all notably lower.U.S. auto sales increased 9% Y/Y in December, but were boosted by some extra discounting. Still, the higher mix of SUVs and premium trucks could help to make up for the year-end inventory clearing, note some insiders. Even accounting for discounting, pricing trends improved in December compared to a year ago, reports Kelley Blue Book.Looking ahead, the strong appeal of crossovers with millennials is seen as underpinning demand into 2016.There's been skittish trading across automobile related sectors. Earlier today, AutoNation rattled the auto retailer group with a warning, while auto parts stocks are down sharply once again - led by Federal-Mogul (FDML -5.8%), Stoneridge (SRI -5%), and Lear (LEA -4%).

U.S. auto sales set record in 2015 but face slower growth this year
U.S. automobile sales totaled a record 17.47M in 2015, up 5.7% Y/Y, even as December sales trailed economist expectations, according to figures from automotive research firm Autodata.Analysts and execs foresee another record in 2016 but at a slower rate of growth, and provided that the automakers continue to serve a heavy helping of discounts.The effects of discounts were felt in December, as industry sales set a record for the month even while falling short of predictions, in part because automakers kept their incentives even with November after starting early with year-end dealmaking; as a result, most auto stocks fell in today's trade - including GM -2.6% and Ford (NYSE:F) -1.8% (I, II) - except for Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), whose sales led the group with a 19% Y/Y gain.Slowing growth and rising incentives may add pressure on profits industry-wide, according to auto analyst Jeff Schuster, who says 2015 "will be the year that will really test the discipline of the manufacturers."

EV industry set to star at CES
The electric vehicle industry could grow up all at once next month at the CES Show in Las Vegas with major automakers set to plant their flags.General Motors (NYSE:GM) will unveil the production version of its all-electric Chevrolet Bolt and will confirm whether or not a 200-mile range and the $30K sticker price are realistic goals.Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) will showcase the Leaf EV and Toyota (NYSE:TM) plans to highlight its juiced-up Prius hybrid.A huge talking point will be Ford's (NYSE:F) presentation when Mark Fields will talk strategy. The billion-dollar question is if Field will formally announce a self-driving car partnership between Ford and Google. That collaboration could influence EV demand across the board.Perhaps the most interesting EV reveal at CES will be when Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY) exec Dr. Herbert Diess uses a keynote address to discuss the German automaker's electric car initiative. Diess will leave the diesel emissions scandal in the rear-view mirror to unveil Volkswagen's EV concept car. Autocar reports that an electric Microbus will be unveiled.Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) won't be a major player at CES, although the company's long-term track could be impacted by some of the revelations of its peers.

Report: Google, Ford forming self-driving car JV
Yahoo Autos reports Google/Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Ford (NYSE:F) are creating a JV that will build self-driving cars using Google's technology. The companies reportedly plan to announce their effort at CES (runs from Jan. 6-9).The JV, which limits Ford's legal liability, is said to be non-exclusive. Google has also been talking with other automakers, as it pushes forward with a goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020. The company has suggested it doesn't want to be an auto manufacturer itself, but rather a hardware/software supplier to third-party automakers.The report comes a week after one from Bloomberg stating Google plans to make its self-driving car unit a separate Alphabet company. In September, Google hired ex-Hyundai America chief John Krafcik to lead its self-driving efforts.Google has a head-start in both creating advanced self-driving systems/prototypes and collecting real-world driving data - it has logged 1.3M miles to date - but is far from alone in going after the market. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Volvo, and Tesla are among the existing automakers to have invested in autonomous driving R&D. Baidu, Samsung, and Uber are also interested, and Apple reportedly so.Last week: Ford wins permit for public testing of self-driving cars Dec. 22, 2015, 12:20 AM | 44 Comments
California takes first crack at self-driving car rules
Proposed rules in California would require drivers in the state to apply for a special driver's license before being allowed to use an autonomous car.The self-driving car would also go through an independent test before being set free on the road.Self-driving cars will only be available for lease if the proposed regulations are approved.Controversial issues with where insurance liability will fall are still being hashed out.Most automakers are dabbling with self-driving cars or autonomous features, while Alphabet has the most advanced program. However, by the looks of it the Alphabet concept vehicle could have trouble with the California DMV standards.Previously: Ford wins permit for public testing of self-driving cars (Dec. 15 2015)Related stocks: GM, F, FCAU, TSLA, HMC, TM, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:BAMXY, OTCPK:DDAIF.

Corning lands automotive windshield design win for Gorilla Glass
The latest version of the Ford GT supercar will be the first production vehicle to have a windshield that contains Corning's (NYSE:GLW) Gorilla Glass. The GT also uses Gorilla Glass for two other applications.Corning and Ford (NYSE:F) state the use of Gorilla Glass lowers the car's weight by more than 12 pounds. Pound-for-pound, Corning claims Gorilla Glass has over 5x the strength of standard window glass.With Ford pricing the GT at $400K and aiming to sell ~250 units/year, the design win is far from a high-volume one. However, it serves as a useful reference win for Corning, which has been pitching automakers for years on Gorilla Glass' ability (for a price) to make cars lighter, more fuel-efficient, more aerodynamic (lower center of gravity), and quieter inside.

J.P. Morgan: U.S. automakers ending year with a bang
J.P. Morgan sees a strong end to the year for automakers Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), with a particularly strong November in the U.S. ahead as well as China sales beating expectations.The firm's Ryan Brinkman sees U.S. light vehicle SAAR heading up to 18.5M in November from October's 18.1M (which itself was up 10% Y/Y) -- meaning that not only would November purchases beat all other November figures, they would be the most of any other month in the current cycle.While incentives are down Q/Q, they're up about $100 Y/Y but resulting in average transaction prices up more than $1,000 from a year ago.“Some automakers we spoke to were surprised at the rate of improvement in recent months, pointing to unexpectedly strong consumer reaction to only modestly higher incentives, which has lowered inventories (a recipe for strong profitability),” Brinkman wrote.Previously: U.S. auto sales expected to set a record in November (Nov. 24 2015) Nov. 27, 2015, 12:36 PM | 48 Comments
The retail sector heads into Black Friday with a $2 gas tailwind
The average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. has now dropped to $2.06 per gallon - a mark that is 27% lower than where gas prices stood heading into the holiday period last year. Despite the extra dollars in the wallets of consumers, most forecasts for holiday retail sales are on the modest side (below 4%).The extended period of sub-$3 gas prices in the U.S. hasn't exactly lit consumer spending across broad retail on fire (just ask Wal-Mart) - although it has stoked auto sales for the Detroit Three (GM, F, FCAU). The regional casino sector (ISLE, PENN, BYD, ERI, MTN, MCRI) and cruise line stocks (NCLH, RCL) have also benefited more than major chain stores. Some have suggested that lower gas prices are also an understated driver for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which both score high on customer stickiness.What next? Seeking Alpha's Stock Pitch Contest on retail is still open until November 30 amid the reset on consumer spending expectations. Current long ideas include PLAY, FRAN, CASY, SKX, WMT, PSUN, HGG, PRTY, TJX, TA, VSTO - while short bets on WMAR, TIF, RT, AMZN, UA, LB, and OUTR are on record.Related ETFs: XLP, XLY, VDC, XRT, VCR, RTH, RETL, FXG, PBJ, IYK, IYC, FXD, PEJ, FDIS, RHS, FSTA, SCC, UCC, RCD, PMR, PEZ, UGE, PSL, PSCC, PSCD, SZK, BITE.

Smashing month for U.S. auto sales as broad retail sits and watches
U.S. auto sales soared in October with the Detroit Three (F, GM, FCAU) all showing double-digit gains from a year ago.

Japanese automakers performed strong, while German brands performed better than expected after some spillover from the Volkswagen cheating scandal was anticipated.If there's a catch, it might be what the crowding out impact is on broad retail as consumers take on larger auto payments.

Disruption in the auto industry from east to west
The European Automobile Manufacturers Association issued a statement this week in which it forecasts that a "substantial number" of diesel models will have to be phased out earlier than anticipated.The harsh assessment was mirrored by several heavyweight CEOs at the Tokyo Motor Show. The major focus of the event has been next-gen concepts like hydrogen-powered cars and self-driving features, while execs such as Nissan's Carlos Ghosn have marginalized the future of diesel.Many automobile industry insiders have noted that diesel was in decline due to the focus on emissions even before Volkswagen (OTCQX:VLKAY) rocked the industry with a cheating scandal.The mix of technology, EV, hydrogen, and powertrain changes have kept analysts buzzing over the proper valuations to assign to major players. A reset of demand expectations in China also factors in significantly.Automobile industry stocks: DAN, BWA, MTOR, TRW, FDML, DLPH,GNTX, SMP, AXL, MPAA, ALV, MOD, DLPH, VC, THRM, WPRT, GM, F, TM, FCAU, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, TSLA, OTCQX:VLKAY, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:BAMXY, TTM, TSLA, THRM, BWA, JCI, TEN, CPS, LDL, TOWR, OTCPK:PEUGF, OTC:RNSDF, OTCPK:RNLSY.Previously: Hydrogen and self-driving cars the talk at the Toyota Motor Show (Oct. 29) Oct. 31, 2015, 12:51 PM | 290 Comments

Aluminum bet starts to pay off for Ford
The gigantic bet by Ford (NYSE:F) on using aluminum in the popular F-150 line is starting to pay off as production wrinkles smooth out and consumers show confidence in the truck's reliability.The gap between Ford F-150 sales and Chevrolet Silverado sales has widened in recent months as positive reviews on performance continue to pour in.F-150 sales in September improved 16.4% Y/Y to 69,651 units. Perhaps more important than the raw volume number, the average F-10 sticker price was up $6.1K from a year ago.What's next: An aluminum-bodied Ford Expedition was spotted near the Ford development center in Dearborn, Michigan.Bottom line: Ford is up 11.8% over the last 52 weeks. Some auto industry analysts think that concerns on the F-150 roll-out have been a drag on share price. Oct. 24, 2015, 10:23 AM | 56 Comments

Fiat labor agreement not necessarily a template
The proposed labor contract between the United Auto Workers union and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) isn't necessarily the same wage deal that will be pressed upon other Detroit automakers, UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles told Ford (NYSE:F) workers.For several years, contract deals struck by Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler have largely mirrored one another, but the union's longtime commitment to pattern bargaining seems to be weakening based on the diverging finances of the carmakers.Previously: UAW workers to vote on Fiat Chrysler deal (Oct. 09 2015) Oct. 13, 2015, 2:26 AM | 12 Comments

J.P. Morgan lists 25 non-financial stocks at risk if Fed raises rates
J.P. Morgan analysts warn that companies with large amounts of floating-rate debt - including Chesapeake Energy, Freeport McMoRan, Ford and GE - could be at risk if the Fed decides to raise interest rates.Companies with variable/floating-rate debt suffer a more immediate impact by a rate hike than companies with fixed-rate debt, the analysts say; variable-rate coupons typically reset quarterly, meaning that changes in the base rate flow through almost immediately to variable-rate borrowers, while fixed-rate borrowers do not see such an impact until they refinance or issue new debt.JPM lists 25 companies - not including financials - that have the “highest variable-rate debt as a percentage of market cap": FMC, NRG, FCX, AES, CVC, LVLT, PVH, CHK, FE, DVA, THC, OI, CNX, F, HCA, FOSL, RCL, JOY, GE, ADS, ALLE, HBI, GT, DNB, AN

Ford to use next-gen aluminum in F-150, sets joint development with Alcoa
Ford (NYSE:F) will start using an advanced Alcoa (NYSE:AA) aluminum alloy for several parts of its top-selling F-150 pickup, and the companies will collaborate on using the next-gen "Micromill" process aluminum in other vehicles through a joint development agreement.The alloy -- tough enough to replace steel but much lighter -- has been a key target for automakers seeking to meet tougher fuel standards while meeting safety standards. The material will be targeted for inside door panels and fenders.Ford launched its 2015 F-150 with an aluminum alloy body that was 700 pounds lighter than before; the 2016 model will use the first components using the new alloy.Micromill produces alloy 30% stronger than regular aluminum, 40% more formable, and goes from molten to cooled and coiled in 20 minutes, vs. 20 days for rolling conventional aluminum.

Goldman rate-hike plays: Favor balance sheet quality, avoid floating rate debt
With market eyes on a Fed rate-hike decision considered to be a bit of a toss-up amid differing opinions, Goldman Sachs is banking on the (slightly) more dovish position that the agency will wait until December. The bank is still laying out how to play the hike when it invariably comes.Strength in balance sheets is what you need, it says, noting that those companies outperform (by an average 5%) in the three months after a rate-boosting cycle begins. In Goldman's "High Quality Stock" basket: CMG, DLTR, PEP, KMI, BLK, GOOG, AAPL, PCLN, ORCL, WFC.Meanwhile, it suggests avoiding companies with high floating-rate debt as they bear the brunt of a move away from near-zero interest rate policy. "When the tightening cycle finally starts, the immediate impact will be felt by firms with high proportions of variable rate borrowing."Included in that "avoid" list: CL, COL, JNJ, AAPL, EBAY, MET, KO, GIS, F, MCD, GM, TWX, CVX, AGN, MON.(Yes, cash-rich Apple made both lists, having a strong balance sheet along with floating debt.)

Loews' Joe Rosenberg sees bottom in energy and other areas of value
A self-proclaimed "kid in a candy store" in 2011, Lowes (NYSE:L) CIO Joe Rosenberg isn't as excited now as he was then, but he remains a long-term bull and sees a few particular pockets of value.Source: Barron's On oil, either OPEC and non-OPEC countries reach an agreement to cut production and the price spikes upward, or there isn't an agreement and the price collapses - wiping out a lot of production. Either way, the price moves higher, says Rosenberg, and energy stocks (XLE, OIH) have likely bottomed.Rosenberg doesn't think the dividend gets cut at Chevron (NYSE:CVX), noting board members like John Stumpf were buyers of the stock at much higher levels. "The probability of them then agreeing to a dividend cut seems somewhat remote." A similar case can be made for Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) or ExxonMobile (NYSE:XOM).Catalysts for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) include a breakup into three companies, and better capital allocation - notably, getting far more aggressive with share repurchases. "JNJ could raise $50B in the bond market in a heartbeat and use that money to buy back stock." Don't rule out an activist investor if management doesn't get with it.Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are "incredibly cheap," says Rosenberg. The strong sales pace is sustainable because the average age of cars on the road in the U.S. is about 11 years - they need to be replaced. "The stocks are discounting a very bearish scenario."

Domestic automakers take market share in China amid overall slump
Automobile sales in China fell 3% to 1.7M in August, according to an official tally from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Tighter restrictions on pollution and the impact of a cooler China economy remain significant factors.The decline is an improvement over the 7.1% slide in July, but puts YTD sales growth flat compared to last year. A top official with CAAM warns negative sales growth for the full year is possible.Strong sales of SUVs in the nation couldn't offset weak demand for sedans during the month.Domestic brands took sales from global sellers in August, improving their market share by 50 bps to 39.4%. Japanese automakers have also gained ground over the last several months. The development hits German automakers and the Detroit Three particularly hard due to their investments in China.Some analysts think sales could be tepid until the Chinese New Year next February when demand is traditionally stoked.Related automaker stocks: OTC:CQCAF, OTCPK:GWLLF, OTCPK:GWLLY, OTCPK:GELYF, OTCPK:GELYY, OTCPK:BYDDY, OTCPK:BYDDF, OTCPK:DNFGY, OTCPK:DNFGF, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTCQX:VLKAY, OTCPK:BAMXY, GM, F, OTCPK:NSANY, HMC, TM, TSLA, FCAU.

Automakers plot strategy around mass-market EV concept
The timetable by Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) to introduce its mass-market Model 3 in two years appears to give the Chevrolet Bolt EV a head start with EV buyers in the $30K-$35K range.Though development on the Bolt has been quieter than the news coming out of Fremont, Reno, and Elon Musk's twitter account - GM is reported to have hand-built protypes up and running and sales to consumers planned for 2017. Early review for the Bolt could be important with Tesla having a solid track record of dazzling reviewers with performance on the EV high-end.Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) is also player in the mass-market EV market with a new long-range Leaf in the works.Ford (NYSE:F) has denied reports it's working on a long-range EV.

Detroit gets a blast of Trump talk
Automobile industry labor issues have been teed up as a political topic with most 2016 Presidential candidates delicately walking a tightrope over the issue.The UAW is in the process of negotiating critical new contracts with Detroit automakers which involves tough talk on both sides as well as the Big Three (F, GM, FCAU) using the leverage of potentially moving more production to Mexico or Canada.One candidate making a lot of noise about automakers is Donald Trump. The GOP front-runner in the polls believes opening up more U.S. states for auto manufacturing would lead to lower wages across the board and take Mexico out of the equation. It's a position the UAW will challenge vociferously, and as pointed out in the Detroit Free Press, may backfire in the long run.Trump also promises a tougher stance on Japanese automakers (OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTCPK:MMTOF) - a populist stance that some other GOP candidates will be hesitant to match due to trade implications.Analysts think the spotlight on wages this summer could hurt negotiations for automakers.

Ford (F -1.6%) is offering incentives at a significant level on the deluxe version of its 2015 F-150 in some regional markets, according to industry watchers.Overall F-150 sales have lagged some forecasts this year as production has ramped up slower than expected.Kelley Blue Book's Akshay Anand calls the development a possible "hint" that the F-150 faces demand issues.

Just ask the cable companies.They don't take their marching orders from Madison Avenue on what products are on-trend. Just ask Abercrombie & Fitch.Millennials are likely to have a lot to say with the critical question on if electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells (Tesla vs. Toyota) emerge as the dominant alternative energy source for the industry.Automaker stocks: GM, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, TSLA, OTCQX:VLKAY, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:BAMXY, OTCPK:MMTOF, TTM, OTCPK:MMTOF, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTCPK:GELYF, FCAU.

Cheaper oil good for Ford and GM, but not for Tesla
Consumer spending in several areas is likely to benefit from lower pump prices, but J.P. Morgan's Ryan Brinkman thinks the auto industry may benefit more than most from consumers having more money to spend on all things apart from fuel.The analyst sees Goodyear Tire (NASDAQ:GT), American Axle (NYSE:AXL), GM and Ford (NYSE:F) - in that order - as best positioned to benefit, followed by suppliers with material exposure to full-size trucks and SUVs that is not as great as AXL, including Tenneco (NYSE:TEN), Lear (NYSE:LEA) and Tower International (NYSE:TOWR).Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an exception, however, as Brinkman sees a potential reduction in the terminal value of cash flows on his reduced outlook for Model 3 vehicles if fuel prices remain low longer-term.

Google and automakers advance uneasy partnership
The age of connected cars appears closer with Google pushing forward with its next-gen Android M software designed to be integrated into automobiles.The industry has a bit of an uneasy relationship with Google, despite the company's  open-source approach to the technology.Though most major automakers collaborate with Google through the Open Automotive Alliance - which aims for a common platform to drive innovation - the self-driving car initiative of Google and their own infotainment ambitions keep them wary.Analysts originally forecast vehicle-to-vehicle communication would be part of the connected car concept and be integrated into some models by 2016, although that timetable now appears unlikely.What to watch: Before any major breakthrough occurs, the DOT needs to weigh in on next-gen connected cars. That gets trickier with safety and security concerns teed up again after the high-profile GM recall debacle and crippling Sony hacking incident.Automaker stocks: GM, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, TSLA, OTCQX:VLKAY, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:BAMXY, OTCPK:MMTOF, OTCPK:PEUGF, OTC:RNSDF, TTM, OTCPK:MMTOF, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTC:RNSDF, OTCPK:GELYF, FCAU.

Modest pace to fuel economy improvement in the U.S.
The EPA says the fuel economy of 2013 models sold in the U.S. averaged 24.1 mpg, up half a mpg from the prior year's model.The modest 2.1% improvement is below the pace called for by some environmental groups and just a fraction of what would be needed to keep pace with the government's target for a 54.5 average mpg for the 2016 model year.A higher mix of SUV and truck sales offset technology gains by automakers.Related stocks: GM, F, TM, OTCPK:FIATY, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, TSLA, OTCQX:VLKAY, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:BAMXY, OTC:KIMTF, OTCPK:MMTOF,  TTM, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, HMC, FCA.

GM falls to 52-week lows after Morgan Stanley sees similar risks as Ford
General Motors (NYSE:GM) shares sank 5.8% today to a new 52-week low after Morgan Stanley said GM's overseas risks are the same as those taking a big bite out of Ford's (NYSE:F) earnings.“Ford’s reduced outlook was based on increased macro pressure in Russia, Latin America and FX and quality-related issues,” Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas wrote in cutting his price target for GM shares to $27 from $29, adding that “GM’s exposure to each of these factors is at least as great as Ford’s."GM has targeted a North American EBIT margin of 9%-10% by 2016, but Jonas forecasts only 7.2% in 2016 and 5.8% in 2017; while "a 10% margin is technically possible," Jonas wrote, "when we consider the full balance of risks and opportunities facing [North America's] light vehicle industry in terms of volume growth, mix, content and pricing, we believe a margin of 0% has a similar probability."Ford also tumbled to a 52-week low today, falling 2.9%.

Small caps: It pays to index
Hammering away at the misconception that it pays to seek active managers in supposedly "less efficient" sectors like small caps, S&P Dow Jones' Philip Murphy finds - even choosing among the top mutual fund share classes - an alarmingly small number of managers failed to beat the benchmarks.Starting at the March 2009 bottom and going out five years, only 9 of 139 share classes  beat the S&P SmallCap 600 benchmark (that's 5.9% of the starting set).Where alpha might be able to be delivered though, is in choosing which benchmark to track. A fund tracking the S&P SmallCap 600 (IJR, VIOO) would have outperformed one tracking the Russell 2000 (NYSEARCA:IWM) by 23% over the 5-year period.ETFs: IWM, TZA, IJS, TNA, IWC, UWM, VB, IJR, SLY, VBR, EES, RWJ, VBK, URTY, SCHA, TWM, IWN, IWO, IJT, RWM, SRTY, DWAS, SAA, VTWO, JKL, RZV, SLYG, SLYV, VIOO, SDD, PZI, RZG, FDM, SBB, RSCO, WMCR, VIOG, JKJ, VTWG, UKK, TILT, VIOV, FNDA, XSLV, FYX, FYT, EWRS, JKK, TWOK, SKK, VTWV, PXSV, SMLV, UVT, SJH, IESM, PXSC, VLU, FYC, PXSG Jul. 25, 2014, 2:31 PM | 11 Comments

Citigroup analysts have high hopes for GM earnings, not so much for Ford
Citigroup expects a big Q2 earnings beat from General Motors (GM -0.2%) but is somewhat less optimistic about Ford's (F +0.1%) results when the two automakers release their financial results on Thursday.The firm lifts its Q2 EPS estimate for GM to $0.63 vs. $0.57 consensus, led by North America, where it forecasts $1.7B adjusted EBIT (~11% margin excluding recall costs) on higher production/truck mix, exceptional pricing (Q2 ATPs up more than $600 Q/Q) and arguably easier structural cost comparisons; unlike last quarter, 2014 guidance should suggest an accelerating H2 EBIT pace consistent with GM’s June update.Cit's Q2 EPS for Ford is reduced to $0.36 mostly on taxes vs. $0.36 consensus, with pre-tax auto EBIT at $1.7B; although the firm isn't expecting an earnings beat, it believes the quarter/outlook could still result in upward 2014-15 Street revisions.

Massive number of U.S. auto recalls only dent sales slightly
Buried inside an economic report from the Richmond Federal Reserve this week is an interesting tidbit on the auto industry.As part of its scan of the economic horizon for the Beige Book, the bank noted the massive wave of automobile industry recalls has only had a "slight adverse" impact on sales. Customer traffic was still up and new car sales strong on solid pricing.The read from Richmond is consistent with recent U.S. sales reports from major automakers, although with a slight disconnect existing between a "sale" and a "delivery" in the industry the confirmation is noteworthy.Chaos theory: Some industry analysts think recalls can actually spur sales as safety is teed up as a consumer issue and older cars replaced.Related auto stocks: GM, F, TM, OTCPK:FIATY, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, TSLA, OTCQX:VLKAY, OTCPK:DDAIF, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:BAMXY, TTM, TSLA, AN, KMX, SONC.

Barron's: GM stock looks dirt cheap
GM is seeing strong results on the sales floor, and with a rock-bottom valuation and 3.3% yield, shares could rise 30%, according to a Barron's profile.Investors who look beyond the recall headlines will find much to like in GM, Jack Hough writes: U.S. light vehicle sales are the strongest since summer 2006, Europe's besieged car market has begun to recover with nine straight months of growth, and overall market share rose to 18.9% in June from 17.8% in May thanks to strong sales of SUVs and crossovers.GM will struggle to top $3 in EPS this year after recall costs and other expenses, but next year it could earn $5, with two-thirds of the increase coming from simply moving past one-time costs, Sterne Agee says; if that's right, GM now trades at 7.5x next year's earnings, an 18% discount to Ford (NYSE:F) and a 50% discount to the market.

Alcoa hits 52-week high as excitement builds over future of aluminum cars
Alcoa (AA) shares hit a 52-week high today amid reports that Ford's (F) lightweight Fusion concept car could provide a profound impact on aluminum demand and aluminum producers’ profits.The prototype unveiled Tuesday is ~800 pounds, or 25%, lighter than the regular Fusion model due to increased use of aluminum; Ford isn't selling the car for now, in part because the lighter materials are more expensive, but Sterne Agee says the vehicle confirms its "thesis of the automotive industry moving down an aluminum adoption curve beyond expectations."Given the momentum of automotive aluminum announcements over the last six months, Sterne Agee believes industry estimates for ~1.2M tons of automotive aluminum sheet usage by 2025 - as well as Alcoa's $1.3B revenue assumption for 2018 - are "very conservative."

Ford's F-150 the talk of Detroit
Top Ford (F -0.5%) exec Joe Hinrichs tells Automotive News the transition by the automaker to aluminum with its F-150 line is about more than just fuel economy savings.He notes the loss of 700 pounds of weight will improve towing, payload capabilities, and stopping distance for drivers.The F-150 project is one of the most closely-watched in the industry as Ford could set itself apart from peers or stumble if the new F-150 is perceived as less sturdy.Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne recently upped the ante by taking a few potshots at Ford for the use of aluminum in F-150s which brought a bristling response from management at Ford.

Automakers face big challenges as they look to tech solutions
Recall worries hit shares of Toyota (TM -1.5%) and Ford (F -0.5%) in early trading, while General Motors (GM -2.2%) has been stung by a harsh Morgan Stanley downgrade on top of its own recall crisis.A common thread between the spate of recent recalls and the line of reasoning behind the MS downgrade is the need for automobile manufacturers to upgrade and integrate technology inside of vehicles. There's a disparity on the design side between risk-tolerant tech firms and risk-averse automobile companies that could worsen as software fixes become part of the recall atmosphere."There’s no doubt the future of the industry is heavily dependent on building a bridge between Silicon Valley and the auto industry," notes Delphi's chief technical officer.What to watch: Today's faulty ignition switch could be tomorrow's coding error if the transition isn't done right.

Automobile sales made an impressive jump in the second week of February, according to data compiled by J.D. Power.Winter storms had auto sales for the month tracking 5% lower than a year ago, but a strong bounce has now cut the falloff to closer to 1%.

Ford unveils new F-150, built mostly with aluminum: Will customers approve?
Ford (F) today unveiled its new F-150 with a body built almost entirely out of aluminum, which shaves as much as 700 pounds off the 5,000-pound truck, a response to small-business owners’ desire for a more fuel-efficient and nimble truck - and stricter government requirements on fuel economy.It's a big risk: F-Series trucks - which include the F-150 and heavier duty models like the F-250 - have been the best-selling vehicles in the U.S. for the last 32 years, and Ford makes ~$10K profit on every F-Series truck it sells.The 2015 F-150 goes on sale late this year; although aluminum is more expensive that steel, Ford says the truck will stay within the current price range.Will customers accept the change? "Trucks are put to such hard use. They take bangs and dings and a lot of hard use," says a somewhat skeptical Kelley Blue Book editorial director Jack Nerad. "We'll see."

Automakers dazzle at CES, but what about privacy?
The intersection of technology and the automobile industry was on full display this week at the Consumer Electronics Show where a record number of automakers presented.Though the sneak peek at the new gadgetry and the evolution of on-board systems was quite impressive, there's a bit of backlash building on privacy issues.As more mobile devices connect to cars, and Google's Open Automototive Alliance and GM's OnStar system evolve, hyper-local marketing could take off. It's a gray area with few legal precedents, note privacy advocates.A Ford exec probably got a little too fired up at CES earlier this week with this comment: "We know everyone who breaks the law, we know when you're doing it. We have GPS in your car, so we know what you're doing."Related stocks: GM, F, TM, FIATY, HMC, NSANY, TSLA, VLKAY, DDAIF, HYMLF, BAMXY, TTM, FUJHY. Jan. 10, 2014, 9:26 AM | 11 Comments

Automakers in 2014: Gunning for a smashing year
Despite some recent concerns on the U.S. automobile industry - including high inventory at General Motors (GM) and pricing pressures at Ford (F) -  the industry is in the best shape that it's been in years, say some analysts.On demand: The average age of vehicles in the U.S. has never been higher at 11.3 years. Some pent-up demand from the fall when government shutdown worries stalled sales is also still being unleashed.On profits: Though a high level of promotional activity in December helped to juice sales figures at the expense of profits, some underlying positive trends remain in place. The increased use of domestic production in supply chains and the early success of 2014 models at premium pricing bodes well for bottom lines in the sector.On leased cars: Analysts think the lease cycle sets up well for the industry in 2014.Toyota (TM) has aggressive leasing plans in place.On gas mileage: Consumers will be tempted to trade into new vehicles with vastly improved gas mileage ratings. Honda (HMC) tops the list while Ford's betting truck owners will go for a lighter F-150 in the future. In the luxury segment, Tesla (TSLA) and Mercedes-Benz (DDAIF) want to carve out more EV market share by reeling in middle-class buyers trading up while cutting down on gas costs.On brand reputation: Automakers such as Subaru (FUJHY) and Chrysler (FIATY) have seen consumer sentiment scores turn around as new models impress.

Sherlund has previously suggested Mulally might cut costs, boost capital returns, and unload Xbox and Bing.However, FBR's Daniel Ives still thinks Mulally has a shot.

Ford board to press Mulally for clarity on future
Ford's (F) board of directors reportedly intends to press CEO Alan Mulally on his future amid intense speculation that he is a leading candidate to replace Steve Ballmer at Microsoft (MSFT).The board will discuss the matter at a meeting that is due to take place today.

"People don't write about Mustang, they don't write about earnings, they write about Mulally."Even if Mulally doesn't leave for Microsoft, he is unlikely to stay at Ford until the end of next year despite this being the current oft-repeated plan.

In response to remarks from Edsel Ford II stating Alan Mulally will remain at Ford (F +0.7%) until the end of 2014, Nomura's Rick Sherlund asserts Mulally will be Microsoft's (MSFT -3.6%) next CEO, and that an announcement could happen before the holidays.Sherlund: "If [Mulally] were not in discussions, it would be easy to say 'I am not interested and will not go.'"Sherlund has previously declared it "likely" Mulally will be named Steve Ballmer's successor, and has raised the possibility Microsoft's pending CEO change would lead to cost cuts, asset sales, and changes to the company's capital structure.Microsoft has bounced a little off its intraday lows following Sherlund's comments, but its market cap is still ~$9B lower than it was before Edsel Ford II's remarks.

U.S. auto sales strong but promotions a concern
Though it's clear that automobile sales in the U.S. are booming as the industry brushed aside a tough Superstorm Sandy-boosted comparison to topple the sales estimates of analysts, the level of promotional activity used to pull off the feat is up for debateTruecar.com estimates the average transaction price for major automakers declined by 0.6% Y/Y to $30,634.

AllThingsD: Mulally still top Microsoft CEO candidate, would act as "caretaker"
Sources tell AllThingsD Ford's (F -0.6%) Alan Mulally is still the top candidate (previous) to become Microsoft's (MSFT -0.9%) next CEO. However, the site adds Mulally (if chosen) would act as a "caretaker" paving the way for one of several internal candidates to eventually take the helm.Enterprise/cloud chief Satya Nadella, who headed a Server & Tools unit that was arguably Microsoft's biggest success story over the last decade, is said to be the top pick to be groomed for the top job. But COO Kevin Turner, ex-Skype CEO Tony Bates, and Stephen Elop are also said to be in the running.Meanwhile, Microsoft is holding its annual meeting today. The departing Steve Ballmer defended his company's investments in Xbox and Bing (a successor might have a different take), which some analysts/investors have called on the software giant to unload. He also took responsibility for the massive aQuantive write-down, but defended his willingness to make big acquisitions.In what's arguably another sign he's more engaged at Microsoft, Bill Gates appeared at the meeting.

European automobile market: Beware of taking on the Germans
Major automobile companies are making a big mistake in thinking they can increase profit margins by taking on German automakers (BAMXY.PK, VLKAY.PK, DDAIF.PK) in the luxury market on their home turf, argues Neil Winston of The Detroit News.The "delusional" strategy to invest in the high-end market - instead of slashing capacity and following the lead of the successful South Korean automakers (KIMTF.PK, HYMLF.PK) in Europe - has proven disastrous to automakers such as Saab, Renault (RNSDF.PK), and Volvo (VLKAY.PK) in the past.Peugeot (GM, PEUGF.PK) and Ford (F) are guilty of falling for the temptation to move more models into the European upscale market, while Fiat (FIATY.PK) is playing small ball on the continent.

Auto sales preview: The outlook looks strong for August and beyond
A calendar quirk works in the favor of automobile sales for August as the Labor Day weekend marks the 5th weekend of the month. The timing effect could be enough to lift the annual selling rate to over 16M units, according to forecasts from LMC Automotive and J.D. Power. Kelley Blue Book is a tad more conservative with an estimate of 15.6M.Though an aging U.S. fleet and macroeconomic factors are often cited as the major demand boosts for the industry, analysts think a higher percentage of loans over five years has helped ease pricing.It's not just the U.S. that is showing stronger automobile industry fundamentals. China continues to blaze ahead, while Europe and India are expected to start a slow recovery.Light-duty diesel vehicles and EVs catch their share of headlines, but it's new gas models from Detroit and Tokyo automakers which could spark sales.Related stocks: GM ,F, VLKAY.PK, TM, FIATY.PK, HMC, NSANY.OB, TSLA, DDAIF.PK, HYMLF.PK, BAMXY.PK, KIMTF.PK, VOLVY.PK, DAN, BWA, MTOR, TRW, GT, CTB, FDML, DLPH.

U.S. auto industry may be pushing capacity utilization limits: WSJ
"There has never been a time in the U.S. industry that we've had this high a level of capacity utilization," Oliver Wyman's Ron Harbour says, referring to the ~40% of North American car factories (F, GM, FIATY.PK) that now produce vehicles more than 80 hours per week (that figure was just 11% five years ago).While the pace of annualized vehicle sales is running less than 2M shy of 2005's record 17.5M pace, WSJ notes that the industry employs far fewer works now than eight years ago, (647,600 workers last year versus 925,700 in 2005).Agreements struck with unions have allowed the Big Three to add shifts and work their factories on nights and weekends.Some say the industry is bumping up against the upper limits of production and will be forced to increase capacity by expanding plants or building new factories.Nonsense, says Ford VP James Tetreault: "As a manufacturing guy, I never say we're maxed out."

U.S. weighing ending truck tariff
The U.S. might end a 50-year tariff on pickup trucks with the measure seen contributing to higher prices for consumers.Toyota (TM), Nissan (NSANY.OB), and Honda (HMC) already avoid the tariff by building trucks on U.S. soil, but other automakers have tread somewhat lightly in the U.S. in the truck segment.The Big Three (GM, F, FIATY.PK) have built up so much brand loyalty for their popular truck models that ending the tariff probably won't hurt the trio, and could actually help them raise sales if other markets like Japan are opened up as a counter-measure.

Japanese automakers (NSANY.OB, TM, HMC, MZDAY.PK, SZKMY.PK) are forecast to increase their market share in the U.S. this year and next, a development that isn't sitting too well with Ford (F) and General Motors (GM). The Detroit auto giants have already increased the rhetoric on the impact of currency "manipulation" by Japan and it won't be long before more U.S. politicians take up the issue. What to watch: With more production moving from Japan to North America, the yen becomes less of a wildcard, but that probably won't cool off the issue completely as even U.S.-made cars contain parts from Japan.

Luxury automakers in China have been reveling with outsized margins for a few years now, but analysts think that all that could change as the market in the nation matures. The Chinese luxury automobile is forecast to pass the U.S. in size as soon as 2016, but a shift to slightly smaller cars will impact the mix of vehicles sold.

Winners and losers from Chrysler's (FIATY.PK) fight with the NTHSA: Though it capitulated and agreed to a recall, Chrysler scored a cheap fix (adding trailer hitches) to what could have been a more expensive issue and protected its brand in front of the planned buyout by Fiat and eventual IPO. The NHTSA saves itself what may have been a painful process of going through discovery - while General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) got a free look at how a battle with the agency goes down. Consumers with 1993-2004 Grand Cherokees and 2002-07 Libertys walk away with a little extra value due to the new trailer hitch, but might still be wondering about those rear-end collisions.

Another twist to the debate on electric vehicles: Sales of EVs has cut into the revenue collected by states on gas purchases and used to pay for highway and bridge maintenance.

General Motors (GM) is pegged at a +250K unit month, while Toyota (TM) may have the lost the most market share. On the electric-vehicle front, a pricing war should lift sales a bit at the expense of profitability - while the Tesla Motors (TSLA) juggernaut rolls on.

May is an important month for the automobile industry after the last three years saw a post-Q1 dip in sales.

What to watch: A pickup in housing could help lift sales of full-sized pickups, while the average selling price for automakers (GM, F, FIATY.PK, NSANY.OB, TM, HMC, VLKAY.PK) should look strong as they take their foot off the promotional pedal.

The rationale: expectations of above-trend real GDP growth beginning next year (Mr. Evans' "escape velocity" ?) coupled with P/E multiple expansion to 16x. Furthermore, dividends should rise ~30% over the next two years, bolstering the firm's claim that dividend-paying equities (DVY) are one of the only places U.S. investors can look to for income-generation.

LMC Automotive thinks demand for automobiles in China will return to a double-digit pace next year and stay stable for the four to five years. It's a common enough forecast in the industry with IHS Automotive going so far as to say there is "no chance" for a negative growth environment in China due to the less than 7% of the population that owns a car. Rough forward-looking China capacity counts: General Motors (GM +1.4%) 5M vehicles a year; Hyundai and Kia (HYMLF.PK) combined 1.8M; Ford (F +0.4%) 1.2M by 2015; Volkswagen (VLKAY.PK) 4M by 2018.

Automobile industry snapshot: With a third of the year in the books, the fight for market share in the U.S. is being won by Ford (F), Chrysler (FIATY.PK), and Toyota while South Korean automakers stumble (KIMTF.PK, HYMLF.PK) and General Motors (GM) slowly recovers to where it stood six months ago.

On the EV front, the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt hope to take advantage of Tesla Motors (TSLA) pulling the plug on its 40-kWh version of the Model S.

The U.S. government will buy up to 10K hybrids to help trim fuel costs for the fleet of government cars. The marching orders come from the GSA which estimates savings of close to 1M gallons of fuel over the lifetime of the vehicles.

The latest batch of forecasts for auto sales indicates the SAAR will rise 5.3% to 15.3M. Though the pace of unit growth is considerably slower than the last three years, the sector has become less promotional as witnessed by the decent 3.1% rise in average transaction price in spite of the shift to less expensive automobiles. What to watch: A drop in vehicle inventory levels during April would be a good sign that the demand trend is still in place as the spring/summer selling season heats up and manufacturers haven't overshot with production.

The fight for China: The Shanghai Automobile Show isn't lacking for new models with close to 1.3K vehicles being showcased in the nation which has become the world's largest automobile market. Gaining an early edge in the nation is critical because the average age of a car buyer is only 35 - compared to closer to 55 in the U.S. - meaning early winners could parlay their brand success for decades.

The theme for U.S. automakers at the Shanghai Auto Show appears to be back to the future with both General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) refreshing old models for the market in China.

General Motors (GM) says the 2015 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo Diesel will deliver 46 miles per gallon, a rating higher than previous estimates from the automaker. What to watch: The era of Detroit gas guzzlers appears to be long gone as the Big Three (GM, F, FIATY.PK) continue to deliver vehicles (diesel and non-diesel) which meet or exceed mileage ratings from Japanese automakers (TM, HMC) for comparable models. The trend from Detroit could also have some impact on EV sales (NSANY.OB, TSLA) if consumers decide catching +40 mpg fuel economy is "green" enough.

This year, expanding local joint venture production and introducing luxury models will be top priorities for the industry.

The Big Three automakers (GM, F, FIATY.PK) are impressing analysts and consumers at the New York International Auto Show with a fresh slate of models that consumers will actually want to buy. It's in stark contrast to the recent Geneva Motor Show where a parade of struggling European automakers bumped up against each other with glitzy cars aimed at competing with high-end models from Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Rolls-Royce. What to watch: March auto sales in the U.S. could topple a 15M annual selling rate with the Big Three picking up momentum.

March is expected to see a record 48K units sold with some forecasts ranging as high as 60K. A fresh slate of offerings and lower prices  is attracting new buyers.

Another electric vehicle bombshell: A new report from McKinsey indicates a third of all electric vehicle owners in Japan say they won't buy another with the nation's infrastructure not yet ready to support a network of charging stations.

Automobile sales fell 10.2% Y/Y in Europe during February to 829K, according to the Association of European Car Manufacturers.

Things are starting to get interesting in China's automobile market. Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) hope to continue to benefit from the falloff of Japanese automakers (HMC, TM, NSANY.OB) through their local joint ventures, but domestic firms are starting to understand the need to ramp up quality and innovation in order to compete. As it stands now, domestic brands only account for a third of all sales - short of the Beijing's target for 40% share. Volkswagen (VLKAY.PK) appears to be all-in with 70% of its new plants slated for China, while even Tesla Motors (TSLA) thinks it can make a splash in the region. Mar. 14, 2013, 12:59 PM | 9 Comments

Do automakers stand a chance of increasing electric vehicle sales in China? Though the talk from major companies (F, GM, VLKAY.PK, TM) is that they plan to start or ramp up electric sales in China - and even Tesla Motors (TSLA +1.4%) plans to open a dealership in the nation - by all accounts EV sales in China are stuck in neutral. Mind-blowing levels of smog in Beijing this year have elevated the debate on vehicle emissions, but until the government actively decides to sacrifice economic growth for environmentally friendly practices the EV initiatives are speculative.

Though the trend is particularly hard to swallow for Volkswagen (VLKAY.PK), BMW (BAMXY.PK), and Daimler (DDAIF.PK) trying to boost sales on their home turf, it also affects the automobile sector (GM, F, NSANY.OB, TM, HMC, TSLA) as a whole as it looks toward Germany for answers on the continent-wide demand slump.

Are the Big Three (GM, FIATY.PK, F) exiting Europe fast enough? Another month of double-digit (Y/Y) declines in registrations on the continent and ongoing losses don't even tell the whole story. It's a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer with German automakers Daimler (DDAIF.PK), BMW (BAMXY.PK), and Volkswagen (VLKAY.PK) on the right side of the equation and Detroit's trio stuck in the mud.

China's retail sales shot up 14.9% in October, providing companies selling in the region a reason to breath just a tad bit easier. The China Generak Chamber of Commerce estimates retail sales will surpass 20 trillion yuan ($3.21T) in 2012 and add another 15% to that mark by 2015. But the trick for U.S. companies with China is to move into rural areas in order to tap into growth potential without stepping into quicksand if brand recognition isn't strong or prices are too high.

The flap over fuel economy claims by automakers brings up an interesting point. While EPA testing is done at just below highway speed limits, drivers in the spacious Midwest are likely to topple that average quite a bit. Edmunds.com editor John O'Dell notes cities drivers have a much larger economic incentive to drive an electric vehicle than a rural drivers based on that notion of non-efficiency. Perhaps doubly so after factoring in the trick of finding a charging station in the middle of Nebraska. Dec. 7, 2012, 2:58 PM | 10 Comments
