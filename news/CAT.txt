Caterpillar +1% after denying tax fraud allegations
Caterpillar (CAT +1%) moves higher after denying allegations that may have broken U.S. tax laws during the 2007-12 period."We disagree with the IRS' position, have cooperated for requests for information, and believe that we are compliant with tax laws and stand by our financial reporting," the company says.The statement comes a week after CAT's headquarters and other facilities were raided by federal agencies including the IRS.

Analyst compares Caterpillar accounting woes to former high-flier Lucent
Caterpillar (CAT -0.9%) shares hold up fairly well in the face of the New York Times story of a new report commissioned by the U.S. government accusing the company of carrying out tax and accounting fraud.Axiom Capital analyst Gordon Johnson worries the news “may be just the beginning of CAT’s accounting woes,” and compares the situation to Lucent, the high-flying communications stock in the late 90s and early 2000s that eventually crashed."Based on our analysis of CAT filings, where we observe aggressive revenue recognition as well as an unprecedented rise in inventories... we believe CAT has engaged in similar activities to Lucent in order to make a once-in-two-decade, one-time mining capex bubble appear sustainable," Johnson writes.

Caterpillar dips on accusations of tax fraud
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) -2.3% premarket on a new government report accusing the heavy equipment maker of carrying out tax and accounting fraud."I believe that the company’s noncompliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price," wrote Leslie A. Robinson, author of the report.

Report to federal investigators accuses Caterpillar of tax fraud
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is accused in a report commissioned by the U.S. government of carrying out tax and accounting fraud, NY Times reports.“Caterpillar did not comply with either U.S. tax law or U.S. financial reporting rules,” wrote Leslie Robinson, Dartmouth accounting professor and the author of the report. “I believe that the company’s non-compliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price."The report, which has not been made public or made available to CAT, outlines a company strategy for bringing home billions of dollars from offshore affiliates while avoiding federal income taxes on those earnings, according to NYT.CAT’s tax practices have been a focus of government investigators since 2014, and the company has since disclosed that the IRS is seeking more than $2B in income taxes and penalties on profits earned by a Swiss subsidiary; last week, federal agents raided three CAT facilities near its Illinois headquarters as part of the investigation (I, II, III).

Caterpillar likely to raise guidance - Evercore ISI
Analyst David Raso expects Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) presentation next week at ConExpo to give the Street the impression it's going to boost at least its revenue guidance.Whether there's much of a bump for EPS guidance is more debatable, he says.In the red all session, CAT shares have moved modestly into the green since Raso's note hit.

WSJ Heard On The Street: Caterpillar raid is a wake-up call
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares stabilized today following yesterday's 4% drop after the IRS and other federal agencies raided the company's headquarters and other offices (I, II, III).But investor relief may be ill advised, Charley Grant writes for WSJ's Heard On The Street, as CAT's Trump-fueled run higher has pushed its debt-adjusted market value to more than 2.2x forward sales projections, near a 10-year high, and the company's tax situation could make justifying that multiple even harder.Grant also notes that shares have rallied even while analysts have repeatedly cut earnings forecasts; analyst consensus for adjusted EPS has tumbled to ~$3/share after ending 2015 with expectations for more than $4/share.But there's no denying the stock's resiliency: CAT shares have bounced right back each time they dipped below the 100-day moving average over the past 12 months.

Caterpillar CEO apologizes over raid
Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) chief executive apologized to the firm's employees after federal agents raided three of the company's Illinois facilities, including headquarters."We were surprised by today's actions primarily because we have been so cooperative with the authorities in this investigation," CEO Jim Umpleby said in an internal memo. "We will continue to work toward a resolution of these matters, just as we did today."Any more details? "Because of the broad nature of today's warrant, we don't have enough information at this time to provide a full understanding of the authorities' intent," he declared.Previously: Caterpillar closes -4.3% as investors weigh effects of probe into tax issues (Mar. 02 2017)

Caterpillar closes -4.3% as investors weigh effects of probe into tax issues
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) closed -4.3% after federal agents raided its Illinois offices, marking the stock's worst one-day decline since June and whacking ~30 points from the DJIA.WSJ reports the search appears to escalate an investigation into tax issues related to CAT’s parts business and financial transactions involving one of the company’s subsidiaries in Switzerland; CAT said in its 10-K filing last month that it is “vigorously contesting” ~$2B in additional tax and penalties it says the IRS is proposing to collect on “profits earned from certain parts transactions” by the Swiss subsidiary.Evercore ISI analyst David Raso says CAT could, at the high end, see a ~$0.30/share cut to its EPS run rate depending on whether CAT has to pay the full $2B in back taxes and penalties and potentially pay higher taxes; placing a 15x multiple on a $0.30 EPS run rate adds up to a $4.50 hit, close to the decline in CAT shares today.Update: In a statement, CAT confirms the search and seizure, and believes it is related to export filings related to the Swiss subsidiary, as first disclosed in its 10-K from February 2015 and updated in last month's 10-K.

The manufacturer vs. retailer showdown
Chief executives from some of the nation's biggest manufacturers are calling on House and Senate leadership to overhaul the corporate tax code and embrace a proposal that would reduce the cost of exports but penalize imports."We applaud your efforts to pursue tax reform that is both big and bold," the letter states. "Incremental tweaks will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth."Among the 16 executives who signed the letter are CEOs from Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - all part of the newly formed American Made Coalition.The plan faces significant opposition from the retail industry, however, with top industry leaders flying to Washington last week to press their case. They have established their own lobbying group, the Coalition for Affordable Products.Previously: Heavyweight retail CEOs to meet with POTUS (Feb. 15 2017)

Caterpillar (CAT) reports an 8% Y/Y decline in worldwide retail machine sales for the rolling three-month period ending in January retail data, a slower rate of descent than the reported 12% drop in December and the 17% slide in November.CAT says global sales to resource industries fell 7% during the three-month rolling period, better than the 10% drop in the prior period, while retail sales to construction fell 8% vs. a 12% drop in previous period.Total sales in the energy and transportation segment slipped 11%, an improvement from December's 22% drop, including respective declines of 15%, 15%, 8% and 7% in power generation, transportation, oil and gas, and industrial products.

Caterpillar to establish global HQ in Chicago
Caterpillar (CAT -1.1%) will relocate a number of senior execs and support staff to the Chicago area later this year as it works to establish its global headquarters in the city.The company will still maintain a "significant" presence in the Peoria, Illinois, where it will continue to have the bulk of its employees, but will no longer build its previously announced HQ complex there."Since 2012, about two-thirds of Caterpillar's sales and revenues have come from outside the U.S.," said CEO Jim Umpleby. "Locating our headquarters closer to a global transportation hub... means we can meet with our global customers, dealers and employees more easily and frequently."

Caterpillar rebounds as analyst sees "green shoots" not far away
Caterpillar (CAT +1.1%) shares are bouncing back, making it likely that yesterday’s decline was a blip on the way to further gains, Credit Suisse analysts say in reiterating their Outperform rating.The firm notes that while CAT trimmed 2017 guidance, mining aftermarket improved sequentially for the third quarter in a row and Q4 2016 represented the first Y/Y improvement, and December orders were up by double digits for resources broadly and for construction in North America and the EU.CAT also sees pricing as neutral to positive for 2017, implying that the worst is over, and dealer inventory levels seem in better shape, boosting Credit Suisse's confidence that "green shoots are more in the near term vs. further out."Wells Fargo upgrades shares to Outperform from Market Perform with a $116-$119 target range, up from $92-$95, as goodwill impairment risk is diminishing while revenue and earnings appear likely to improve from a cyclical bottom.

"I'm confident we are focusing on the right areas: controlling costs, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investing in the key areas important to our future."Guidance for 2017: Full-year earnings of $2.30 per share, on revenue of $36B-$39B (slightly lower at the midpoint than the $38B projected in December).CAT -1.4% premarketQ4 results

Competing takes on Deere as ag market may bottom out in 2017
Deere & Co. (DE +0.2%) is set to benefit from a bottoming agricultural market in the coming year, according to a Baird note today.That's in spite of a strong Q4. Shares are up 21% in the past three months.Baird's Mircea Dobre has a $117 price target, implying 13% upside, and an Outperform rating. A bottom's coming as "North American large Ag equipment volumes are approaching prior cyclical bottoms, high horsepower equipment sales/planted acres are near 40-year lows, large Ag new equipment inventories have destocked near historical lows and while auction used equipment prices are still pressured, deterioration is nowhere near 2013-15 as selling conditions seem to be improving into 2017," Dobre writes.Barclays is not as enthusiastic. The firm has several equipment stocks where the only upside thesis would be that prior peak earnings become the new normal. "That is the case, more or less, for Deere, for Paccar (PCAR -0.3%), and for Caterpillar (CAT -0.4%)."Deere's trading at a multiple of 9-10 times the 2013 peak ag machinery sales number, analyst Robert Wertheimer notes. "We estimate another 3-4 years to run in the downcycle, then a few more up to normal." With a generous assumption of a multiple of 15, that would put Deere at $150 in the future; if that's five years away at a 9% discount, that implies about $105 today, he says.

A month-long recovery in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is helping to take the Dow ever so close the 20K threshold. The Dow stocks with the largest YTD gains are Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), both up +38%. Nike (NYSE:NKE) is the laggard of the group, but could cut into its YTD 19% loss with a solid read on futures orders later today when it reports FQ2 earnings.Investors who like pyschological breaking points are also watching the currency markets.

Higher steel prices could be bad news for Caterpillar, Navistar, Agco
Machinery stocks such as Caterpillar (CAT -1.5%), Navistar (NAV -3.2%) and Agco (AGCO -1.5%) have priced in the positive impact from tax cuts, infrastructure spending and a stronger economy, but they do not necessarily reflect the negative impact from rising commodity prices, Barclays analysts say.Rising commodities are normally a positive for machinery and industrials, but Barclays believes the market is still in overhang from the last cycle, which included some of the largest fleet builds in history in construction, mining, locomotive, agriculture, and oil and gas, and used pricing remains weak and sometimes is still falling.The firm cuts its out-year EPS for Agco to $2.50 from $2.90, for CAT to $3.16 from $3.60, and for NAV to a loss of $0.17 from a loss of $0.10.

Moody's downgrades Caterpillar, sees no meaningful recovery until 2018
Moody's downgrades Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) ratings to A3 from A2, saying the company has been challenged and likely will remain challenged with relatively low returns, particularly regarding EBITA margins and returns on assets throughout all phases of the business cycle.The firm does not anticipate any meaningful recovery in CAT's markets until 2018, and says new machine sales are unlikely to begin to be realized until well after a market recovery is evident.CAT's outlook is stable, reflecting the company's ample financial and operating flexibility given the inherent cyclicality in its markets.

Fitch lowers Caterpillar outlook to negative
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) touched 52-week highs in early trading but closed -1.1%, near lows of the day, after Fitch Ratings revised CAT's outlook to Negative from Stable on concerns about the extended downturn in the company's machinery markets.Fitch says CAT could face challenges in rebuilding its operating and financial performance, and that a slow recovery in demand could prevent the company from returning to stronger credit metrics; even if the recovery is strong, free cash flow could be constrained if CAT fails to fully realize benefits from recent restructuring moves.CAT launched a restructuring program in 2015 that aims to cut costs by $1.5B/year; shares have gained 42% YTD even as sales have declined for eight straight quarters and the company recently warned that 2017 forecasts seemed too optimistic.

Caterpillar’s Trump-related optimism out of hand, analyst says
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is the Dow's best performer YTD, surging 43%, and has jumped 15% since the election, as investors see the company as a prime beneficiary of Pres.-elect Trump’s promises to boost infrastructure spending and revive the mining industry, but Macquarie's Sameer Rathod says the optimism has gone too far.Investors have paid little heed to management’s assertion last week that analyst consensus for 2017 EPS of $3.25 on revenue of $38B was "too optimistic."Rathod thinks the U.S. earth-moving equipment market could improve in 2017, but they still rate CAT at Underperform with a 12-month stock price target of $58.50, which implies a 40% plunge from current levels, saying CAT's global footprint - it derives just 40.9% of its revenue from the U.S., along with exposures of 8.4% to China, 5.5% to Canada and 3.5% to Brazil - could end up hurting the company after Trump becomes president.Free trade has "provided secular demand for CAT’s end markets,” the analyst says. “Pres.-elect Trump’s views on killing trade deals as well as being aggressive on anti-dumping duties would be detrimental to global growth and trade and is likely going to be a negative for aggregate commodity demand.”

Caterpillar considers 2017 $3.25 EPS consensus overly optimistic, $38B in sales reasonable
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares had been halted earlier this hour pending the disclosure.On FY 2017 revenue, labels $38B consensus forecast "a reasonable midpoint expectation," citing sustained commodity prices, China construction, developing nations construction and encouragement on potential U.S. infrastructure bill, tax reform, new regulation, commodity prices and recent OPEC developments. However, cites concerns involving volatile oil prices, North American weakness, economic growth in Europe post-Brexit, power generation and North American rail customer sales.For 2017 EPS, views $3.25 "too optimistic considering expected headwinds," noting that at $38B, sales are approximately $1B lower than 2016 outlook, resulting in a variable margin headwind of $350M-$450M. Additionally observes short-term incentive compensation for employees projected to come in $500M-$600M higher than in 2016 and for Cat Financial to be unfavorable at around $100M. On the tailwind side, sees $300M-$400M in cost reduction carryover resulting from restructuring activities, and further, cost reductions and operational improvements to be favorable at $300M-$500M.Remains committed to decrementals of 25%-30%, excluding restructuring costs.Caterpillar shares +0.63% at $96.16.Credit Suisse conference presentation (ongoing)

Deere cruises to record highs after earnings rout expectations
Deere (DE +11.3%) powers to all-time highs following its easy FQ4 earnings and revenue beats, as factors ranging from machinery pricing to lower overheads spending helped it report a much smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly earnings, CFO Raj Kalathur said during today's earnings conference call.DE forecasts FY 2017 sales of its farm and construction equipment will fall by 1% Y/Y, but analysts were expecting sales to drop by ~3% after sliding 9.3% to $23.4B in 2016, and predicts next year's profit will slip by just 1% following a 21% decline in 2016 to $1.5B.DE also said prices for new and used equipment firmed in the quarter, taking pressure off dealers to offer discounts that squeeze margins."It's not that the cycle is turning, it is that they are managing it better than before," Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann says.Caterpillar (CAT +2.7%), which has some market overlap with DE, surges to its best levels since December 2014, while AGCO (AGCO +3.4%), Lindsay, CNH Industrial (CNHI +4.7%) and Tractor Supply (TSCO +0.8%) also are higher.

Here are some Trump stocks - Barron's
Barron's speaks with several prominent money managers.They are hopeful that Donald Trump will enact pro-growth tax and fiscal-stimulus policies, while avoiding overly protectionist measures.Even though biotech stocks have already rallied 10%, fund manager Arun Daniel believes that the benefits of a Trump administration on the bottom lines of biotech and drug companies are not yet fully priced in.  ETFs: IBB, XBI, BIB, BBH, FBT, HQL, PBE, BIS, LABU, BBC, BBP, CNCR, LABD, UBIO, ARKG, ZBIO, LABSHe's also bullish on stocks leveraged to government-backed infrastructure spending, his favorites being Jacobs Engineering (NYSE:JEC) and Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM).Some companies will likely be allowed to repatriate billions of dollars of profits at a low tax rate. Major beneficiaries could include Nike (NYSE:NKE), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).Neuberger Berman's Joseph Amato says that a Trump administration will be better for stocks than bonds. "If [Trump] takes a measured approach and gets some level of concessions for U.S. workers, the trade concerns may be much ado about nothing," Amato says. "But that's a big if."

Caterpillar +8% on hopes for Trump infrastructure plans
Investors are betting that some big U.S. manufacturers such as Caterpillar (CAT +7.7%) could benefit from possible changes in energy, climate and tax policies in the Trump administration.CAT is "looking forward to building those bridges," says VP for global government and corporate affairs Kathryn Dickey Karol, adding that the company is excited about Trump’s calls for improving the U.S. transportation network.CAT says it will continue to push for adoption of the Trans-Pacific Partnership during the remaining days of the Obama administration; Martin Richenhagen, Chairman and CEO of farm equipment maker Agco (AGCO +0.9%), says he is concerned about Trump’s repeated support for trade protectionism during the campaign.The potential for federal spending boosted the likes of Fluor (FLR +10.1%), Aecom (ACM +12.6%), Jacobs Engineering (JEC +9.8%), Manitowoc (MTW +14.2%), Terex (TEX +14.8%), Vulcan Materials (VMC +9.8%) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM +11.5%).Shares in Deere (DE +1.4%), Paccar (PCAR +4.5%) and Navistar (NAV +7.2%) also are higher.

Caterpillar's YTD bull run is dead, Raymond James analysts say
"The Caterpillar kills the bull," Raymond James analysts proclaim, believing yesterday's earnings report should end any arguments for CAT shares (I, II) heading higher after gaining 24% YTD.CAT noted specifically that construction activity and construction equipment sales in North America during H2 2016 would come in lower than expected in its previous 2016 outlook, and that “this weakness could continue into 2017.”Although sentiment around mining has "definitely improved, there are still many idle trucks on customer sites, and we have not seen an increase in orders for new equipment," CAT said.Barclays notes that revenues declined in all segments, but operating margins rose in construction and energy and transportation while falling modestly in resources - a pattern the firm says is not typical for machinery companies, a disconnect it suspects is due to substantial and solid restructuring.

Caterpillar falls as struggles seen continuing into 2017
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) fell 1.7% in today's trade after posting a Q3 earnings beat but cutting its sales forecast for a fourth time and warning of continued weakness next year as miners and builders defer orders amid sluggish growth and low commodity prices.CAT cautiously points to potentially optimistic signs for 2017 - commodity prices are off their lows, there are signs of improvement in the Chinese construction market, and construction sales in Russia and Brazil may be bottoming - but it also predicts construction activity and equipment sales in North America will continue falling short of predictions, and notes continued uncertainty in Europe in the wake of the U.K.’s Brexit vote.CAT's $0.85 in EPS and $9.16B in revenues for Q3 represent a significant Y/Y decline from a respective $1.05 and $10.96B, yet the stock has made significant gains over the last 12 months, suggesting the market is betting on conditions improving soon for the company even as the lower guidance indicates that is not going to happen, Martin Tillier writes.

Caterpillar slips after lowering forecasts
Q3 EPS excluding restructuring costs of $0.85 compares to $1.05 a year ago, on revenue of $9.2B vs. $11B a year earlier."Economic weakness throughout much of the world persists and, as a result, most of our end markets remain challenged," CEO Doug Oberhelman said. "However, there were a few bright spots this quarter... I'm pleased with how Caterpillar has responded and our team's incredible focus on reducing costs and pulling through profit despite sluggish end markets."Guidance for 2016: Full-year earnings of $3.25 a share (vs. $3.55 previously), on revenue of about $39B (vs. $40B-$40.5B). Restructuring costs, which were anticipated to be about $700M, are now expected to be about $800M.CAT -2.4% premarketQ3 results

Chanos reiterates short bets on Caterpillar, Tesla
Jim Chanos tells CNBC he is still shorting Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) since the company's fundamental story has not changed, and reiterates the combination of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY) is "completely perplexing" and "makes no sense."CAT is up ~30% YTD but Chanos claims "the fundamentals by our view have not yet changed... [regarding the real estate and debt bubble in China] the collapse has not happened, the unwind has not happened. That's ahead of us, not behind us.""The supercycle in commodities that peaked out in '11 and '12... was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing," Chanos says. "The overcapacity that exists in mining, mining equipment, construction equipment is serious."On TSLA, Chanos says the company would double its cash burn by taking over SCTY and calls the deal a “big distraction.” Oct. 19, 2016, 5:47 PM | 65 Comments
CAT CEO Oberhelman's early departure is warning, some analysts say
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) finished slightly lower in today's trade, with some analysts saying the timing of CEO Doug Oberhelman’s departure this coming March signals that CAT’s sales woes will continue into 2017.CAT's revenue already was expected to fall an additional 1.6% in 2017 after a nearly 15% drop this year, which would give the company its lowest revenue total since 2009, the year Oberhelman became CEO-elect; Bloomberg's Brooke Sutherland says the decision to step down raises the question of whether CAT's actual outlook could be even worse.Oberhelman, at age 63, was believed to have a few more years left with which he could try to redeem himself while reversing CAT's multi-year sales decline triggered by the global commodities slump.CEO-designate Jim Umpleby currently is group president for energy and transportation, and J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan predicts a learning curve, noting that much of the energy and transportation business is sold directly to end customers and not through dealers.Part of the transition has CAT splitting its CEO and chairman roles for the first time since 1990, pleasing investors and analysts who have called for a stronger check on the CEO’s power.CFRA Research still rates CAT a Sell, as demand for new heavy machinery will likely remain low with a "lack of any positive catalysts on the horizon."

WSJ: Caterpillar's big bet backfires
The possibility of a commodity collapse apparently wasn't on Doug Oberhelman's mind when he took over as CEO at Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) in 2010. Between then and 2013, he plowed nearly $10B into plants and equipment, just as miners began shelving buying plans amid retreating commodity prices.Adding to that, Chinese growth began slowing, and then oil prices collapsed.Oberhelman's company is now facing an unprecedented fourth straight year of declining sales, and while the stock has bounced nicely this year, it's still 25% below its 2012 peak.Glass half full: CAT continues to be the world's largest construction and mining equipment seller, and is gaining market share. The workforce has been trimmed 20% over the past four years, creating a more nimble company ready to handle to next upturn.Source: Bob Tita in the WSJ

Apple, Qualcomm, and CVS favorites as Joel Greenblatt talks shop
"Value investing works like clockwork, but sometimes your clock has to be very slow," says Joel Greenblatt, asked in a Barron's interview about the recent underperformance of some of his funds. The man behind the classic "You Can Be A Stock Market Genius" also published a barely-read "The Big Secret For The Small Investor" five years ago, noting, among other things, that average investors tend to dump good strategies at precisely the wrong time.Favorite longs in his long/short portfolio now include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with double-digit cash flow yields vs. the S&P 500 at less than half of that. "People worry that it’s effectively a hardware company that will crash and burn. But it’s also an ecosystem of products that play with one another and a brand people like."He owns not just Apple, he says, but a "bucket" of Apples - companies with gushing cash flow, huge returns on capital, and nice market niches. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and CVS fit the bill.On the short side is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) at 218x pretax earnings and 7x sales. Even if optimistic earnings estimates prove true, it's still selling for 50x. Others include Costco (NASDAQ:COST) - a great retailer, but still a retailer - at 28x earnings, but not growing and also competing with Amazon. Another is Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), which has fans thanks to its 3.5% yield, but doesn't earn enough to pay that dividend.Gotham funds: GENIX, GARIX, GONIX, GINDX

Caterpillar no longer a dog, rising 7% in two days
Caterpillar (CAT +1.8%) rises to a new 52-week high as it builds on yesterday's breakout momentum following OPEC's agreement to cut production.CAT has been one of many companies to suffer alongside commodities price, but as oil and gold have rebounded in 2016, so has mining supplier CAT, and the stock has surged more than 7% over the past two days.In addition to the commodity comeback, Longbow Research's Eli Lustgarten says CAT's 2016 surge is due to "accelerated restructuring as well as the company downsizing to a new reality."Deutsche Bank recently tabbed CAT as one of its top picks, believing that natural resource markets have bottomed, and CAT can grow earnings independent of volumes.Some technical analysts are getting excited too: Now that CAT has broken through the $84 level that Evercore ISI's Rich Ross said served as "resistance," he says the stock presents an attractive buying opportunity.

Heavy-equipment glut weighs on machine makers
Used machinery is flooding the secondhand market, piling more pain on equipment makers battling slack demand amid a global slump in the value of everything from coal to corn, WSJ reports.Dealers, in turn, are keeping smaller inventories of new wheel loaders, backhoes and other machinery. That is hurting sales for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Volvo (OTCPK:VOLVY), Deere (NYSE:DE) and other manufacturers.Rental businesses account for half of new equipment sales in the U.S., and some analysts see that climbing to 60% within five years.

Caterpillar started with Buy rating at Deutsche Bank as cost cuts pay off
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is initiated with a Buy rating and a $98 price target at Deutsche Bank, which believes 2016 represents the cyclical trough for CAT's earnings.Deutsche Bank says 64% of CAT’s revenue is finally reaching bottom, as natural resource capex approaches cyclical lows; the firm says it does not anticipate a V-shaped recovery by any means, but does "see scope for a positive inflection" in mining, well servicing and Brazil construction in 2017.The firm says its 2017 EPS estimate of $4.03 sits 13% above consensus, as it thinks Wall Street is underestimating cost cutting benefits, noting that the cuts have been structural rather than temporary; even in an environment of modest volume growth, Deutsche Bank believes CAT can grow EPS 15% Y/Y.

Caterpillar (CAT +0.8%) is upgraded to Buy from Hold with a $92 price target at Argus, believing that CAT’s business has begun to improve, albeit slowly, and the stock's valuation remains attractive despite gaining 30% in the past three months.Although CAT’s business is highly cyclical, the firming up of key commodity prices could lead to better results in the near future, Argus analyst John Eade says, adding that the company has been taking steps to restructure its business, has a robust balance sheet and is focused on returning capital to shareholders.Most analysts remain cautious on CAT; Longbow Research, for one, said yesterday that shares have been responding to industry speculation about a recovery in China but that's not yet reason enough to re-rate the stock.Now read Caterpillar at a crawl Apr. 26, 2016, 3:19 PM | 6 Comments

Caterpillar, Joy Global raised to Neutral from Sell at Goldman
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Joy Global (NYSE:JOY) are upgraded to Neutral from Sell at Goldman Sachs, which lifts its outlook on the machinery industry to Neutral from Cautious as signs of a China recovery appear to be broadening.The sustained recovery in China construction, which has driven iron ore spot 20% higher since February, was unexpected and could drive a recovery in machinery share of mining capex, Goldman analyst Jerry Revich contends; the firm raises its CAT stock price target to $78 from $62.Despite concern over JOY’s exposure to high cost mining regions longer-term, Revich sees potential for a capex recovery in the event of continued recovery in China construction; the firm's price target for the shares is lifted to $24 from $13.CAT +0.7%, JOY +1% premarket.Now read Caterpillar: The worst is over and Caterpillar: It will get worse before it gets better Apr. 25, 2016, 9:13 AM | 4 Comments
Caterpillar added 20% to earnings with accounting trick, research firm says
Caterpillar's (CAT -0.6%) latest disappointing quarter could have been considerably worse if not for an accounting trick that added 20% to earnings, according to accounting research firm CFRA.CAT made two significant changes in how it calculates pension costs entering 2016, and CFRA estimates that the benefit from the changes will account for ~21.5% of the company’s earnings in 2016."It is important to understand that these changes are non-cash in nature and any earnings growth from the changes will not be sustainable," CFRA says, adding that the changes could be a drag on earnings growth in future years depending on interest rate movements.Now read Caterpillar to take out $85 a share before June Apr. 22, 2016, 3:40 PM | 8 Comments
Caterpillar dips after cutting full-year guidance
Q1 EPS excluding restructuring costs of $0.67 compares to $2.07 a year ago, on revenue of $9.5B vs. $12.7B a year earlier."While we are seeing a few positive signals, other parts of our business remain challenged," CEO Doug Oberhelman said. "As a result, we have lowered the midpoint of the outlook for 2016 revenues about 2%."Sales in 2016 are now expected to be in a range of $40B-$42B (vs. $40B-$44B), while the profit outlook is anticipated to be $3.70 per share excluding restructuring costs (vs. $4.00).Restructuring costs are also expected to be much higher, about $550M in 2016, up $150M from the previous outlook.

Axiom Capital turns bearish on Caterpillar
Axiom Capital's Gordon Johnson explains why he's feeling pessimistic about Caterpillar (CAT +1.4%) despite its 17% rise so far this year:"A key theme underpinning our negative outlook on Caterpillar rests on our steadfast view of deteriorating macro conditions, which we argue has been evident in Caterpillar’s numbers, given that it has: (1) been selling out of backlog for five straight quarters (2) saw EBITDA falls, and has (3) dismal dealer sales.""Although management has stated that a cyclical bottom "needs to be getting pretty close," we believe the company has entered a "new normal" that is unlikely to see future growth mirroring the "heydays" of the last upcycle.""Moreover, on top of the ongoing economic malaise in Latin America and China, given a softening U.S. construction sector, evidenced by negative Dodge construction data and a tepid Architectural Billing Index, we see Caterpillar’s Construction Industries segment likely worsening."Caterpillar will report Q1 results on Friday.Now read Don't Buy Caterpillar Yet, Wait Until The Dust Settles Apr. 19, 2016, 11:05 AM | 12 Comments

Macquarie still negative on Caterpillar, but China excavator market hits bottom
Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) 2% advance made the stock one of today's top Dow gainers, but Macquarie analyst Sameer Rathod continues to rate CAT at Underperform with a $51 price target, believing the company will see declining earnings into 2017 given the company's oil and gas exposure.Rathod thinks the Chinese excavator market is finding a bottom - although coming at ~90% off the peak - but "it will take a considerable time before we see a meaningful upturn in Chinese excavators, given the over-investment in fixed assets since the financial crisis."CAT can expect to face pricing pressure near-term in the Chinese excavator market, but the news isn't all bad, as CAT's strong market share in the country will help the company navigate those hiccups in the long term, Rathod says.Now read Dump Caterpillar and Deere on any market strength, Macquarie says Apr. 12, 2016, 5:46 PM | 1 Comment

Caterpillar EPS estimate cut by 32% at BMO; 2017 seen as another down year
BMO Capital cuts its Q1 EPS estimate for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) by 32% to $0.70 from $1.03 after the company's guidance for the period came in below expectations, but raises its full-year EPS view by $0.05 to $3.65 as it "recognize(s) the potential for the company to use various levers to move EPS as close as possible to its $4.00 guidance."One lever, BMO says, is CAT's ability to aggressively buy back shares with $5.5B remaining of a $10B repurchase authorization; share repurchases ($2B worth added ~$0.15 to 2015 results), lower tax rates (+$0.13) and reduction in incentive compensation are on the table, BMO believes.Upside from aggressive cost-saving actions should reach ~$400M in 2016, but BMO warns that 2017 will be another down year and sees CAT's ability to show EPS resiliency will diminish as the company runs out of various levers to pull.

Caterpillar says SEC concludes probe into replacement parts business
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) says the SEC has wrapped up its investigation of the company's replacement parts business, but probes by a federal grand jury and the IRS continue.CAT says the SEC notified it in December that the investigation was concluded without recommending a penalty but offers no additional details about the agency’s findings.The SEC began looking into a CAT-created subsidiary in Switzerland in 2014 after a U.S. Senate subcommittee described the unit as part of a strategy by the company to reduce its U.S. taxes from sales of replacement parts for equipment outside of the U.S.CAT reiterates in a 10-K filing that it did nothing illegal in the structuring of its foreign subsidiary, and that the outcome of a separate investigation by the U.S. District Court for Central Illinois concerning sales of replacement parts “will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity."

Caterpillar (CAT +4.5%) shares enjoy their best day in two years after reporting better than expected Q4 earnings and above consensus guidance.CAT warns that 2016 will be another difficult year which "does not anticipate improvement in world economic growth or commodity prices," but says its cost management and restructuring actions are helping; CAT's Q4 operating costs fell 15% Y/Y.CAT foresees FY 2016 earnings of $4/share, excluding restructuring costs, compared with the average estimate of $3.48/share and 2015 EPS of $4.64; 2016 revenue is expected to fall by ~10% from 2015 to ~$42B, which would be the lowest level since 2010 and more than one-third below the company’s peak of $65.9B in 2012.However, Dundee Capital’s Maxim Sytchev is "not buying" CAT’s above consensus earnings guidance, saying CAT's EPS outlook includes a $0.50 pick-up from a change in accounting principles related to pension and other costs - not a repeatable event - and noting that the latest rolling three-month retail sales have been grinding down at a 16% clip, even worse than the prior period's 11% decline.

Caterpillar drops after saying dividend is safe
Caterpillar (CAT -1.7%) extends its losses after saying it would maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.77/share; shares were bouncing slightly above and below the flatline before the announcement."Paying a dividend in times of business and economic uncertainty and throughout business cycles is a priority for use of our cash," CEO Doug Oberhelman said about an hour ago.There has been some speculation that CAT might cut its dividend to help free cash flow and liquidity amid falling commodities prices and an uncertain global economy.

Goldman remains bearish on Joy Global, Caterpillar
Joy Global (NYSE:JOY) is maintained with a Sell rating with a reduced $8 stock price target, cut from $14, at Goldman Sachs, which explains that even though Joy shares have been weak for two years, it is important to keep in mind that the base metals deflation cycle remains in the early stages, coal is "structurally" losing share to natural gas and alternative energy sources, and Joy's tangible book value of $900M is higher than the stock's $1.4B market cap.Goldman maintains a Neutral rating on Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) with a price target lowered to $67 from a previous $72, given the company's competitive position within the challenging end market; however, CAT could benefit in 2017 as U.S. shale capex profiles begin recovering.

Citi: 28 U.S. value names for 2016
It's been a rough run for value stocks over the past few years, but the metric used to determine value - price/book - may not be the right one, says Citi's Robert Buckland. Free-cash-flow yield is better, he argues. noting this metric tracked traditional value in the 1990s and 2000s, but has easily outperformed over the past decade.It's a sign of the times, he says, as FCF is a "capex-suspicious metric," and investors are concerned about the economic outlook, and cynical about capital allocation decisions of managements.The list of 28 U.S. value (as defined by FCF yield) plays: BHI, VIAB, WFM, ANTM, HPQ, ABC, LBTYA, M, AAPL, CTL, XRX, LYB, CMI, ETN, MRK, VLO, CSCO, WRK, IBM, LVS, ESRX, IP, CAH, ADM, INTC, CAT, ABBV, EMN Dec. 8, 2015, 3:18 PM | 49 Comments
Caterpillar posts 35th straight monthly decline in global retail sales
Caterpillar (CAT -1.2%) is lower after disclosing a 16% decline in its monthly worldwide machine retail sales for October vs. an 11% drop in September.CAT's sales have now fallen for 35 consecutive months, with October's 16% drop ranking as the largest drop during the streak and the biggest monthly decline since February 2010.Sales fell vs. the prior-year period in each of CAT's four global regions and three main industries, with the worst slowdowns in construction sales in Latin America (-41% in October) and in resources industry sales in Asia (-37%)."The global mining and construction business has been in a funk due to the crash in commodity prices, the slowdown in China, and the strong dollar, and the monthly machinery sales totals from Caterpillar really put these declines into perspective," Bespoke writes.Axiom Capital reiterates its Sell rating and $28 year-end 2016 price target on the shares.

Caterpillar: Lower Chinese demand will limit sales
Seeing some serious headwinds ahead, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is warning that it doesn't expect Chinese demand for excavators to return to the highs hit several years ago."That shows how far off the peak we are," Caterpillar's Tom Pellette told the FT. "For China specifically, our expectation is that the market will rebound but we are not planning [for it to] get back to 2011/2012 levels."The remarks are significant as the group is often dubbed a global bellwether, with its sales giving investors insights into the state of economies across the globe.

Steel stocks mostly lower after U.S. sets preliminary import duties
The U.S. set preliminary import duties on corrosion-resistant steel products from China, India, Italy and South Korea, but they are not nearly as heavy as many observers had expected, and steel company stocks (NYSEARCA:SLX) initially fell after the announcement at ~3:00.While the preliminary duties on China are high, as expected, duties on Korea and Italy were "much smaller than expected," while there were no duties for Taiwan, which industry followers consider “disappointing," according to Axiom Capital's Gordon Johnson.Axiom sees the news as a slight loss for U.S. steel industry participants, as it suggests incremental duties on outstanding trade cases will focus on China, with little emphasis on other countries China can easily use as an intermediary to get steel into the U.S.X +0.6% in regular trading but -8.1% AH; AKS -2.9% in regular trading and -2.4% AH.Also, in regular trading: CLF +7.3%, JOY +0.7%, CAT +0.5%, NUE -0.3%, CMC -0.4%, RS -1.8%.

Tough day for four wheelers
Select vehicle stocks are weaker after Paccar (PCAR -5.9%) fell short of revenue estimates with Q3 earnings and Cummins (CMI -8.5%) warned on demand trends in Brazil and China.Paccar reported deliveries to the U.S. and Canada were up 3% during the quarter. New truck deliveries to Europe increased 11%.

Caterpillar shifts focus to loyalty with recovery seen at least a year away
Seeing any upturn in sales or earnings still at least a year away, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) says it is shifting its focus to loyalty in the hope that helping end users do more with less will help it sell more replacement parts and win loyalty for the long term."It’s very important to us to have machines out in the dirt working," CFO Brad Halverson tells Bloomberg. “To have a field population that generates parts and service is good for our dealers, ourselves and our customers in terms of providing a lower owner operating cost.”While it might seem counter-intuitive for a company to effectively help its customers buy less of its products, it is part of CAT’s strategy for the downturn, says resource industries group head Edward Rapp.The strategy is not going to be much of a moneymaker for CAT in the short run, Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann says, "but it makes people think, 'Cat’s got my best interests in mind.'"

Caterpillar +2% despite cuts to 2015 profit outlook, 2016 sales
Caterpillar (CAT +2.1%) is higher even after posting disappointing Q3 results and lowering its 2015 earnings guidance, as investors seem to decide the results weren't as bad as they looked.Citi says CAT's earnings quality was better than the headline number suggests, as the operating segments combined to top its estimate by $0.05/share, including better than expected results in both Construction Industries and Energy and Transportation."The results were in line with the pre-announcement and not worse," according to Longbow Research.Not all observers are so sanguine, as Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann senses "a weak feel to everything here," as CAT’s E&T segment “is carrying the load here, and the concern is how long that can last.” Oct. 22, 2015, 2:49 PM | 6 Comments

Recent rally in Caterpillar, Joy Global likely too good to last, Citi says
Citigroup questions the sustainability of the recent rally for some machinery stocks, saying its cautious view on the global economy and downbeat near-term outlook for most commodities make it wary on the more China/commodity-levered names such as Caterpillar (CAT +1.8%) and Joy Global (JOY +10.9%).Citi says short-covering does not appear to have played a major role in the recent rally, at least relative to other heavily-shorted sectors; the firm senses conviction levels have been growing on the short side in recent weeks for JOY, Oshkosh (OSK +2.3%) and United Rentals (URI +3.4%), and historical seasonal patterns argue against being too bearish against Deere (DE +2.2%).In light of bearish investor positioning, the firm favors Buy-rated URI, OSK and Eaton (ETN +1.6%).

Shorts pile into Caterpillar
With Caterpillar's (CAT -1.8%) stock back to 2010 prices, shorts have risen to levels not seen since 2009, according to Markit and Bloomberg, with roughly 7% of the company's shares, or $2.7B, sold short.At the start of this year, the short ratio was closer to 2%.Working for the shorts are fundamentals, but working against them is the loyalty of CAT shareholders, a $10B buyback authorization through 2018 (of which, $3B has already been used), and a dividend which has been raised six times since 2009 (the stock now yields nearly 5%).That dividend costs nearly $2B per year and free cash flow to equity was $4.5B in the 12 months ended June 30. It seems like plenty of coverage, but $4.5B is down 38% from the prior period and the lowest amount since 2011. More sizable drops could put the dividend in jeopardy.

Glencore leads broad selloff in commodities firms, miners, even banks
It isn't just Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF, OTCPK:GLNCY) who is tanking, as at least one measure of raw materials producers plunges to seven-year lows following the company's woes and data that showed weakening Chinese industrial profits.Shares of Glencore plunged 29% to close at just 69 pence, an all-time low, exaggerated by a damning report that said future earnings are so uncertain that the company may need to direct all of its efforts to repay debt.Freeport McMoRan (FCX -10.2%) is hit hard after breaking below support at $10/share, and global mining peers Rio Tinto (RIO -4.1%), BHP Billiton (BHP -4.5%) and Vale (VALE -9.4%) also are smacked down.A number of other firms also are in situations not that much different from Glencore, says DTN analyst Darin Newsom, noting that Caterpillar (CAT -2.2%) and Deere (DE -1.6%) have been struggling and adding that pressure on Glencore may “create a vacuum those other struggling companies could get sucked into."Along with oil and gas producers and precious metals miners, even financial stocks are affected, with Morgan Stanley (MS -3.6%) and Goldman Sachs (GS -3.4%) underperforming their banking peers, perhaps as investors grow nervous about the potential for any of Glencore's problems possibly blowing back on other commodity trading operations.

"Too many headwinds to ignore" at Caterpillar, William Blair says
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform with a $60 price target, slashed from $90, at William Blair following yesterday's guidance cuts and planned workforce reduction.The firm cites "too many headwinds to ignore" - including North America locomotives; oil, gas and other commodity investments; and emerging market weakness such as Brazil and China - that likely will spill over into at least next year, adding that even in the U.S., a market that typically has been a source of strength, weakness in the ABI is troubling, with no recovery in oil and gas in sight.Blair says there are no clear major catalysts that could provide any sort of positive momentum for CAT other than an acceleration in the global economy, for which there is currently "no visibility."In the wake of CAT's woes, analysts Barclays and Raymond James advise investors to stay away from CAT and most of the overall machinery sector.Earlier: Barclays begins U.S. machinery sector with negative view Sep. 25, 2015, 5:55 PM | 17 Comments

Axiom Capital's well-timed Sell recommendation on Caterpillar
"After our scrub of the financials, as well as roughly $9B of failed acquisitions in the past four years (one of which was later rendered a fraud), 2 business segments that we believe are in a state of structural decline, and one that appears to be rolling over at present, we see forward EPS revision risk as high," says Axiom's Capital Gordon Johnson, initiating Caterpillar (CAT -6.5%) with a Sell rating (his note being released this morning ahead of CAT's guidance cut and restructuring plans).Johnson's price target of $28 by year-end 2017 is a whopping 60% below where the stock closed at last night.Also noted by Johnson is the SEC's focus on CAT's intercompany dealings via Caterpillar Financial - it's likely to weigh on the company's ability to use leverage to fund sales between itself and wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries for which there is no known end-buyer (less-politely known as channel stuffing)."Adding it all up, we see earnings risk that is not fully understood by those who currently hold the stock."

Trump's Caterpillar rant could resonate with activist investors
Love him or hate him, Donald Trump is right about one thing: Caterpillar (CAT +0.9%), which the presidential candidate uses as an example that the U.S. is lagging behind other nations in growth and trade, is not doing so well."With terrible end markets, Caterpillar’s management is somewhat limited in its actions on that front,” Morningstar's Kwame Webb tells Bloomberg, but "there does seem to be a feeling that management probably could be doing more and be a little more proactive."Webb thinks CAT could further tighten its belt on the manufacturing side, adding that an activist may decide to focus on sprucing up its operations: “I could probably see somebody wanting to help them revisit their capital allocation in terms of investment priorities and figuring out which markets are appropriate to chase.”Bloomberg's Joel Levington notes that CAT's inventory days are at the highest level since 2013, when the ratio reached a more than 15-year high.

Caterpillar jumps at the open, Barron's says will snap back
Caterpillar (CAT +3.3%) shoots higher in early trading following a Barron's weekend article that says the company has used the mining and oil drilling downturns to prepare for a rebound that could begin next year, and send shares should have an "excellent chance" of returning 20% over the next year.CAT’s goal during downturns is to limit the decline in operating profit to 30% of the decline in revenue, and the company is surpassing the goal after falling short in past cycles, according to the report.CAT's net debt is just $3B, and last year the company generated $4.5B in free cash flow; this year it could produce $4B for a free cash yield of 8.6%, and the strong financial position affords plenty of flexibility.

Caterpillar resists calls for deeper spending cuts in "stagnant" world economy
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) fell 3.5% in today's trade after cutting revenue guidance for the year during its Q2 earnings report while noting a "relatively stagnant" global economy.With sales running at ~25% below the level of three years ago, analysts in today's earnings call asked CEO Doug Oberhelman if he thought deeper cost cuts are needed; while the CEO promised to slash spending if the global economy gets much worse, he said CAT wants to retain enough capacity so it can be ready to take advantage of an eventual recovery.Oberhelman tries to see the bright side of things: Companies continue to reduce spending on equipment, maintenance and even spare parts, so CAT's mining "trucks and ancillary equipment are being used longer and longer and longer," meaning the miners will have to buy new trucks at some point.Sales will heavily depend on what happens to the global economy, but CFO Brad Halverson says if  CAT's forecast of lower H2 sales proves accurate, it would be the first time since the 1930s the company has suffered three straight years of decline.Wells Fargo keeps its Market Perform rating on CAT while saying the demand trends indicated by the company may have a negative implications for Cummins (NYSE:CMI), Terex (NYSE:TEX) and Deere (NYSE:DE).

BHP guidance disappoints, Citi says
Citigroup analysts say BHP Billiton's (BHP -3.4%) FY 2016 guidance for declines in production of oil, coking coal and copper were larger than expected, and the guidance for increased iron ore production was also below expectations.While declines were expected due to field decline in oil and lower grades in copper, "it highlights the capital intensive nature of mining and that even $9B of capex does not drive production growth every year," CIti says, as it forecasts copper equivalent production growth of 2% in FY 2017."The beauty of diversification is that when one commodity is down, one of the others picks up the slack. That's not happening right now for BHP," says a mining analyst for Morgans Financial.Miners and related companies are hammered in early trading: CLF -13%, RIO -1.9%, VALE -2.5%, FCX -3.1%, OTCPK:AAUKY -3.9%, CAT -2.7%, JOY -1.2%.

Caterpillar to lay off more workers due to mining sector slump
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) says it will lay off another 50 workers at its East Peoria, Ill., manufacturing hub because of the downturn in demand for mining equipment, bringing to 270 the number of workers it has said it will lay off this year at the site.Last week, CAT said it would idle 120 employees from the location, adding to 100 layoffs announced in January.The layoffs affect workers represented by the United Auto Workers and are expected to take effect on June 29.

Caterpillar worth buying thanks to the "CAT Trinity," Stifel says
Caterpillar (CAT -0.1%) benefits from a weakening U.S. dollar, a further recovery in U.S. non-residential construction and an improving global GDP environment - or the "CAT Trinity" - Stifel analysts say in reiterating its Buy rating.The firm's three main reasons to buy the shares had been headwinds for the stock from mid-2014 to early 2015, but "a tailwind could be in the making for the 'CAT Trinity' as well as CAT shares," with the Fed now communicating a slower pace of rate hikes and signs of strengthening overseas GDP.Stifel’s bullish call comes just a day after Oppenheimer recommended buying machinery stocks, including CAT.

Time to buy Caterpillar and other machinery stocks, Oppenheimer says
The time is right to buy machinery stocks such as Caterpillar (CAT +0.2%) and Deere (DE +0.4%), Oppenheimer analysts say, as high-level macro drivers for the industry have begun to show signs of improvement after a challenging start to 2015.The firm believes a potential stabilization in hard commodity prices, a rebound in U.S. economic surprises and a possible trough in the same for China are keys underpinning a more constructive global macro backdrop, and serve as key catalysts for improved industry fundamentals in a heavily overseas reliant industry.In addition to CAT and DE, the firm is favorable toward Paccar (PCAR +1.7%), Ingersoll-Rand (IR +0.6%), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK +0.9%), Wabtec (WAB +0.3%), Snap-On (SNA +1.1%) and Oshkosh (OSK -0.6%).

Caterpillar's exec pay plans put to the test
Caterpillar (CAT +1.3%), which has drawn attention for tampering with financial targets it uses to help set executives' bonuses, will see its executive pay plans put to a shareholder test today.Proxy advisory firm ISS and CtW Investment Group, a union-backed investment fund, have urged shareholders to vote against the compensation package.The so-called say-on-pay vote isn’t binding, but it could prove significant as low levels of support on such a vote - typically anything below 70% - can draw closer scrutiny from proxy advisers or prompt boards to court investors to head off greater dissent.Update: Shareholders have voted in favor of the plan, with preliminary results showing 66% supporting the package.

Caterpillar recommended as a Buy at Societe Generale
Caterpillar (CAT -0.1%) is initiated with a Buy rating and $110 price target at Societe Generale, implying a 25%-plus gain after tumbling 17% over the past year thanks in part to the decline in oil and gas demand.While oil and gas sales are likely to decline further, the firm sees signs of recovery in other key end markets that could prove a catalyst for CAT; in such a scenario, H2 2016 and 2017 could improve as the mining aftermarket begins to normalize with the start of some replacement of a worn-out fleet and inventory destocking headwinds subside.The firm also cites a valuation below previous downturn norms and the negative sell-side consensus as factors supporting its positive view on CAT.

S&P's Gibbs endorses view that Caterpillar, Joy Global have bottomed
S&P Capital IQ chief investment officer Erin Gibbs agrees that the worst is over for commodities and that the mining equipment business is stabilizing, seconding the view offered yesterday by Baird analysts in an upgrade of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Joy Global (NYSE:JOY).Both companies reported "rather dismal" Q1 earnings and warned that the next couple of quarters could be even worse, Gibbs told CNBC today, "but clearly investors are looking much farther ahead, and they're looking at 2016, which actually has really great [expected] growth going forward."Looking at JOY, Gibbs says the stock is trading at a good valuation, is below its one-year average P-E ratio, and sports a healthy dividend.After meeting with CAT management, Citi's Timothy Thein raises his stock price target to $90 from $85 after coming away with a better appreciation for potential upside from internal cost-saving initiatives.

Caterpillar, Joy Global rise on Baird upgrade
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been upgraded at Baird on the belief that the stock may have bottomed as the worst of the mining and commodity deflation cycle appears to have passed.Analyst Mig Dobre raised his rating to outperform from neutral, and boosted his stock price target to $101 from $80.Dobre feels the decline in commodity prices over the last several years has been on par with the 1980's bust, and that anything worse would resemble the cycle seen during the Great Depression, which would be unlikely given the significant stimulus from central banks around the world.Caterpillar's stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in each of the past four years through 2014, although it has never underperformed the broader market for five-straight years.Dobre also upgraded Joy Global (NYSE:JOY) to outperform from neutral, and raised the stock price target to $62 from $45.CAT +0.8%, JOY +0.8% premarket May 11, 2015, 8:23 AM | 1 Comment
First Solar halted; Q2 guidance strong, Caterpillar deal announced
Though it missed Q1 estimates, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is guiding for Q2 revenue of $750M-$850M and EPS of $0.45-$0.55 vs. a consensus of $779.7M and $0.40.The company also announces it's partnering with construction machinery giant Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to provide integrated solar systems for microgrids in places where reliable grid electricity is lacking. CAT +0.7% AH to $87.50.First Solar will "design and manufacture a pre-engineered turnkey package for use in remote microgrid applications, such as small communities and mine sites," and also manufacture Caterpillar-branded panels. Caterpillar will act as the exclusive seller of the solution, which will be paired with related generator sets and energy storage hardware.Q1 sales weakness is blamed on the retaining of projects meant for First Solar/SunPower's YieldCo JV, as well as on multiple project delays and a higher mix of module-only sales.Potential bookings opportunities rose by 500MW Q/Q to 14GW, and expected future systems/3rd-party module revenue by $300M to $7.6B. Expected module shipments rose by 200MW to 3.9GW.

Caterpillar maintained Buy at Stifel as construction recovery not far off
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is maintained with a Buy rating at Stifel following Q1 results, believing that buybacks, a healthy dividend, and North American construction will remain steady while investors await a boost in commodities - a function of the U.S. dollar, and demand in China and emerging markets.The bears are out on CAT, but the firm thinks it is a stretch to expect the current downturn will last much longer than 2016 and believes a recovery in North American heavy construction is in the early stages.Barclays raises its price target to $93 from $90, noting that CAT's Q1 15.8% construction margin was well above its 11.4% estimate; CAT also seems open to more significant cost takeouts, particularly within resource industries, after increasing its planned restructuring costs by $100M in 2015 (Briefing.com).Wolfe Research thinks CAT’s results are bad news for Joy Global (NYSE:JOY), and the firm expects multiple revenue and EPS revisions for JOY through 2015.

Despite expectations of a rebound, there is cause for caution - Scotiabank
"Boeing (NYSE:BA) only reported 39 aircraft orders vs. 72 in February, and the ISM index for March was weak both in terms of its overall reading and its new orders index, which mutes our overall enthusiasm."As well, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) earnings call yesterday didn’t instil a whole lot of confidence, as the CEO emphasized a need to run through inventories and called 2015 an ‘uncertain and challenging year’ not least due to the dropoff in demand for machines from the U.S. energy complex."New orders and shipments of capital goods (non-defense, ex-air) are a proxy for U.S. business capex on machinery and equipment which wends its way into the GDP figures, and it has been weak for the past couple of quarters."Recent comments from industry are at least less-than-encouraging when it comes to hoping for a substantial pick-up in capex overall."

Bloomberg: Halliburton asset sales attracting largest industrial companies
At least a half-dozen major industrial companies - including GE, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Dover (NYSE:DOV), Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) - are said to be weighing offers for oilfield services assets worth $5B-$10B that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is preparing to sell ahead of its pending merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), Bloomberg reports.HAL reportedly will send offering materials to those companies, as well as P-E firms and rival oilfield services providers, in the coming weeks; first up likely will be the drill bits unit and another that uses data to track and steer the direction of drills.These companies could own an edge over oilfield services companies that analysts have pegged as logical bidders for HAL’s castoffs - such as National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Superior Energy Services (NYSE:SPN) - because HAL might not want to give any more market share to companies that already offer the same services, preferring to sell to new players entering the market.

Caterpillar's dividend holding the line before earnings recovery, Stifel says
Caterpillar’s (CAT -0.8%) 3.5% dividend yield will keep CAT shares from falling too much as investors wait for a recovery in U.S. construction, and any further risk to earnings at this point may be offset by multiple expansion as visibility of an EPS trough improves, Stifel analysts say.CAT will continue to feel commodity headwinds, Stifel says while reminding investors that non-energy still totals 60% of CAT's retail demand, so separating the secular from the cyclical is critical; the analysts believe a U.S. heavy construction recovery is in its infancy and would provide a lift to CAT's EPS post 2015.

WSJ: Caterpillar’s tax liability from overseas unit could grow past $1B
Caterpillar's (CAT +1.2%) potential liabilities for additional U.S. taxes and penalties could be much larger than the $1B the company recently disclosed, according to a WSJ report that cites various tax experts.Last week, CAT said the IRS objected to the way it calculated taxes owed on sales of replacement parts for equipment outside the U.S. related to the company’s 1999 creation of a Swiss subsidiary, which has yielded ~$300M/year in tax savings.The IRS has a strong case for "going after" CAT, since the creation of the Swiss unit appeared to have no business purpose other than reducing taxes, according to one tax law professor who testified last year at a Senate hearing on CAT’s tax practices.Lacking sufficient information, Wall Street analysts have not yet adjusted earnings forecasts for potential costs of the tax dispute.

Joy Global worse off than Caterpillar, Axiom analyst says
Jim Chanos' dislike of Caterpillar (CAT -0.8%) stock is well known (I, II) but Axiom Capital's Gordon Johnson wishes that "someone please tell Jim Chanos that Joy Global (JOY -2%) is worse off than Caterpillar."With ~65% of JOY’s sales linked to the sale of equipment for coal mining (with a heavy weighting to the U.S. coal market) vs. less than half this amount for CAT (exacerbated by CAT’s far less direct exposure to the U.S. market), the analyst thinks JOY’s fundamentals stand to suffer significantly more than CAT as several headwinds come to fruition over the next year.Given a once-in-a-decade correction lower in commodity prices, Johnson firmly believes the next 12 months will bring far more than the typical downward seasonality for JOY, as he reiterates his Sell rating and $28 stock price target.

Caterpillar inches higher as J.P. Morgan says further downside is limited
Caterpillar (CAT +0.9%) shares rebound slightly from yesterday’s selloff, as J.P. Morgan upgrades CAT to Neutral from Underweight while seeing limited likelihood of further declines.JPM says its Neutral rating is based on CAT’s exposure to oil and gas, both direct and indirect, which seems to have entered a prolonged period of volatility at best and perhaps a long-term down cycle; the firm cuts its estimate for 2015 earnings to $4.80/share from $6.70, as CAT said yesterday it expects EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $50B for the year.Stifel analysts maintain their Buy rating but cut their price target to $93 from $122, Barclays keeps its Overweight rating but lowers its target to $90 from $101, and UBS cuts its target to $81 from $84 as it expects headwinds from oil and gas to extend into 2016.

Caterpillar's Oberhelman says lower oil price is hurting orders
The oil price decline is the most significant reason Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) expects a 20% cut in its earnings this year, particularly for its energy and transportation unit which makes compressors, pumps and turbines for oil and natural-gas companies, and is a negative for CAT’s construction business in oil-producing regions, CEO Doug Oberhelman said in today's earnings call.A stronger dollar also is hurting sales and will hurt U.S. manufacturers, although CAT's global production footprint would help offset the impact, the CEO said.“We are hopeful the guidance is conservative enough to provide a base level expectation for 2015, but it was a surprise even against lower expectations,” says William Blair analyst Larry De Maria.If 2015 sales fall the company expects, it would be the first time since the Great Depression that CAT has experienced three consecutive years of falling revenues.Earlier: Caterpillar plunges on profit drop, lowered outlook Jan. 27, 2015, 5:57 PM | 3 Comments
Cummins downgraded at First Global, citing weaker emerging markets outlook
Cummins (CMI -3.8%) is downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at First Global despite delivering a respectable performance for the final nine months of 2014.CMI’s industrial engines are highly exposed to the construction and mining industries which are being impacted by weak capital spending in China and other emerging markets, the firm says; also, demand in the Chinese and Brazilian truck markets remains weak.At 13.9x estimated CY 2015 earnings, CMI shares already trade at a moderate premium to peers such as Caterpillar, First Global adds.CMI and other equipment manufacturers are broadly lower following Caterpillar's (CAT -7.2%) disappointing quarter: JOY -5.3%, MTW -5.1%, DE -2.7%, CNHI -1.9%.

Jefferies, Chanos expect disappointing earnings for Caterpillar
Caterpillar (CAT -1.3%) is weak as Jefferies predicts it is among the machinery-related stocks most likely to disappoint investors with Q4 results, and that the company may may cut its 2015 revenue forecast from "flat to slightly up" to "flat to slightly down."Jim Chanos, who is short the stock, reiterated his negative view on CNBC this morning, citing increasing challenges in CAT's energy and mining businesses.He also sees trouble ahead for big multinational energy companies, mentioning in particular Exxon (XOM +1.7%) and Chevron (CVX +1.3%) and expecting substantial cuts to their outlooks.

Energy stocks brace for several ugly quarters to come
Wall Street is bracing for a 20% decline in energy companies’ Q4 earnings, with deeper losses expected later when companies report Q1 and Q2 earnings.Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) on Thursday will be the first among oilfield services companies to report, while other companies, such as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), which reports on Jan. 27, also may report pain from falling oil prices.Among the giant oil companies, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is expected report its Q4 on Jan. 29 with analyst consensus EPS of $0.89 vs. $1.40 a year earlier, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) reports on Jan. 30 and analysts foresee EPS of $1.78 vs. $2.57 a year ago, and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) reports on Feb. 2 and is seen reporting $1.41 vs. $1.91 last year.Perhaps more than earnings numbers, investors will want to hear about belt-tightening measures at energy companies; more than 40 so far have announced their 2015 capex plans, with the average budget calling for a reduction in spending of more than 30%.Expect to hear the term “ex-energy” to describe overall earnings outside energy companies, the same way “ex-financials” was handy a few years back.

Caterpillar -2% after J.P. Morgan downgrade on energy exposure
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) -2% premarket as J.P. Morgan downgrades shares to Underweight from Neutral with an $80 price target, down from $95, citing the machinery maker's direct exposure to oil and gas and indirect exposure to mining, U.S. construction and emerging markets.JPM says CAT's exposure to oil and gas totals $6.5B, or ~12% of total revenue, as it supplies turbines to offshore rigs, as well as reciprocating engines and transmissions for on-site drilling.The firm says U.S. construction equipment demand since 2010 has been strongly correlated with the expansion of fracking, and thus expects to see a slowdown in equipment demand in 2015.

Caterpillar CEO sees oil decline as short-term painful but long-term positive
Caterpillar (CAT +0.7%) CEO Doug Oberhelman tells CNBC that weaker oil and gas prices will create short-term pain for his company in 2015 but not as much as the slowdown in mining during recent years.In fact, lower energy prices may end up helping in the long run, as "the giant stimulus program we've all just been blessed with will work its way through eventually," but uncertainty will rule during the near term.CAT has avoided acquisitions of energy-related companies in recent years because valuations were high, but those deals may now come into play in the next two years, Oberhelman says but notes that CAT does not have a specific target in mind.

Caterpillar will need to guide earnings and sales lower, analyst says
After meeting with Caterpillar’s (CAT -0.7%) management, J.P. Morgan's Ann Duignan thinks the company will have to guide sales lower.The analyst says CEO Doug Oberhelman said that while there are pockets of strength in U.S. construction, lower oil prices are sure to present challenges, and based on his comments, she expects management to guide 2015 revenues to flat at best, and likely flat to down; however, CAT likely is aggressively repurchasing shares given the recent stock performance.JPM remains Neutral on the stock, but lowers its revenue outlook and EPS for 2015 to $6.90 from $7.00 and Wall Street consensus of $7.03 and for 2016 to $7.70 from $7.72 and $7.91 consensus.

Dollar strength is a tailwind for us, Caterpillar CEO says
A stronger dollar is a headwind for many U.S. exporters, but Caterpillar (CAT +0.4%) CEO Doug Oberhelman tells CNBC that greenback strength has given his company a boost.The U.S. dollar hit multi-year highs against several currencies last week, including a seven-year high against the Japanese yen; many U.S. exporters face the risk of losing out to competitors abroad now that their product is more expensive, but Oberhelman says that has not been the case for CAT."We're a big producer in Japan also. In fact in the latest quarter, dollar strength was a little bit of a tailwind for us because we tend to produce and sell in those markets to offset costs and revenue," the CEO says.Oberhelman also dismisses concerns about China's slowing growth trajectory, saying the risks to growth ae "not so scary."

Caterpillar to remain range-bound until end markets improve, analyst says
Caterpillar (CAT -1.5%) climbed 4.6% last week after its Q3 earnings easily beat Wall Street consensus, but Raymond James analyst Theoni Pilarinos thinks this is not the time for investors to chase the stock.CAT deserves credit for right-sizing inventory, bringing production levels in-line with demand, maintaining a solid balance sheet and generating strong cash flow funding $5.4B YTD in share buyback and dividends, but management's forecast for flat 2015 sales growth prompts the firm to lower its numbers accordingly, and Pilarinos believes the stock will be range-bound until end markets improve.AMong other big machinery makers: JOY -3.4%, MTW -1.7%, DE -0.8%.

Caterpillar +5%, Oberhelman upbeat on global growth prospects
Caterpillar (CAT +5%) helps power the Dow higher after crushing Q3 earnings estimates and raising its full-year earnings guidance to $6.50/share.Citigroup’s Timothy Thein says most of the surprise came from operations, not from financial engineering, adding that "given the worsening global macro environment and sharp correction in most commodity markets, investor sentiment was cautious heading in to results.”In his first comments on 2015, CEO Doug Oberhelman said in today's earnings conference call that CAT expects sales to be flat to slightly higher as world economic growth remains slower than the company would like but added there is a "reasonable likelihood" it could improve next year.The CEO says the recent drop in oil prices is a negative for CAT as a major supplier of engines to the industry, but the company would be fine if oil prices are in the mid-80s; much of CAT’s energy-related business is tied to natural gas compression and oil and gas pipelines, which are less affected by crude price fluctuations.

Deere to lay off nearly 10% of workers at Brazil factory
Deere (NYSE:DE) says it is laying off nearly 10% of workers at a factory in southern Brazil as it seeks to cope with falling sales in South America and "the volatility of the Brazilian market."In its latest quarterly earnings release, Deere said it expect sales of agricultural machinery in South America to decline 15% from 201; Brazil is by far the continent's biggest market for such equipment, followed by Argentina.The factory where the layoffs are taking place has ~1,800 workers and produces mechanical harvesters and planters; Deere has four other factories in Brazil.The move could portend trouble for DE's efforts toward becoming one of the top three construction and forestry machinery producers in Brazil by 2018, at the expense of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT).

WSJ: Caterpillar unit loses some railcar repair contracts
Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) Progress Rail subsidiary is losing railcar repair contracts at some of the nation's busiest railroad terminals, including the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, WSJ reports.Rival TTX is taking over railcar inspection and repair work at those ports on Terminal Island, Calif., as well as at rail hubs in San Bernardino, Calif., San Diego, Oakland, Stockton, Calif., and Glendale, Ariz.The switch comes amid a federal grand jury investigation in California, disclosed last year, into whether Progress Rail charged railcar owners for repairs that weren't necessary and improperly disposed of discarded parts.The loss of the contracts likely will hit Progress Rail's revenue, which totaled ~$1.2B when CAT acquired the company in 2006; Progress Rail's service business represents less than 4% of CAT's annual revenue.

Joel Greenblatt diversifies
Joel Greenblatt made investors fortunes at his hedge fund 30 years ago by holding a highly concentrated basket - six to eight names - of deep-value stocks, but his approach today is somewhat different: Buy more than 300 high-quality stocks trading at cheap prices and short more than 300 expensive, lower-quality names. Stocks are weighted in the portfolio depending on where they rank along that spectrum.Greenblatt: "[My partner] and I would wake up some days and lose 15% or 20% of our net worth ... now it's more like 15 or 20 basis points."The strategy is also available in a trio of mutual funds Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management offers, and they now account for more than half of Gotham's $7B in AUM.A top position last year remaining a large holding after a big run higher is Apple, thanks to "huge returns on capital" and 11% earnings yield. As for Apple's future, Greenblatt will leave that for others to debate: "I don't own just Apple. I own a bucket of companies like Apple, and over time, I know my bucket is going to work."Top 5 long holdings now: ENR, SAFM, BG, AXE, CAT.Top 5 short holdings now: SUSS, THC, BOBE, KMT, TMO.

Barron's: Terex poised for growth as big construction projects get underway
Terex (TEX +3.4%) shares could rise up to 30% over the next year, according to a weekend report in Barron’s, which cited four major factors offering strong investment potential.A pickup in big construction jobs - office buildings, hospitals, schools, etc. - which tends to lag behind a home-building recovery by about two years, now seems afoot, which should be good news for TEX and other heavy-metal specialists.TEX is poised to benefit from efficiency moves; years of acquisitions have left it with, for example, more than 70 accounting departments worldwide, a number management says it can reduce to eight.TEX also has amassed a full suite of automated products for stacking and unloading cargo on giant ships - a good business to be in, because the Panama Canal is getting a major capacity increase over the next two years.Finally, TEX shares are cheap, trading at 13.8x this year's earnings forecast vs. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), which trades at 16.4x.

Caterpillar sees little sign of upturn in mining industry
Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) Q2 results sported a 4% Y/Y earnings improvement and the miner raised its 2014 earnings outlook, but sales fell 3% - CAT's 19th straight months of declining Y/Y sales, dating to Oct. 2008.The global mining slump is CAT's no. 1 headwind: Q2 sales to mining customers fell 29% Y/Y, as miners continue to cut back capital spending amid a surplus in commodities production and a drop in prices.The industry remains weak and order levels are still low, but CEO Doug Oberhelman offerd a glimmer of hope in today's earnings call: “The bottom is just behind us. Our numbers are minuscule in terms of ticking up, but they are ticking up.”For CAT to maintain a profit in the face of steadily falling revenue requires constantly finding new ways to boost product prices, cut costs and improve efficiency - all of which CAT has done - but as MarketWatch's Jim Jelter points out, it's only fair to ask how long it can go on, and how CAT's 15% YTD share price is justified.

Caterpillar reports higher quarterly profit; increases profit per share outlook
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) reported higher than expected Q2 earnings as a increase in sales to builders offset a continued slump in the mining sector.Net profit rose to $999M, or $1.57 per share, up from $960M, or $1.45 per share Y/Y.Total sales fell 3% Y/Y to $14.15B from $14.6B primarily due to lower volume in resource industries, partially offset by higher volume in construction industries.The company updated its outlook for 2014 sales and revenues to a range of $54-$56B - a slightly lower mid-point range. The previous outlook was $53.2-$58.8B.Part of the $10B stock repurchase authorization previously approved by the Board of Directors in Q1, Caterpillar intends to repurchase approximately $2.5B of common stock during Q3. $1.7B was repurchased by the company in the first quarter of 2014.Machinery, energy & transportation operating cash flow was $2B for Q2 compared with $3B Y/Y.Q2 earnings Jul. 24, 2014, 8:16 AM

Caterpillar locomotive market share may fall far behind GE
Due to new stricter U.S. locomotive emission standards, freight train manufacturers are facing pressure to update their product lines by January 1. The result of the new legislation may lead Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to fall far behind GE (NYSE:GE) in the race to produce locomotives that comply with the new standards.Caterpillar's famous Electro-Motive Diesel unit announced that its freight trains will not be ready until 2017, paving a clear path for GE to obtain an increased market share.GE is already testing locomotives that conform to the new regulations, and is looking to snatch Caterpillar's customers during its two-year absence from the market. GE already has an estimated 60% to 70% of the domestic freight train market.The concerns don't particularly bother Caterpillar, which expects companies to delay buying new locomotives until the technology is perfected. "History indicates that the railroads are slow to adopt new technology until it is fully proven in the field," says a Caterpillar spokeswoman. Caterpillar will also have overseas sales, which reached $2.5B last year, to make up for the time it will be locked out of the U.S. market. Jul. 14, 2014, 9:15 AM | 12 Comments
J.P. Morgan sees downside risk for Joy Global
J.P.

Boeing -1% as McCarthy calls for letting U.S. Export-Import Bank expire
Boeing (BA) slid 1% today after Kevin McCarthy, the new no. 2 man for the Republicans in the House, said yesterday on the TV talk show circuit that he would not support renewing the charter of the Export-Import Bank.The Depression-era program helps exporters by guaranteeing loans to buyers overseas and providing credit insurance, and has helped finance sales of Boeing Dreamliners to India, Poland and Ethiopia; GE has used the bank to sell trains to Pakistan, and Caterpillar (CAT) relies on the Ex-Im Bank to finance foreign buyers of its heavy equipment.Delta Air Lines (DAL), however, opposes reauthorization of the bank and says taxpayers shouldn’t make it easier for foreign competitors to buy jets.Eric Cantor, who recently lost his primary election and resigned his House leadership post, had supported Ex-Im and helped broker a deal to reauthorize the bank in 2012.

Caterpillar under fire with engine lawsuits
Caterpillar (CAT) is facing at least 15 lawsuits relating to truck and bus engines it sold between 2006 and 2010. The plaintiffs are claiming the engines broke down often, and even in some cases caught fire, although no deaths or injuries have been filed.The company closed its truck and bus engine business for the U.S. market after 2010 due to high costs and small market share.Last year, Caterpillar's engine business accounted for 60% of its $5.63B operating profit.The news comes after Caterpillar's settlement this past Wednesday, when the company payed $46M to settle a lawsuit involving a marine engine that caught on fire in 2009.

Stabilizing mining equipment sales herald better days for Caterpillar, Joy
Fundamentals are stabilizing for mining equipment companies such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Joy Global (JOY) even if the industry isn’t out of the woods yet, Deutsche Bank's Vishal Shah says.A number of leading indicators point to stabilizing mining equipment sales and the absorption of excess capacity: equipment destocking at mines is expected to be completed by year-end and excess capacity for CAT is 10%-15%, dealer inventories are largely normalized, fleet utilization at mining equipment rental company Emeco has bottomed and begun to recover, and bidding activity for operations and maintenance work for contract miners has improved.Shah says JOY should benefit once the cycle turns, but he prefers CAT, which has “a more favorable risk/reward” despite gaining 13% YTD.

Caterpillar boosted by Deutsche ahead of earnings
"Q1 expectations are low due to weather related headwinds and track record of consensus earnings misses in 4 of past 5 quarters," says analyst Vishal Shah. "That said, investor interest in CAT has been increasing over the past 2 months and we expect an inline/modest Q1 beat, positive commentary on construction and signs of recovery in mining to act as a positive catalyst for shares."CAT's mining revenues tend to track those of other mining equipment companies, with about a 2-quarter lag, says Shah's team, which then notes aggregate orders at Joy Global, Atlas Copco, Sandvik, and Outotec were up 5% in Q3. If the lag holds, Caterpillar's mining business should show signs of stabilization in H1.

Shell turning to Asian suppliers, underscoring threat to Caterpillar, Joy Global
Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) says it will use more Chinese equipment at its struggling U.S. shale business, becoming the latest natural resources company to try to reduce costs by switching to cheaper Asian suppliers.
Miners such as Rio Tinto (RIO) and Antofagasta (ANFGF) already are using more Chinese machinery, encouraged by improved reliability which they say can now be integrated into existing operations without compromising efficiency or safety standards.
Shell's shift to lower-cost Chinese manufacturers underscores the potential threat to western industrial equipment makers such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Joy Global (JOY) from their competitors in emerging markets. Apr. 1, 2014, 2:37 PM | 5 Comments
Caterpillar avoided $2.4B in U.S. taxes, Senate report says
Caterpillar (CAT) -1% AH after a new report from Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation, says the company has avoided paying $2.4B in taxes by shifting billions of dollars in profits to a wholly owned Swiss affiliate.The report concludes CAT shifted $8B in profits from its parts manufacturing division in the U.S. to Switzerland; CAT negotiated a tax rate of 4%-6% with Switzerland, whose federal statutory tax rate is typically 8.5%.Levin says CAT is a prime example of a tax-avoidance strategy that costs the U.S. billions of dollars every year, although the subcommittee does not have the authority to conclude whether CAT broke any tax laws.The committee will begin hearings on CAT's offshore tax strategies tomorrow.

Caterpillar CEO: Realignment of China economy to affect sales

Bloomberg: Senate digs into possible Caterpillar tax avoidance

Caterpillar can rise another 25%, Deutsche Bank says in Buy recommendation
Caterpillar’s (CAT) shares have gained 6.7% YTD, more than double their 2013 gain, and Deutsche Bank's Vishal Shah thinks they can move another 25% higher, rating CAT a Buy with a $122 price target.Shah believes investors are overly focused on the decline in CAT's resource industries revenue, which will likely trough earlier than expected in 2014, and are neglecting the significant growth opportunities within the construction segment over the next 3-4 years as well as consistent execution within the power systems segment.The firm eyes a recovery in the overall U.S. machinery sector driven by accelerating global GDP growth; it rates Deere (DE), Cummins (CMI) and Terex (TEX) as Buys but rates Joy Global (JOY), Manitowoc (MTW) and Agco (AGCO) as Holds.

Jim Chanos is still short Caterpillar
Short-seller Jim Chanos says he’s still betting against Caterpillar (CAT) despite the company’s better than expected Q4 results.“The only reason they beat [estimates] was because of two one-time items," Chanos tells WSJ; "The market saw the earnings beat and got excited, but if you look under the surface, we think they missed estimates for operating earnings excluding one-time gains."CAT CEO Doug Oberhelman says demand from mining customers remains weak but should start to recover this year or next; when down cycles end, demand “tends to come back fairly quickly,” he said in today's earnings call.Chanos says CAT's mixed forecasting record should make investors think twice about taking the company’s outlook at face value, pointing investors to last January’s earnings release.

More on Caterpillar Q4: Profit boosted by cost cuts
Caterpillar (CAT): Profit jumped 44% to $1B.The fall in mining sales in 2013 "turned out to be worse than we anticipated," Caterpillar says. As a result, it reduced expenses, and total operating costs dropped 14% to $12.95B in Q4.China sales +20% in 2013 to $3.5B.Machinery & Power Systems (M&PS) enjoyed record operating cash flow of $9B in 2013, helped by $2.9 billion of inventory reduction.Dealers slashed their inventories by over $3B.While these reductions were a headwind last year, Caterpillar believes that "the significant impact" on its sales is "largely over."Caterpillar "sees some signs of improvement in the global economy," which should be positive for sales in the company's construction and power systems businesses. However, it expects mining companies to continue reducing capex and for sales in its resource industries ops to decline modestly.Shares are +7.1%. (PR) (Previous) Jan. 27, 2014, 9:15 AM | 2 Comments

UBS lifts Caterpillar target

Bad news for U.S. makers of construction and mining equipment: China is closing the quality gap.Rio Tinto (RIO) CEO Sam Walsh said earlier this week that his company has been increasing purchases of heavy equipment and other items from China, and has found the quality impressive.Among RIO's purchases were heavy-duty trucks, equipment for loading ships and rail cars that carry ore; "the quality actually was much higher" vs. the traditional supplier, Walsh said. "Instead of spot welds, for example, on the sheet metal they were actually continuous welds."At the best Chinese equipment makers, “it’s incredible the speed at which they are coming up the quality curve," a J.P.

Merrill Lynch unveils its top 10 stocks to buy for 2014
BofA Merrill Lynch is a more cautious buyer of stocks after this year's gains, and its top 10 large-cap stocks to buy for 2014 are mostly under-owned and unloved on Wall Street: ADM, Caterpillar (CAT), CenturyLink (CTL), Citigroup (C), Cisco (CSCO), DaVita (DVA), Exxon (XOM), GM, NextEra Energy (NEE) and Nucor (NUE).On CAT, the Lynch analysts point to high foreign sales prospects for 2014, and see strength in energy-related profits offsetting weakness in global mining; the firm has a $100 price target vs. ~$90 consensus.XOM is considered inexpensive compared to many large-cap energy names, it is expected to continue its large share buyback program and should increase the dividend; Lynch's target is $110 vs. $96 consensus.NUE is the ultimate contrarian play, as Wall Street is underwhelmed by steel stocks, but Lynch sees a rebound in commercial building as a big boost for 2014 earnings; the firm has a $60 target vs. $55 consensus.

Caterpillar (CAT) files its 10-Q.On page 29, the company says its Progress Rail subsidiary "received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California" on October 24.The subpoena is for documents "relating to allegations that Progress Rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts, equipment, tools, and other items."The 10-Q also says Progress Rail "was informed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices."The company is cooperating with authorities, and while CAT notes that "the recent timing of the subpoena" makes it impossible to predict the outcome, the company does not at this time expect a material adverse effect on operating results or financial position.

Caterpillar to close Kilgore mining equipment plant
Caterpillar (CAT) says it will close its Kilgore, Tex., assembly plant in response to falling demand for mining machinery.Lower prices for mined commodities such as iron ore and coal have triggered widespread spending cuts on new equipment; CAT reported Q3 sales of its mining equipment fell 42% Y/Y, and income from mining machinery plunged 63%.CAT already has closed or announced plans to shut small plants in Canada, Minnesota, South Carolina and Virginia.

Reliance on export growth may be miscalculation
HSBC's chief economist Stephen King noticed something peculiar recently when he looked at growth forecasts from the firms' economists: They all cited exports as the engine of growth for the regions they covered."The impossibility of every nation being able to sell more than it buys means some of the analysts must be wrong," Bloomberg notes, pointing to Caterpillar (CAT) and Unilever (UL) as evidence that "the bet on trade is flopping."Further evidence is provided by the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis which recently said global trade volume slid 0.8% in August from +1.8% in July and by recent data which showed China's exports unexpectedly fell in September.Ultimately, "the trade slowdown stems mostly from developing nations, which had powered the world out of its 2009 recession," Bloomberg says. With the IMF cutting its forecast for emerging market growth and the ADB slashing its estimates for developing Asia, choppy waters may lie ahead.Emerging markets: EEM, ADRE, SCHE, GMM, VWO, DEM, EWEM, PXH, PIE, EWX, DGS, EMLB, EDC, EET, EMSA, EDZ, EEV, EUM, TLTE, HILO, EELV, EEMA, EMFT, DVYE, FEMS, EVAL, EGRW, EMCR, IEMG, EMDR, EEME.

JPMorgan cuts Caterpillar to Neutral
JPMorgan cuts Caterpillar (CAT +0.7%) to Neutral from Overweight."What concerns us is the decremental margin in construction of 47% on weak pricing and mix and its guidance of 30% for the company in FY13," analyst Ann Duignan says.She continues: "In our view, costs are not coming out fast enough, particularly in Resource, which will likely remain a headwind in FY14. Additionally, oil prices are trending down, a new risk to Power Systems into 2014 which is by far its most profitable segment."Price target cut to $90 from $105.On the CC, Duignan pushed management pretty hard regarding the 25% pull through: "I mean we still missed the goal... which you’ve been pretty adamant you were going to meet, and we missed it by a longshot this quarter. Should we take away from that that you’re just not moving fast enough?" Here's CEO Doug Oberhelman responding: "Losing 11B off the top-line in a year is pretty [and] we’ve taken a lot of cost out of it to help that but it’s just happened pretty quick. But my expectation hasn’t changed, I will tell you that." (transcript) Oct. 24, 2013, 11:31 AM | 1 Comment

Caterpillar misses, cuts guidance
Caterpillar (CAT) sinks 3.6% before the bell as its Q3 report misses on both lines.Revenue falls 18% Y/Y, while EPS tumbles 43%.Tuesday's September retail machinery sales numbers (-9% overall) suggested bad news might be around the corner.Outlook: EPS of $5.50 on revenue of $55B versus previous guidance of $6.50/share on $56-58B in sales and against consensus of $6.20/share and $56.46B in revenue. (PR)The commentary is decidedly downbeat. Here's Doug Oberhelman: "This year has proven to be difficult, with expected revenues [down] nearly ... 17% from 2012, with about 75% of the drop from Resource Industries, which is principally mining. Not only is mining down from 2012, the demand for equipment has been difficult to forecast. Orders for new mining equipment began to drop significantly in mid-2012 and have continued at very low levels." Oct. 23, 2013, 8:00 AM | 6 Comments

U.S. mining equipment makers clash with U.S. miners over Australia project
Caterpillar (CAT) says the U.S. mining equipment industry faces more than $500M in potential lost sales if U.S. miners succeed in opposing $650M in government-backed financing for the Roy Hill iron ore project in Australia, FT reports.Equipment makers, including CAT, support the loan to the $10B mining project in Western Australia, because the resulting orders for trucks and bulldozers would help the struggling industry, but miners, led by Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF), believe the project would hurt U.S. mining interests.CAT suffered a 10% Y/Y drop in global sales in the three months ended in August; rival Joy Global (JOY), another likely supplier to the Roy Hill project, saw a 36% drop in Q3 orders and has sharply cut its revenue forecast for the coming year.The miners argue that the 55M metric tons of annual production from Roy Hill set to come online in late 2015 would contribute to a global oversupply, putting pressure on iron ore prices.

Deep value hedge-funder shares long-short picks
Deep-value investor Daniel Khoshaba's KSA Capital Partners (now renamed KSA MidOcean) has delivered an annual return of 10.1% after fees since inception in 2004 - trouncing its competition and the S&P 500. He walked between raindrops in 2008, gaining 3.6% while the S&P lost 37%, but just 27% long exposure to the market this year has the fund lagging by nearly 5%. Three current favorites are Owens-Illinois (OI), Dana Holding (DAN), and Pinnacle Entertainment (PNK).The world's largest maker of glass containers, Owens is in the sweet spot of being able to raise prices. With the extra cash, it's paying down debt and eventually will begin buying back stock.Despite nearly doubling in the past 2 years, auto-parts maker Dana still trades at just 4x free cash flow and far below Khoshaba's price target of $38. The company recently announced plans to buy back about 30% of its stock.A newish holding, Pinnacle was added to the portfolio after agreeing to buy rival casino Ameristar. The cost savings should allow Pinnacle to generate a 15% free-cash-flow yield in 2014 - well above Khoshaba's threshold of 10%. His price target is $40.While not disclosing whether he's covered successful shorts in Timken (TKR) and Caterpillar (CAT), Khoshaba recently told investors recovery is unlikely for the companies because they depend on commodities where "production far outstrips demand." He's short BHP Billiton (BHP, BBL) for similar reasons. Sep. 28, 2013, 9:00 AM | 4 Comments

Chanos remains bearish on China and those that supply it
Don't draw any conclusions against the sale of his entire stake in JPMorgan (JPM), Jim Chanos tells Bloomberg. It was a hedge against his shorting of a number of Chinese banks (ETF: CHIX). He reminds he's still long Citigroup (C) against the Chinese shorts. "Our business is still shorting ... China has been a bright spot."Having said that, Chanos is finding himself enamored of a tech stock he originally purchased as a hedge: Samsung (SSNLF.PK, SSNGY.OB).Back in China, Chanos says the country's credit system has "gone crazy" - new debt is growing at 30-40% of GDP per year vs. about 10% nominal GDP growth (and Chanos doesn't buy the GDP numbers). Other than Chinese banks, Chanos remains short CAT along with a number of others which benefitted from the global materials boom. Two names he mentions are Australia's Fortescue (FSUMF.PK) and VALE.China ETFs: FXI, GXC, PGJ, YAO, FCHI, PEK, CAF, YXI, XPP, FXP, MCHI, YINN, YANG, TCHI, CHXF, KFYP.

Miner cost cutting to continue, Cowen Says
Big miners are rallying today as China’s economy shows signs of life but Cowen analysts warn it would be foolish for investors to assume that commodity prices will soar back to their previous levels, if only because mining companies have been cutting costs as if they expect prices will stay low.The rush to cut costs has been felt the hardest by mining-industry suppliers, including Caterpillar (CAT -0.1%) and Joy Global (JOY +0.9%), Cowen says, because cancelling orders for new equipment is one of the easiest ways to cut costs.Among S&P 500 mining stocks, FCX +2.9%, CNX +2.6%, NEM -0.2%.

Ship engine loans are Caterpillar weak spot
Caterpillar (CAT) has been forced to accept delayed payments or ease terms on many of the loans and leases it made to buyers of its marine engines in Europe, blaming a glut of commercial vessels and low cargo rates due to Europe's sluggish economy.CAT's 10-Q filing last week revealed $436M of "impaired" loans and leases in its power-systems segment, up 52% Y/Y, concentrated among marine-engine customers in Europe.Overall, CAT says its financing arm continues to "perform well" - its allowance for credit losses was $422M, or 1.46% of net finance receivables, as of June 30, vs. $393M, or 1.47%, a year earlier.

Caterpillar (CAT -1.7%) slips after saying that global sales of machinery, such as excavators and bulldozers, were down 1% from a year earlier for the three months ended December 31, while engine sales declined 2%, hurt by weaker demand in Asia and North America. The decline was the first since April, 2010, and stands in stark contrast to yesterdays survey results showing that loans and leases for business equipment in the U.S. rose in December.

Jan. 25, 2013, 3:21 PM | 5 Comments
The most recent survey shows that loans and leases for business equipment in the U.S. rose 6% in December from a year ago, as companies staged their usual year-end rush to complete purchases. Financing on new equipment hit a record $11.5B last month, up from $10.8B a year ago. For the year, business volume rose 14% over 2011 to $84.4B. December is typically the busiest month of the year for financing, as companies complete budgeted purchasing programs, but this year was undoubtedly boosted by concerns over potential changes to federal tax depreciation rates under the looming fiscal cliff threat.
