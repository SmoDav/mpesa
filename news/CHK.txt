Nat gas futures fall again, now -25% YTD in oversupplied market
Natural gas futures tumbled 3.45% today to $2.938/MMBtu, extending YTD losses to 25% and extending the downturn among shares of gas production companies that rank among this year's worst performers.Nat gas was one of last year's most profitable trades, as investors bet last year that new gas-fired power plants and record high exports would help burn off excess supply, but a historic level of exports has not been enough to overcome weaker demand during a relatively mild winter and massive new supplies from fracking.Australia and the Middle East put so much gas on the market that it leaves little room for more U.S. export terminals that could help erase the domestic glut, says Robin Wehbé, portfolio director at Boston Company Asset Management."Investors right now across the board just hate natural gas," admits Simmons analyst Pearce Hammond, but he also notes that many U.S. exporters have long-term contracts guaranteeing buyers for their gas.In today's trade: LNG -3.4%, SWN -2.9%, COG -2.4%, RRC -2.2%, AR -2.2%, NGL -2%, CHK -1.7%, APU -1.3%, EQT -0.8%, RICE -0.3%.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, GASX, DCNG Yesterday, 6:22 PM | 63 Comments
Two Chesapeake directors bought $12M in shares this month
Two Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.8%) directors recently bought nearly $12M in shares on the open market, as the company's stock has dropped 21% in the past month.Chairman Emeritus Archie Dunham last week bought ~500K shares for $2.6M, or $5.24 each on average, after paying more than $11.4M for 1.85M shares since August; he now owns more than 4.6M shares, far more than anyone else.Director Thomas Ryan has bought 100K more CHK shares for ~$550K, most recently purchasing 50K shares on March 3, and now owns 314K shares.Dunham and Ryan are the only CHK insiders to buy the stock in 2016 and so far this year, and they have been punished for their optimism; Dunham’s recent purchases are in the red by more than $1.5M through Monday’s close, and Ryan has lost more than $500K on shares purchased since August.

Energy share losses push ETF below 200-day MA as crude oil sinks
Widespread losses in energy stocks today pushed the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE) below its 200-day moving average for the first time since April.The XLE slumped 2.6% in today's trade as 32 of the 37 ETF members fell, with some of the worst losses from MRO -8.6%, MUR -6.7%, DVN -6.5%, CHK -6.1% and NBL -5%; also XOM -1.7%, CVX -1.9%, COP -3.8%.Among other energy movers included: SLCA -8.3%, RSPP -5.2%, CXO -5.2%, PXD -5%, EOG -4.7%, FANG -4.6%, SLB -2.3%.Refiners fared relatively well: VLO +1.9%, MPC +0.1%, TSO +0.3%, PSX -0.3%.Crude oil slumped more than 5% to the lowest close this year after data showed production cuts from OPEC and other producers have not been enough to reduce U.S. supplies.Today's plunge puts oil on a path to test the December low of $49.95/bbl, Again Capital founding partner John Kilduff tells CNBC, with all the pieces in place for crude oil to break below its three-month range: lack of cohesion among OPEC members, bearish statements from oil ministers at the CERAWeek conference, and subdued refinery activity.Other ETFs: VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, FCG, ERY, GASL, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, FENY, IEZ, PXE, GASX, PXI, FIF, PXJ, RYE, NDP, GUSH, DRIP, DDG, FXN, CRAK

U.S. nat gas could create another wave in world markets, Birol says
The U.S. could become an even bigger producer of natural gas and prove a game changer for the U.S. and globally if Pres. Trump's push for pipeline development succeeds and gas is brought to new markets, IEA executive director Fatih Birol tells the CERAWeek energy conference."It could bring the cost down in the U.S. and give a big boost to industry. It can provide attractive alternatives to coal in Asia. It could provide a very attractive alternative to Russian pipeline gas in Europe. It may change the gas prospects in the U.S. and, more importantly, the world," Birol says.The U.S. already is an exporter of natural gas with Cheniere Energy's (LNG -0.5%) liquefied natural gas shipments out of the Sabine Pass in Louisiana, and with pipeline gas shipments to Mexico.Exxon Mobil's (XOM -0.7%) $20B spending program for the U.S. Gulf coast includes 11 projects that will create new demand for gas.Chesapeake Energy (CHK -0.7%) CEO Robert Lawler says his company has brought down costs and raised production, and wells that had produced 10M cf/day of gas before 2011 are now producing up to 40M cf/day or more.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, GASX, DCNG Tue, Mar. 7, 11:37 AM | 67 Comments

Chesapeake Energy files to delay Form 10-K

Chesapeake Energy CDS spreads blowing out
Credit default swaps on Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) debt are the most expensive they've been in a year, according to a source, and the most expensive since August 2015 if one excludes the "extreme fear" period of Sept 2015-Jan 2016.Volume is anemic, but this seems more a function of the sell-side not wanting to insure at these levels, rather than the buy-side not wanting to insure.The market is growing uneasy as credit ratios have not improved despite capital raising and a re-sizing of the business.There's also the renewed decline in the stock price (down 16% over last two months, though higher by 2.6% today). The equity button is the company's primary means of "de-stressing," and losing this lever could be trouble.

Chesapeake Energy's latest Haynesville sale hit a "solid" price, analyst says
“Christmas [has come] early" for Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Wunderlich analyst Jason Wangler says of the company's second Haynesville Shale sale for $465M.While CHK had indicated its intention to announce and close a deal for the package in Q1 2017, Wangler suspects the "solid price tag" of more than $7K per net acre likely allowed the company to finalize and announce a deal.CHK announced only a few weeks earlier its first Haynesville sale "at a healthy price, but this deal came in nicely higher and beat most everyone’s expectations on the proceeds from the sales," Wangler says.Combined with CHK's apparent success in working through another tender offer for its debt, Wangler sees CHK's financials improving and remains bullish on the stock with a $10 target.

WSJ: Chesapeake pins rebound on fracking mega-wells that run for miles underground
Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE:CHK) ultimate survival may depend on perfecting a pioneering method of creating supersized wells which drill deeper and wider wells to extract more oil and gas, WSJ reports.CHK's "Prop-a-geddon" program aims to extract fossil fuels for roughly ~75% less than typical wells, thanks to potentially greater economies of scale - and CEO Doug Lawler says it is “absolutely critical to the company.”CHK is currently drilling a well in the Haynesville Shale formation near Shreveport, La., that runs two miles deep and another two miles horizontally, vs. typically wells in the area that extend a bit less than a mile; CHK used 51M pounds of sand to cement the well, which it believes is a world record.“What we’re learning in the Haynesville, we’re testing in the Eagle Ford, we’re going to apply to the Utica,” says Frank Patterson, CHK’s executive VP of exploration and production. “It’s a game changer.” Dec. 16, 2016, 5:58 PM | 32 Comments

Natural gas production from Ohio, home to the Utica shale formation, jumped 13% Y/Y in August even as output fell across the rest of the U.S., including the neighboring Marcellus play in Pennsylvania.Producers are doubling down on Ohio amid speculation that gas flows from the Utica will eventually rival output from the Marcellus, the biggest U.S. shale reservoir; Ohio accounted for ~5% of U.S. gas supply in August, up from less than 2% for the same period in 2014.Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Rice Energy (NYSE:RICE) and Gulfport Energy (NASDAQ:GPOR) drilled most of the new wells in the state, according to Bloomberg.

Chesapeake Energy can double to $11, SunTrust says
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.5%) can double from current levels to $11, SunTrust analysts say, following the company's strong Q3 results that featured higher than expected production and lower costs.SunTrust says CHK has made substantial financial progress in the past year, with the company shoring up its liquidity and leverage, and materially simplifying its balance sheet.The firm believes CHK's leverage is still higher than the peer group average, and it forecasts a $300M cash flow outspend next year, but continued operational efficiencies and lower well costs should further boost returns and likely push cash flow positive in 2018.

Chesapeake Energy surges premarket after surprise Q3 profit
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) +5.6% premarket after reporting a surprise adjusted quarterly profit for the first time in six quarters, thanks to lower costs that helped offset a drop in revenue on reduced production and low commodities prices.CHK's Q3 net loss narrowed to $1.2B, or $1.54/share, from $4.7B, or $7.08/share, in the year-ago quarter; excluding certain non-recurring items, adjusted EPS of $0.09 came in ahead of analyst expectations.Q3 total revenue fell by a third Y/Y to $2.28B, with oil and gas revenue of $1.18B beating the $1.02B consensus, and marketing and other revenue of $1.1B missed expectations of $1.23B.Q3 production sank to 638.1K boe/day from 667K boe/day a year ago; Q3 capex was $412M, down roughly a third from $623M in the year-earlier quarter.CHK expects its exit rate production to grow significantly over the next two years, projecting an exit-to-exit increase in total production from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017 of ~7%, adjusted for asset sales, and a ~15% increase from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018.

Chesapeake Energy upgraded at RBC on lower cost structure
RBC Capital is the latest to jump on the Chesapeake Energy (CHK -3.7%) bandwagon, upgrading shares to Sector Perform from Underperform with an $8 price target, raised from $7, reflecting the company's lower cost structure and improved margin outlook over the next few years.CHK believes its EBITDA will double by 2018 while increasing liquids contribution to more than 30% of production; RBC thinks the outlook is achievable and competitive with top-tier operators, but debt reduction will require strong asset sale execution.The firm sees potential upcoming catalysts including oil growth from Powder River assets, the Mid-Con opportunity, well results from natural gas assets and restructuring of the Eagle ford midstream deal.Shares are sharply lower today despite the upgrade, the most recent of several analyst upgrades and stock price target increases.

Chesapeake cleared for higher-beta portfolio, Susquehanna says
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) is OK for investors to include as “part of a higher-beta portfolio" amid an improving long-term outlook for the company, Susquehanna analysts say as they raise their stock price target to $7 from $6.50.Although CHK will have a significant cash flow outspend next year, Susquehanna says the long-term outlook provided last week suggests the company is on a path towards cash flow neutrality by mid-2018; the firm's latest model suggests CHK can grow ~10% in 2018 with all-in capex of $2.6B and only a ~$200M outspend.The firm expects Increased production combined with lower operating and transportation costs to yield a more than doubling of EBITDA in 2018 vs. the H2 2016 run rate, prompting a drop in net leverage (including working capital deficit) to ~4x from nearly 9x expected exiting this year.

Chesapeake gets praise, upgrades following analyst day
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -2.3%) merits upgrades from BofA Merrill Lynch and Nomura and price target hikes from several more analysts following the company's analyst day, which included news of a CHK)+Shares+Rise+to+Session+Highs+Amid+Analyst+Day%3B+Notes+Recent+Record+Frack+in+Haynesville+Shale/12151390.html" target="_blank">record frack in a Louisiana well."CEO Doug Lawler and CFO Dominic Dell’Osso deserve a lot of credit for a substantive repositioning," Nomura says in its upgrade to Neutral, which includes an improved $7.50 price target as it removes its discount tied to future liquidity and funding; BofA's new price target is $10.CHK said in a presentation that it set a new record for fracking by pumping more than 25K tons of sand down a Louisiana gas well, a process it called "propageddon,” which improved output from the well by 70% over traditional fracking techniques.Additional stock price target hikes come from Jefferies, UBS and Deutsche Bank, with the latter saying, "The asset base has significantly improved its capital efficiency and productivity... that should provide improved visibility in achieving the multi-year targets."UBS raises its target to $6 from $4.25 but maintains a Sell rating, believing CHK's disclosed target of reaching free cash flow neutrality in 2018 is too optimistic.

Chesapeake loan surges as investors seek refinancing protection
Chesapeake Energy's (CHK -2.8%) $1.5B leveraged loan has surged in the secondary market normally reserved for high-yield bonds, aided by a combination of stiff investor protections and rebounding commodity prices, Reuters reports.When CHK tapped the loan market this summer, investors were attracted by a rare feature preventing the debt from being called for two years, and then paying big premiums if the debt was repaid.Over the past two months, the loan has steadily advanced to a bid of 106.5 on Wednesday in the secondary market, alone among liquid trading loans at such high levels.CHK's unique two-year non-call protection is in heavy demand now, as many performing loans are being repriced to cut spreads and make other borrower-friendly adjustments.

Williams-Crestwood to restructure Powder River gas deal with Chesapeake
Joint venture partners Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ) and Crestwood Equity Partners (NYSE:CEQP) announce an agreement with Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) to restructure natural gas gathering and processing services in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin.The companies say the restructured services will replace the current cost-of-service arrangement and improve economics to support a ramp-up in near-term development and production activity and incentivize long-term development across an expanded area of dedication in the region.The restructured terms of service are expected to include minimum annual revenue guarantees that support the transition to a new fixed-fee structure over the next 5-7 years.

Chesapeake Energy seen offering upbeat view at Analyst Day
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +2.9%) will host its first Analyst Day in two years this Thursday, and analysts at Susquehanna raise their price target on the shares to $6.50 from $4.50 ahead of the meeting.Susquehanna says Analyst Day likely will highlight progress on two key fronts - that CHK has sufficient and potentially growing inventory depth, and can continue to improve capital efficiency - which, combined with further asset sales, could pave the way for progress towards cash flow neutrality and addressing longer-term maturities.The firm thinks productivity improvements could be the highlight of Analyst Day, with Haynesville perhaps receiving the most investor attention given its proximity to the Henry Hub market.

Chesapeake price target upped to $8 at Citi, as production poised to grow
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -3.3%) is sharply lower even as Citigroup analysts raise their stock price target to $8 ahead of the company's first analyst day in two years, although they remain concerned about debt levels, particularly if commodity prices retreat.Citi believes production is poised to organically increase from this point forward and is underappreciated by the market, projecting CHK will increase production ~5% in 2017, above its current guidance for a 2%-7% decline, driven by strong well performance in the Haynesville and dry gas Utica shale plays.Based on accelerating activity following the recent capital restructuring, and thus a lower accrued preferred dividend, and a higher outlook for Utica growth, Citi's 2017 EPS/CFPS estimates are nearly unchanged at $0.68 and $2.33 vs. $0.68 and $2.34 previously.

Chesapeake Energy maintained as a Sell at UBS, with debt load still too high
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +1.7%) is higher even as UBS reaffirms its Sell rating on the stock, saying the company’s debt load remains too high.UBS says CHK's liquidity position has improved, principal debt has been reduced by more than $1B YTD, and 2017 debt maturities have been cut by two thirds to $658M, but it believes financial leverage remains "far too high," and the company needs to explain at its upcoming analyst day - its first since May 2014 - how it plans to reduce debt by $2B-$3B over the next few years.UBS says even assuming CHK can achieve $3B of asset sales in 2017-18, the firm estimates it still would have net debt/EBITDA of greater than 4x at year-end 2018 under its price deck and before volumes associated with a deal.

Chesapeake making the right moves, Wunderlich says in affirming Buy rating
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.2%) is reiterated with a Buy rating and $10 price target at Wunderlich, which says CHK is making the right moves to solidify itself in the near term to take advantage of the future.Wunderlich believes "if investors look through the noise and focus on the company, there is ample opportunity" in CHK: The debt and convertible debt issuances will help build a war chest for future redemptions and activity, converting preferred stock to common will further simplify the balance sheet, and the company now has plenty of cash with expected from its divestiture plan.The firm says it likes the moves CHK has made and, given its discounted trading metrics vs. peers, expects shares to outperform as the company continues to excel operationally and financially.

Chesapeake Energy says it has cash to cover debts through 2018
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) says it has amassed more than enough cash to pay bondholders through the end of 2018.CHK says it has closed its $1.25B private placement of unsecured convertible notes that it can convert to shares in 2019 under certain circumstances, and now has $1B in cash on hand in addition to an undrawn revolving credit line.“With the cash proceeds from the convertible note offering, we have taken measures to provide excess liquidity to address the remaining maturities of our debt through 2018, before any incremental proceeds from the potential asset sales that we are currently working,” CEO Doug Lawler says.CHK was one of the biggest gainers in today's session, climbing 6.7%, in part thanks to a sharp rise in crude oil futures.

Short sellers following Icahn out of Chesapeake, analyst says
Short sellers appear to be exiting Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), following Carl Icahn out the door after the activist investor halved his stake in the company last week.S3 Partners analyst Matthew Unterman estimates CHK short interest has dropped as much as 20% since Sept. 19, to $600M from $750M, when Icahn disclosed his reduced holding to the market.As more shares hit lending pools due to Icahn’s long sales, borrow spot rates have hit YTD lows, in contrast to February, when indicative fees hit as high as 50% when the stock price hit its 52-week low of $1.59, Unterman explains."Investors will be watching closely what Icahn’s next move is, as he may be planning on cutting his stake even further now that he has no board representation. And if he does, shorts sellers will realize additional profits," according to Unterman. Sep. 28, 2016, 6:55 PM | 47 Comments
EXCLUSIVE: Somebody just made a big bet on Chesapeake Energy default
With no central clearinghouse for credit default swaps, trades get reported just once a week and the last couple of weeks of data showed action of considerable interest.Normal weekly trading volume in CDS for Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) is about $100M, says a source, but last week someone purchased a full $1B of insurance on Chesapeake. To put that amount in perspective, typically only major countries or the largest financial institutions ever see that sort of trade size.This week's data shows trading volume in CHK CDS has returned to normal.A bear might say someone who knows something is taking advantage of the recent large decline in premium for Chesapeake CDS to place a very large bet on an imminent default.Of course, there's the other side of the trade, and some financial institution (or, more likely a syndicate of them) was happy to sell the insurance. The sale, though, could be for any number of reasons. For one, business at banks is slow, so why not earn some premium. For another, if an institution is already short CHK debt, the sale of CDS helps create income to offset the cost of that short.

S&P downgrades Chesapeake credit to Selective Default
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) fell 3.7% in today's trade after Carl Icahn cut his stake in the company by more than half and S&P Global Ratings downgraded its credit rating to Selective Default from CC.S&P says it views CHK's tender for senior notes due 2020 and 2023 as a distressed transaction because investors received a material discount to par value.S&P's Selective Default designation means that it believes a company has "selectively defaulted on a specific issue or class of obligations, but will continue to meet its payment obligations on other issues or classes of obligations in a timely manner."After a 90% run-up from June 25 to Sept. 12, when shares closed above $8, CHK has since retreated by 18%.

Chesapeake Energy loses appeal in $438M bond dispute
Chesapeake Energy's (CHK +1.6%) effort to avoid paying $438.7M to investors in a bond dispute is rejected by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.The court says the payout is justified because CHK waited too long to tell holders of CHK's 6.775% notes maturing in 2019 about its plan to redeem $1.3B of their debt six years early.Bond trustee Bank of New York Mellon argued that hedge funds and other bondholders were contractually entitled to a special "make-whole" price because of an early redemption.

Chesapeake's hole "too deep to dig out of," FBR says in downgrade

Oklahoma, EPA trim well shut-in plans after earthquake
U.S. and Oklahoma state officials are lowering by 22 the number of injection wells ordered to be shut in at an area where a 5.8-magnitude earthquake occurred on Sept. 3.State officials say the 27 wastewater wells ordered to be shut compared with the shutdown of 37 wastewater injection wells announced within hours of the quake earlier this month, while the EPA ordered the shut-in of five wells in its area of jurisdiction, down from 17 shut-ins it announced earlier this month.The mandatory shut-ins are expected to last at least six months and may become permanent, depending on new data that is collected.PetroQuest Energy (NYSE:PQ) reportedly has been the only publicly traded U.S. company among the operators affected by regulators' orders.Oklahoma's top oil and gas producers include CLR, CHK, DVN, MRO, NFX, XEC and SD.

Chesapeake Energy merits bullish view at SunTrust
SunTrust analysts raise their price target on Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) to $11 from $8, citing what they say are CHK's ability to spend more next year and the company's improved operating efficiencies.The firm says CHK does not get enough credit for its continued improved operational efficiencies that has seen well costs in nearly all six major regions fall materially while results improve; in the Haynesville, for example, CHK has seen reasonably priced long lateral wells with IPs of nearly 40M cfe/day with very low drawdown, among the best economics on natural gas wells in the U.S.CHK appears to have solved its liquidity issues, with less than $660M now due this year and next, SunTrust says.The firm also looks for CHK to announce at least one large asset sale before year's end that should easily push the value of total sales past $2B YTD.

Chesapeake Energy extends surge amid optimistic outlook
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +13.5%) extends its strong run of recent weeks - now up 90% since June 25 - after a presentation earlier today at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference shows CHK is targeting 5%-15% annual production growth for 2016-20 and the ability to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2018.CFO Nick Dell'Osso said the company has reduced its total leverage by 50% since 2012, is looking to increase asset sales in 2016 by another $900M after completing $1.1B YTD, and is targeting a reduction in debt of $2B-$3B.CHK also noted that capex has dropped to $1.3B-$1.8B this year from $14.7B in 2012, and production has remained reasonably flat at 618K-638K boe/day from 648K in 2012 while cash costs have been nearly cut in half to $4.10/bbl from $7.80 and lease operating expenses have tumbled to $0.80/bbl from $2.28.

Oklahoma quake may trigger calls for more limits on wastewater wells
A backlash against fracking in Oklahoma could grow following this weekend's 5.6-magnitude, earthquake as the U.S. Geological Survey examines whether the record-breaking tremor was triggered by the underground disposal of wastewater from oil and gas production.The USGS says it "cannot currently conclude whether or not this particular earthquake was caused by industrial-related, human activities. However, we do know that many earthquakes in Oklahoma have been triggered by wastewater fluid injection.”“They are going to push the industry to come up with some permanent solutions,” says Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research. “It’s hard to believe Oklahoma would move to ban fracking, but I can see where they would say to people that they have to do something else with the wastewater."PetroQuest Energy (PQ -3%) was ordered to shut four of its disposal wells in Oklahoma, and was the only publicly traded U.S. company among the operators affected by state regulators' orders to suspend a total of 37 wastewater disposal wells.Oklahoma's leading oil and gas producers include CLR, CHK, DVN, MRO, NFX, XEC and SD.

Marcellus/Utica shales surprise with near record production
Natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica shales remains surprisingly strong and defying predictions that output would fall, averaging 22.63B cf/day so far in August, up 2% from last month and the most since February’s all-time high of 22.78B cf/day.Even though the number of drilling rigs has declined, new production per rig now averages ~11.4M cf of gas in the Marcellus, up 18% Y/Y, as producers have managed to maintain volumes by tapping inventories of drilled but uncompleted wells and burrowing deeper, longer wells that yield more gas.Production has been strong despite regional prices at ~$1.2757/MMBtu, less than half the price for benchmark gas in Louisiana.Top Marcellus/Utica producers include EQT, RRC, RICE, CVX, CNX, VTG, REXX, XOM, NBL, COG, CHK.

Chesapeake extends recent surge, but credit outlook still looks cloudy
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) surged 6% in today's trade to a three-and-a-half-month high, and adds another +1.4% AH as a director discloses a purchase of 350K shares worth ~$2.1M.CHK has climbed 29% since its Aug. 15 announcement that it was buying back up to $1B worth of debt, and has soared more than 4x since it closed at a 17-year low of $1.59 on Feb. 12.Despite the rallies in the stock and bond prices, GimmeCredit analyst Philip Adams remains negative on CHK’s credit prospects, expecting “additional impairments and a further reduction in asset coverage” of borrowings during Q3.Separately, Moody’s changed its rating outlook to positive on Aug. 15 but left its long-term debt rating at Caa2, which means the debt is “speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk," while S&P still rates CHK's credit at CC, which implies a “substantial risk of default” within six months, with a negative outlook.

Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) agrees to sell its interests in the Barnett shale in north Texas - the birthplace of the shale revolution - to Saddle Barnett Resources.CHK says leaving the gas fields will cut shipping and processing costs by $715M by the end of 2017, eliminate ~$1.9B in long-term pipeline agreements, increase operating income through 2019 by $200M-$300M annually, and increase the PV-10 of its proved reserves by ~$550M.As part of the deal, CHK will pay $334M to Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ) to end their current gathering agreement, projected MVC shortfall payments and fees pertaining to the Barnett Shale assets, with Saddle Resources also expected to pay an unspecified additional sum.CHK also renegotiates its existing cost-of-service gas gathering agreement with WPZ covering the Mid-Continent operating area to a fixed-fee arrangement, which CHK says should reduce its Mid-Continent gas gathering costs by 36%.The Barnett deal includes ~215K net developed and undeveloped acres and ~2,800 operated wells.CHK +5.2% AH, WPZ -0.2%.

Chesapeake "on the verge of turning the corner," Citi says
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) lost 7.4% in the two days following its Q2 earnings report, as investors may have been disappointed by CHK's 8% Q/Q drop in oil production and lower than expected oil mix, no news on strategic initiatives such as asset sales, and a lack of any real improvement in liquidity.But Citigroup analysts raise their price target on CHK to $6, believing the company is “on the verge of turning the corner."The firm highlights that CHK management raised the bar on asset sales with $2B-plus now expected vs. prior guidance of $1.2B-$1.7B, and with 150K net Haynesville acres apparently ready for sale valued at up to $1.25B, as well as a halt in working capital movements, as CHK announced an $81M shift in Q2, far below Q1's $684M movement.Citi also notes that the 2016 capital budget is now seen at the high-end of $1B-$1.5B E&P guidance, as CHK expects to drill 100 more wells and complete 75 more wells than previously planned while keeping 10 rigs through the rest of the year.

Chesapeake Energy slides after missing on Q2 earnings, revenues
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) -4.7% AH after posting a wider than expected Q2 loss, the company's sixth straight quarterly loss, on 47% lower revenue Y/Y.But CHK's production for the quarter averaged 657.1K boe/day, better than expected, and the company raises its full-year production guidance by 3% while anticipating capex to come in at the higher end of its previous outlook of $1.3B-$1.8B; Q2 capital spending fell to $456M from $957M in the year-ago quarter.CHK increases its asset sales target for the year to more than $2B from its previous estimate of $1.2B-$1.7B, and says it expects to sell some of tis acreage in the Haynesville Shale."Financial discipline remains our top priority," CEO Doug Lawler says, as the company says it reduced its debt by more than $1B YTD; CHK had long-term debt of $8.62B at the end of Q2.

Chesapeake, Tom Ward sued by shale owners for alleged conspiracy
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.7%) and former partner Tom Ward are being sued by investors who say the pair conspired to rig bids for drilling rights during the shale boom.The lawsuit brought by Chisholm Partners and its investors, which accuses CHK and Ward of working together to artificially lower prices while Aubrey McClendon led CHK and Ward was CEO at SandRidge Energy, seeks at least $30M in damages.The suit alleges that CHK and  SD between them illegally divided up the geographic area covering the Anadarko Basin Region in Kansas, and other states, and agreed not to compete and drive up prices.

Chesapeake Energy soars after Piper Jaffray upgrade
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +8.6%) surges after Piper Jaffray upgrades shares to Neutral from Underweight with a $4.50 price target, saying CHK's default risk over the next two years is diminished following $950M of divestitures, a more lenient credit agreement, several debt-to-equity transactions and an improving natural gas narrative.CHK should be able to successfully address upcoming maturities, anticipated outspend and working capital requirements, the firm says.CHK continues to suffer from significant debt, large upcoming maturities and a declining production profile, but Jaffray believes the company's recent actions have improved the outlook for the stock.

Oklahoma quakes decline; officials cite curbs on oil and gas disposal wells
The number of earthquakes in Oklahoma has fallen 25% YTD from a year ago, a decline attributed in part to actions by state regulators to restrict the oil and gas industry’s practice of pumping wastewater from its operations deep underground.More than 2,700 temblors of magnitude 2.5 or higher occurred in Oklahoma last year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey; the state experienced 1,097 quakes of similar magnitude in the first six months of this year, down from ~1,400 over the same period in 2015.Oklahoma's leading oil and gas producers include CLR, CHK, DVN, MRO, NFX and XEC.

ConocoPhillips tops list of methane emitters, study says
Eleven of the biggest U.S. oil and gas producers leak so much methane gas into the atmosphere every year that the emissions would be the equivalent of running seven coal-fired power plants for a year, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress.Using 2014 data, the report says the top five U.S. methane emitters were ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and BP America.The Obama administration has announced a goal to lower methane emissions from oil and gas by 40%-45% from 2012 levels by 2025, and the EPA also is preparing standards for methane emissions for current oil and gas wells.

Marathon Oil +10% following prime STACK acquisition
Marathon Oil (MRO +10.4%) powers higher after snapping up P-E-backed PayRock Energy for $888M, increasing its footprint in Oklahoma's prolific STACK oil play.MRO expects internal rates of return for the new addition of 60%-80% before taxes at a WTI price of $50/bbl.CEO Lee Tillman says MRO would ratchet up drilling activity if crude prices held above $50/bbl for a while, and that the Oklahoma oil region is profitable enough that it can compete for capital against the company’s other oil plays.SunTrust analysts consider ~60% of Payrock’s position to be in the core STACK, and estimates the core acreage value at ~$15K/acre, which appears in line with recent transactions.The firm also thinks MRO's move is good news for core STACK players Newfield Exploration (NFX +0.5%), Cimarex Energy (XEC +1.3%), Continental Resources (CLR +1.2%), Devon Energy (DVN +4.6%) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK +3.3%).

Chesapeake -6.7% as RBC downgrades on looming leverage concerns
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -6.7%) is downgraded to Underperform from Sector Perform with a $5 price target at RBC Capital, mostly on concerns about $2.2B in looming debt maturities.The firm also notes that CHK has another $1B in debt coming due in 2019 and again in 2020, so much-needed free cash flow could be scarce over the two-year period.CHK closed a $385M sale of oil and gas assets this month tied to the western Anadarko Basin, but RBC says the company would be better off selling more of its acreage to shore up cash, pointing to the 42K acres recently sold for $470M.RBC also cites valuation in its downgrade, as well as its view that CHK's opportunities to add value in a rising commodity market are more limited than its peers.

"Better opportunities ahead" for Chesapeake, but not now, analyst says
Chesapeake Energy's (CHK +7.5%) recent debt-for-equity swaps that helped reduce its near-term borrowings make sense but come at the expense of dilution to shareholders, Wunderlich analyst Jason Wangler says, arguing that better opportunities lie ahead to purchase CHK shares.CHK's transactions over the past few months reflect a ~10% dilution in exchange for a ~4% reduction in the debt level, and Wangler expects CHK to continue making similar moves, specifically for its near-term maturities, to reduce debt and debt metrics; refinancing the debt would be more expensive, and potentially difficult, so reducing the overall debt is a positive, he says.But the firm maintains its Hold rating and $6 price target on CHK as multiple and/or sizable deals likely are still to come, and "there could be better opportunities ahead once the dilution and debt reductions are completed."

Chesapeake Energy still has further to fall, Credit Suisse says
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +4.8%) shares are trying to recoup some of their recent losses, but Credit Suisse sees no reason to adjust its Neutral rating with a $4 price target that suggests the stock has further to fall.Credit Suisse says CHK remains on track to meet its target for asset sales of $1.2B-$1.7B in 2016, but the firm worries about the $1.625B debt maturity the company faces next year.The firm notes that CHK had $436M in cash and had reduced drilling capex by $40M at the midpoint to further preserve liquidity but still faces the $1.625B maturity overhang, although the recent STACK sale did not result in a change to its $4B borrowing base, which gives the company liquidity flexibility.Now read Chesapeake Energy shares still worth just $1, analyst says May 11, 2016, 2:34 PM | 56 Comments

Chesapeake +6% after in-line Q1 earnings, asset sale
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +5.8%) surges in early trading after posting a Q1 loss that met Wall Street expectations and striking a $470M sale of some Oklahoma assets to Newfield Exploration.Analysts at Sterne Agee CRT say the two factors "further dent the weakening bear case on CHK... We expect CHK shares to respond favorably to another bullish reset to asset sale proceeds that minimizes the impact to current production, as well as to continued strong operational results."CHK says average Q1 production expenses were $3.36/boe, 31% lower than the year-ago quarter, prompting the company to lower its full-year guidance for production expenses.CHK says Q1 production averaged 672.4K boe/day, above the consensus forecast of 651K boe/day; associated production from the STACK asset sale is only 3.8K boe/day, less than 1% of CHK’s total current production.Of the STACK sale, CHK says the move will "contribute substantially" to reaching the company's target for $500M-$1B in asset sales by year-end, and that more divestitures are expected for Q2 and Q3.Wells Fargo analysts suggest remaining on the sidelines, however, believing CHK still needs a transformative M&A transaction, higher gas prices, and/or some meaningful delevering event.Now read Chesapeake Q1 results: The worst is over May 5, 2016, 10:27 AM | 1 Comment

Baaken, Eagle Ford fracking leading to surge in dangerous gas - study
A new study finds that fracking of U.S. shale fields is causing a global surge in ethane emissions. Ethane is known to contribute to global warming and dangerous air pollution.Global ethane levels had been falling since the 1980s, but in 2010 a sensor in Europe picked up a surprise increase. U.S. shale fracking was thought to be the culprit. More recently, a single field in the North Dakota and Montana Bakken Formation has been found to be emitting 2% of the worldwide total."Two percent might not sound like a lot, but the emissions we observed in this single region are 10 to 100 times larger than reported in inventories. They directly impact air quality across North America. And they're sufficient to explain much of the global shift in ethane concentrations," said Eric Kort, the first author of the new study published in Geophysical Research Letters.Ethane emissions from other U.S. fields, especially the Texas Eagle Ford, likely contributed as well, the research team says. The findings illustrate the key role of shale oil and gas production in rising ethane levels.Baaken stocks include: CLR, ERF, EOG, HK, HES, MRO, OAS, QEP, SM, STO, TPLM, WLL Eagle Ford stocks include: APC, APA, COG, CRZO, CHK, COP, ECA, XOM, MUR, PXD See the full study here » May 1, 2016, 1:08 PM | 363 Comments
It's a mixed bag for oil and gas companies in early trade
The energy sector (XLE +0.1%) pokes into the green as crude oil prices pare earlier losses even after the collapse of the Doha meeting, and it's a mixed bag among the top global oil companies in early trading: XOM +0.1%, CVX +0.3%, RDS.A -0.9%, BP -0.3%, TOT -0.4%.Kuwait may have achieved what Doha failed to do, at least in the short term, as a labor strike that began Sunday has cut the country's production by 60%, shuttering 1.7M bbl/day, slightly more than H1's global surplus that caused prices drop to a 12-year low in January.Some oil analysts say the lack of a Doha deal is better for oil prices in the long run now that the rebalancing process of supply and demand can continue to its natural conclusion.Other noteworthy names: KMI -0.1%, CHK -4%, MRO -1.4%, COP +0.1%, SLB +0.2%, HAL +0.2%, BHI -0.7%, OXY +0.5%, APC -0.1%, HES +0.6%, ENB +0.8%, ETP -0.4%, EPD +1.5%.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, FCG, ERY, GASL, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, FENY, IEZ, PXE, PXI, FIF, PXJ, RYE, NDP, GUSH, PSCE, DRIP, DDG, FXN Now read No deal!

Bloomberg: Oil drillers feel the pain as banks cut their credit lines
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) was able to maintain its $4B bank line but many of its competitors are faring far worse: Since the start of 2016, lenders have yanked $5.6B of credit from 36 oil and gas producers, a 12% reduction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Banks are cutting their oil and gas exposure in part because they are facing pressure from regulators and investors to rein in risk; JPMorgan said today that it had set aside another $529M to cover expected energy loan losses."The banks are walking a tightrope," says Bloomberg's Spencer Cutter. "They don’t want to push the companies into bankruptcy, but on the other hand they’re getting a lot of heat from regulators and investors. They can’t keep kicking the can down the road like they did last year."At least 15 companies have seen their credit lines cut, including Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), Rex Energy (NASDAQ:REXX), Halcon Resources (NYSE:HK), Goodrich Petroleum (GDP) and Midstates Petroleum (NYSE:MPO).ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, FCG, ERY, GASL, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, FENY, IEZ, PXE, FIF, PXJ, RYE, NDP, GUSH, DRIP, DDG, FXN Apr. 13, 2016, 7:12 PM | 39 Comments

Further, the ongoing crude recovery and what we believe will be a significant gas price rebound in 2017 should strengthen tailwinds" for the stock.Citi upgraded CHK debt to Market Weight from Underweight, noting that "the borrowing base is down less than our 20% expectation [and] there have been more open market purchases to reduce the maturity wall."Now read Chesapeake Energy: The big relief and Chesapeake Energy scores big win to avoid bankruptcy Apr. 12, 2016, 3:55 PM | 28 Comments

Chesapeake gets 20% shot in the arm after reaching new debt agreement
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +19.1%) surges nearly 20% after winning an amended agreement with its lenders that affirms its revolving credit facility at $4B and postpones the next review of the credit facility’s borrowing base to June 2017.In exchange, CHK pledged “substantially all of the company’s assets, including mortgages encumbering 90% of all the company’s proved oil and gas properties” as collateral.The agreement is good for CHK, since it buys "time to ride out a low commodity price environment," and even for the broader energy group since a CHK bankruptcy could have brought down an outsized portion of the sector with it, Matt DiLallo writes.Citi says a 2016 Chapter 11 event is now off the table, but an "uphill battle still lies ahead,” as the company still needs to sell assets to avoid risk of bankruptcy down the road; the firm upgrades CHK's 2017 and 2018 high-yield notes to Buy, even as CHK’s bonds already have been among the best performing in the energy sector rebound.Now read I don't think Chesapeake's debt is safer than its shares any longer Apr. 11, 2016, 3:32 PM | 45 Comments

Chesapeake Energy's borrowing base maintained at $4B
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) +6.6% premarket on news that its borrowing base was reaffirmed at $4B, although it agreed to pledge additional assets as collateral in connection with the redetermination.CHK says the amendment provides temporary covenant relief, with the credit facility's senior secured leverage ratio suspended until September 2017, reduces the interest coverage ratio to 0.65x from 1.1x through March 2017, and requires CHK to maintain a $500M minimum liquidity amount.CHK says the next borrowing base redetermination review is postponed until June 2017.Now read Chesapeake Energy: An unprecedented mess Apr. 11, 2016, 8:43 AM | 47 Comments

Chesapeake Energy could gain 90% from here, analyst says
SunTrust's Neal Dingmann raises his price target on volatile Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.1%) to $7 from $6, implying ~90% upside potential, driven by the firm's above-consensus 2017 EBITDA estimate of $1.9B applied to a 7.5x price target multiple.SunTrust says material assets sales and major financial improvements continue to put CHK in a better position than many expected and combined with a conservative capital budget provide a more positive outlook through at least this year.While CHK's leverage remains higher than the peer group average at ~7x, Dingmann sees the ratio potentially falling to as low as 3.5x next year as debt is paid down and EBITDA improves, and $4B-plus liquidity should sustain the spring redetermination and provide plenty of funding for further debt repurchases and operating activities.Now read Chesapeake Energy: Stellar STACK economics and more debt reduction Apr. 5, 2016, 12:22 PM | 24 Comments

USGS forecast includes human-induced quakes for first time
The U.S. Geological Survey releases maps that for the first time show potential seismic dangers from man-made as well as naturally-occurring earthquakes.The states most as risk of earthquakes from oil and gas activity - Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas, in order - are largely concentrated in regions where the energy industry disposes of millions of gallons of wastewater that is produced during the drilling and pumping process.In 2015, the USGS recorded 2,500 quakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or higher in Oklahoma, up from just three in 2005; the state's leading oil and gas producers include CLR, CHK, DVN, SD and MRO.

Report: Chesapeake considering 1.5-lien debt exchange
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) is considering swapping out some of its existing debt for new 1.5-lien debt, according to a report from CapitalStructure.CHK has not yet made any decisions on the swap, and the timing is uncertain, but the swap is seen as attractive based on the current pricing of CHK bonds, the report says.CHK completed another bond swap last year when it offered debtholders secured bonds paying 8% interest for unsecured bonds, but the offer was considered a failure because holders of debt maturing in the near term did not widely participate in the deal.

Aubrey McClendon, the former chief executive of Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), was driving at roughly 88 miles per hour before he slammed into a bridge abutment earlier this month and died, Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty said at a press conference.The death of the energy entrepreneur on March 2 shocked the oil and gas industry less than a day after he was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on allegations of violating antitrust rules by rigging bids for land.Previously: Feds move to dismiss McClendon indictment (Mar. 04 2016) Mar. 15, 2016, 3:07 AM | 26 Comments
WSJ: Oil company CEOs keep drilling because they're paid to
Markets have been waiting for U.S. oil companies to cut production amid lower crude prices, but many of the companies have been paying their top executives to keep the oil flowing, according to a WSJ analysis.“You want to know why most of the industry outspent cash flow last year trying to grow production? That's the way they're paid," says EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) CEO William Thomas.An example: Hess (NYSE:HES) CEO John Hess earned more than $1M in 2014 (the most recent year available for pay data), which was more than a third of his bonus, because the company beat production and reserve targets.Also: Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) CEO R.A. Walker earned ~$1.5M because the company’s output rose 8% and exceeded goals for finding new oil and gas deposits.Thomas and others at EOG derived just 8% of their bonuses from hitting production and reserve targets in 2014, and instead placed more emphasis on return on capital, relative stock price and spending, WSJ says.Some shareholder activists are seeking to limit bonuses tied to production and reserve growth, pitching proxy ballot measures at companies such as Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN).Companies will detail how they calculated 2015 bonuses in proxy filings beginning this month.

Chesapeake Energy higher on more asset sale chatter
The company is mulling the sale of shale assets in the Oklahoma Stack, according to Bloomberg, and has had talks with potential advisors and buyers.The assets being sold could fetch in the area of $300M-$700M, according to a source.The Stack, along with another Oklahoma field called the Scoop, are two of the best places to drill at the moment as producers can still make money even at current oil and gas prices.Chesapeake (CHK +6%) has agreed to sell $700M of assets this year and expects another $1B of sales by year-end. The company controls about 1.8M net acres in the Stack with at least 1.2K potential drilling locations. Mar. 9, 2016, 12:04 PM | 21 Comments

Chesapeake Energy headlines epic short squeeze in energy stocks
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) was the largest gainer on the S&P 500 for the third day in a row, soaring 19% in today's trade to cap an 89% surge for the week - thanks in no small part to the big short squeeze in the energy sector following the bounce in crude oil prices.Short interest in CHK rose to 234.7M shares during February's H1, ~40.5% of the public float and more than triple the short interest of a year ago (Briefing.com).Many energy names have high short interest, so short-covering is certain to be playing a part in the momentum behind some of this week's movers, including Atwood Oceanics (ATW, with short interest at 42% of the float), Transocean (RIG, short interest 38.6% of float), Hornbeck Offshore (HOS, 36.5%), Bonanza Creek Energy (BCEI, 32.4%), SM Energy (SM, 26.6%), Tidewater (TDW, 22.3%), Noble Corp. (NE, 21.1%), Whiting Petroleum (WLL, 19.9%), Lucas Energy (LEI, 19%), Denbury Resources (DNR, 18.8%), Seadrill (SDRL, 17%). Mar. 4, 2016, 6:35 PM | 91 Comments
Feds move to dismiss McClendon indictment
Federal prosecutors have moved to dismiss the indictment of Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) founder Aubrey McClendon, "for the reason that...the defendant is now deceased."But while the case against McClendon is expected to end, sources told CNBC that the DOJ's broader investigation into possible collusion in the oil and natural gas industry is ongoing.His indictment sent tremors through the energy sector, as other companies and investors fretted over who else could face charges, but Chesapeake itself recorded its biggest two-day gain in its history (+60%) after receiving immunity on condition that they are first to report antitrust violations.

Chesapeake +72% in two days after winning immunity in antitrust case
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +34.4%) looks headed for the biggest two-day gain in its history after announcing its cooperation in the federal antitrust case against former CEO Aubrey McClendon.CHK says it received immunity under a Justice Department leniency program that shields companies from criminal charges if they are first to report antitrust violations.University of Houston law professor Darren Bush tells CNBC that the way the indictment was written by prosecutors "indicated they targeted McClendon as having initiated the conspiracy," and was "the big fish" prosecutors were after.Bush also says it is probable that the co-conspirator in the case - reportedly former SandRidge (SD +19.3%) CEO Tom Ward - had agreed to testify against McClendon at trial, and then plead guilty afterward.NYU law professor Harry First says it is possible that the alleged co-conspirator testified against McClendon before the grand jury that ended up indicting him, and the conspirator would have been granted immunity from his own testimony being used against him as part of a separate prosecution.

Former Chesapeake CEO McClendon dies in car crash
Aubrey McClendon, the former Chesapeake Energy (CHK +27.7%) founder and CEO who was indicted yesterday for conspiring to rig bids for oil and natural gas leases, has died in a car crash, CNBC reports.McClendon crashed into an embankment while traveling at a "high rate of speed" this morning, according to the Oklahoma City Police Department, which also said "he pretty much drove straight into the wall."Shares have been moving higher all day - not related to the fatal accident - after CHK said it did not expect to face criminal prosecution or fines related to the indictment.

Chesapeake Energy -6% premarket in wake of McClendon indictment
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) -5.9% premarket after former CEO Aubrey McClendon was indicted for rigging bids on oil and gas leases.CHK says it "does not expect to face criminal prosecution or fines" related to the matter, adding that the company has taken significant steps to address legacy issues and comply with laws and regulations.The DoJ charges that the participants in the alleged bid-rigging scheme decided ahead of time who would win the leases; the state of Michigan made similar allegations against CHK, and the company settled that case for $25M last year.McClendon, who calls the charges "wrong and unprecedented," says he is being "singled out" as the only person in the oil and gas industry in more than 110 years to be charged under the Sherman Act for oil and gas leasing activity.Among notable recent cases where the DoJ pursued criminal charges against CEOs, former Peanut Corp. of America president Stewart Parnell was sentenced to 28 years in prison for a cover-up that led to a deadly salmonella outbreak, and former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was convicted of conspiracy to violate federal mine safety laws but was acquitted of lying to investors and regulators about the company’s safety record.DoJ release Mar. 2, 2016, 7:56 AM | 18 Comments
DoJ indicts ex-Chesapeake Energy CEO McClendon
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) co-founder and former CEO Aubrey McClendon is indicted by the U.S. Justice Department for conspiring to rig bids for oil and natural gas leases.The indictment alleges that McClendon led a conspiracy between two companies not to bid against each other for purchases of leases in Oklahoma.The alleged conspiracy took place during 2007-12, and the companies are accused of deciding who would win the bids, then giving an interest in the leases to the other company.McClendon was in the vanguard of the shale revolution and amassed a shale empire at CHK before he was dismissed in 2013 amid conflict-of-interest probes and a shareholder revolt.CHK -4.3% AH.

Chesapeake says parties seek collateral after debt downgrades
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -2.8%) says debt downgrades from ratings agencies in December have its counterparties including pipeline companies asking for collateral to assure them of the company's financial stability.Moody's and S&P downgraded CHK's rating into junk territory in December, but since then parties have asked the company to post ~$220M collateral, and CHK may need to post another $698M, which could negatively impact its liquidity, according to a 10-K filing.Earlier: Chesapeake downgraded at Fitch, shares pull back from yesterday's surge Feb. 25, 2016, 3:37 PM | 65 Comments
Chesapeake downgraded at Fitch, shares pull back from yesterday's surge
Fitch Ratings is the latest agency to downgrade Chesapeake Energy (CHK -5.7%), dropping the company's credit rating to B- from B with a negative outlook.Fitch says the downgrade reflects the heightened liquidity risk given the prospect for a lower and longer price recovery profile, as well as the potential for low oil prices to hurt CHK’s plans to raise liquidity through asset sales that also could have an unfavorable impact on the next round of borrowing-base redeterminations.Shares are pulling back from yesterday's 22% surge that followed the company's Q4 results, as investors liked CHK's plans to repay its $500M in bonds due next month, taking near-term default worries off the table, and news that it had agreed to or signed $700M in asset sales YTD, above an earlier target of $200M-$300M.

Chesapeake Energy to sell Western Anadarko Basin assets for $385M
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +21.7%) agrees to sell its remaining Western Anadarko Basin oil and gas assets to privately-held FourPoint Energy for $385M.The assets to be acquired include an interest in nearly 3,500 producing wells primarily in the Granite Wash, Missourian Wash, Upper and Lower Cleveland and Tonkawa formations in western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle.CHK has reversed early premarket losses, as its deals to divest $700M in gas fields and other assets and plans to sell $500M-$1B in additional assets this year allow it to pay off debt coming due in three weeks.Seeking Alpha contributor Daniel Moore says CHK now has a lifeline into 2017 and possibly much longer but its long-term recovery remains linked to its ability to create a competitive cost structure.

Chesapeake -4% premarket as losses widen, capex cut more than half
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) -4.1% premarket after swinging to a Q4 loss on less than half the revenue from the year-ago quarter, and announcing drastic capex cuts.CHK is budgeting total FY 2016 capital spending of $1.3B-$1.8B, 57% less at the midpoint than its 2015 capex of $3.6B.CHK says it expects to place 330-370 wells on production, resulting in total production that declines 0%-5% Y/Y, after adjusting for asset sales.CHK also says it has signed agreements to divest $700M in gas fields and other assets, more than the $200M-$300M forecast provided in December, and plans another $500M-$1B in asset sales in 2016.The asset sales may ease concern among bondholders and analysts that CHK was struggling under the weight of a debt burden that S&P recently described as “unsustainable.”"In light of the challenging commodity price environment, our focus for 2016 is to improve our liquidity, further reduce our cost structure and address our near-term debt maturities to strengthen our balance sheet," CEO Doug Lawler says.Update (8:09 am): CHK has turned around in volatile premarket action, now +7.3%.

Williams moves up as Energy Transfer merger inches closer
Some analysts believe the merger of Williams Cos. (WMB, WPZ) and Energy Transfer Equity (ETE, ETP) is inching closer to fruition, after WMB said last week that it remains committed to the much-maligned deal.Raymond James analyst Darren Horowitz believes the highest probability outcome remains that WMB and ETE continue with the previously agreed-upon merger terms, and that it is in management’s best interest to provide as much deal-related transparency as legally possible.Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, thinks more encouragement came from some reassurance on WMB's earnings conference call that the company is not overly exposed to the risk that Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), which provides about 18% of WMB's cash flow, could go bankrupt and stop making payments.However, CTFN reports that January's $1B private placement of debt by WMB subsidiary Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line has led an investor to question the "limitation of guarantees” covenant as it may relate to the merger.

Chesapeake posts 20% surge on buyout speculation
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) jumped 20% in today's trade for its biggest percentage gain since 2008, which Bloomberg credits in part to Giovanni DiMauro's Seeking Alpha article that called CHK a "prime takeout candidate."Speculation that the heavily-indebted CHK may be headed for bankruptcy is unwarranted, a $500M note coming due in March likely will be repaid on time, and "could be swallowed up on the cheap by a player with deep pockets," DiMauro writes.CHK’s 3.25% notes maturing next month have risen to $0.9545 on the dollar after posting a record one-day plunge to $0.84 on Feb. 8, Bloomberg adds.CHK is scheduled to post Q4 financial results on Wednesday.

More pain ahead for Chesapeake, Encana among E&P stocks, analyst says
Bernstein analyst Bob Brackett tags Chesapeake Energy (CHK +17%) and Encana (ECA +5.6%) as the E&P stocks that could cause the most pain for investors going forward.CHK already has suffered plenty, but Brackett writes thinks it has the highest risk of bankruptcy in his coverage universe, and the current stock price "essentially shuts it out of the equity market,” while ECA is most likely to issue equity and see its credit rating cut to junk status.Meanwhile, Brackett thinks EOG Resources (EOG +3.8%) is the safest play due largely to a returns-oriented culture and relative conservatism in the early part of this cycle, while ConocoPhillips (COP +4.4%) and Devon Resources (DVN +9%) already have made their big moves - a big dividend cut and an equity raise, respectively - which relieves the pressure on management to take further drastic steps.

Soros exits several energy stakes, takes Pfizer position
George Soros, who has warned of a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis but this time with China as the focus of most problems, exited stakes in several energy-related companies and took a position in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) during Q4.According to a 13-F filing, the Soros fund disclosed it had exited stakes in Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG), and reduced its position in Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW); Soros bought ~685K shares in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), which is merging with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), as well as 50.7K shares in Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI).Soros also closed his stake in Olin Corp. (NYSE:OLN) and cut his stake in Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO), and took a position valued at $216M in Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), which was spun off from GE.Overall, the value of Soros’ holdings fell to $6.05B as of Dec. 31, from $6.61B at the end of Q3.

Sierra Club sues Chesapeake, Devon Energy over rising quake risks
The Sierra Club is suing units of Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), accusing the companies' fracking practices of causing tremors in Oklahoma and Kansas.The group blames the practice of injecting liquid oil and gas waste into deep ground-wells for helping cause a spike of more than 5,800 earthquakes in Oklahoma in 2015, up from an annual high of 167 in the years from 1977 to 2009, according to the complaint filed in federal court in Oklahoma City.Meanwhile, Oklahoma state regulators unveil their largest volume reduction plan yet for oil and gas disposal wells in western Oklahoma’s Arbuckle formation in response to increased numbers of earthquakes; the plan, along with an earlier reduction plan, will bring the total volume cutback for the entire area to more than 500K bbl/day, or ~40%.

Bloomberg: Chesapeake plans to pay $500M debt due next month
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -7.3%) remains sharply lower even after a Bloomberg report that it is is planning to pay $500M of debt maturing in March, using a combination of cash on hand and other liquidity that may include its credit line.CHK also is considering selling assets to shore up its capital so it can address more than $1B of debt coming due in 2017, according to the report.Creditors are gearing up for negotiations over how to reorganize CHK's ~$10B debt load, and at least one group of unsecured bondholders is said to have hired advisers to help evaluate the company’s assets in the U.S.

Chesapeake Energy price target slashed to $0.50 at UBS
Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE:CHK) Sell rating is reiterated at UBS but with a $0.50 price target, cut from $2, seeing minimal value for the equity unless oil and gas rallies materially.Assuming 2016 capex of less than $1B - which would mark a 70% Y/Y drop and well below consensus of $2.5B/yr - UBS projects a $1B/year free cash flow deficit; the firm also estimates CHK is on a path to chew through $3.9B of liquidity, and risks having its credit facility reduced and business impaired from under-investment.UBS says asset sales would be challenged given that most shales are uneconomic at current prices, and that Williams Cos. is unlikely to renegotiate midstream contracts which are estimated to cost CHK ~$1.2B/year.

Fortunes of several pipeline giants are intertwined with Chesapeake's woes
Chesapeake Energy’s (NYSE:CHK) problems illustrate the potential for a domino effect in U.S. pipeline companies, and threatens to shatter the assumption of many investors that the companies are insulated from plunging energy prices.CHK has commitments to pay ~$2B/year for space on pipelines run by MLPs; Williams Cos. (WMB, WPZ) has the most exposure to CHK after buying the company's logistics assets for $6B in 2014CHK's distress threatens the $33B Williams-Energy Transfer (ETE, ETP) tie-up announced last September, and has been a drag on WMB's credit rating, which could cause headaches for ETE if the merger goes through.WMB likely will be forced to accept a 50% price cut in its contract price with CHK, either through the courts or mutual renegotiation - which would equal a drop of $300M in annual cash flow - says InfraCap portfolio manager Jay Hatfield.Williams and Energy Transfer "would be way better off if they did not merge,” Hatfield says. “I can’t believe that both stocks wouldn’t rocket if the deal was called off.”Other companies with CHK contracts include Spectra Energy Partners (NYSE:SEP), Columbia Pipeline Partners (NYSE:CPPL) and Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) MPLX unit; a SEP spokesperson tells Reuters that its CHK contract to supply gas out of the Marcellus Shale accounted for less than 3% of its 2015 revenues.Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) has not disclosed its exposure to CHK.

"The worst isn't over" for MLPs, Kaiser says
The MLP sector needs to "absorb more pain" before it can represent a "compelling investment," Hedgeye's Kevin Kaiser said in a Barron's weekend profile of the controversial analyst, adding that the "pain" can come in but one form: a reduction in distributions that investors cherish.The longtime MLP bear disagrees with the analysts and MLP investors who think the sector is deeply undervalued now that the benchmark Alerian MLP index is down 45%, countering that “we’re in the early innings of the MLP down-cycle. We had a 15-year up-cycle, and now we’re a year and a half into the downturn.”Kaiser first gained Wall Street attention as the only bear among more than 20 analysts that covered Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI); while most of the damage has been done, Kaiser thinks KMI could fall further, to below $10, as he sees KMI still overleveraged with $41B of net debt, more than 5x annual cash flow.On Linn Energy (LINE, LNCO) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), "we said those stocks could be going to zero, and I think we’re going to be right," Kaiser adds.ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, MLPL, YMLP, TYG, SRV, KYE, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, MLPA, KMF, EMLP, FMO, FEI, JMF, MLPN, SRF, CBA, MLPG, MLPX, GMZ, EMO, MLPS, MLPY, TTP, CTR, AMZA, GER, ZMLP, CEN, AMU, YMLI, SMM, MIE, DSE, FPL, ENFR, ATMP, JMLP, MLPC, MLPW Feb. 8, 2016, 5:45 PM | 73 Comments

Chesapeake Energy's end isn't so near, WSJ's Jakab writes
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) is in survival mode, but investors have reacted with undue alarm to steps it has taken to stay afloat, writes Heard On The Street's Spencer Jakab.Shares closed one-third lower today on reports that CHK had hired a restructuring adviser, setting bankruptcy alarm bells ringing, before the company denied it was preparing a filing; shares also sank last month when it suspended preferred dividends, and the previous month when it issued second-lien notes to redeem some debt at a discount.Each of these cash-preserving moves was predictable, Jakab argues, and despite a mountain of debt, CHK is "likely to hang on while many smaller companies fail this year," although "between now and then, brace for more bouts of panic selling."

Wunderlich upgrades Cimarex; downgrades CHK, HK, OAS, WLL, SD
A lower outlook for oil and natural gas prices prompts a round of reductions in energy company estimates, ratings and price targets at Wunderlich, which downgrades Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Halcon Resources (NYSE:HK), Oasis Petroleum (NYSE:OAS) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) to Hold from Buy and SandRidge Energy (NYSE:SD) to Sell from Hold.Wunderlich also upgrades Cimarex (NYSE:XEC) to Buy from Hold with a $122 price target price, as the stock has weakened and the firm gives more credit to the company for its Cana-Woodford assets.The firm says nearly all of its covered companies that predominantly operate in the Bakken Shale are now rated Hold or Sell, but that it mostly reflects the tougher economics of the region rather than the quality of the companies.

Chesapeake Energy downgraded at S&P on revised oil and gas price outlook
Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE:CHK) credit rating is downgraded to CCC+ from B with a negative outlook at S&P, reflecting the ratings firm's lower base case oil and natural gas price assumptions.S&P says it lowered its 2016, 2017 and long-term price assumptions for Henry Hub gas by more than 15% and WTI crude by ~20%%, which resulted in significantly weaker financial measures for CHK, with FFO/debt below 5% and debt/EBITDA well over 10x for the next two years; at such levels, S&P assesses CHK's debt leverage as "unsustainable."CHK was downgraded to B from BB- just last month.CHK finished today's trade -15.5% at $2.96.

Chesapeake Energy suspends preferred stock dividends

Moody's places 175 oil, gas and mining companies on review for downgrade
Moody's places 120 oil and gas companies on review for a downgrade, in a sweeping global review that includes all major regions and ranges from the world's top global majors such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Total (NYSE:TOT) and BP to 69 U.S. E&P and services firms.Warning of "a substantial risk that prices may recover much more slowly over the medium term than many companies expect, as well as a risk that prices might fall further," Moody's now sees both WTI and Brent crude averaging $33/bbl this year, a $7 cut for WTI and a $10 reduction for Brent from its previous forecast.The ratings firm also places 55 mining companies on review for downgrade as they battle a slump in commodity prices.Among the companies placed on review are Alcoa (NYSE:AA), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Statoil (NYSE:STO), Vale (NYSE:VALE), Goldcorp (NYSE:GG), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO).ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, ERY, FCG, DIG, GASL, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, FENY, PXE, PXI, FIF, PXJ, NDP, RYE, FXN, DDG Jan. 22, 2016, 8:28 AM | 73 Comments
Only CHK, GST, UPL face potential credit issues before 2018, analyst says
A new report from Sterne Agee CRT analyst Tim Rezvan suggests the situation for oil and gas E&P stocks is not as bad as the market fears for many companies.After studying liquidity positions of the E&P names under the firm's coverage, Rezvan concludes that only Chesapeake Energy (CHK +4%), Gastar Exploration (GST +13.2%) and Ultra Petroleum (UPL +25.7%) face potential credit issues prior to 2018.Conversely, Rezvan says Oasis Petroleum (OAS +8.5%) and Whiting Petroleum (WLL +11.3%) maintain strong liquidity despite sharp equity underperformance and can withstand the reduction in credit facilities expected this spring from lending banks feeling stress in their energy loan portfolios.The firm has Buy ratings on OAS and WLL, and Neutral ratings on CHK, GST and UPL.

Southwestern Energy +13% as shale gas suddenly seen as refuge
Southwestern Energy (SWN +13.2%) reverses sharp early losses and power to strong gains, as gas-focused E&P companies may be seen as a safe haven for investors seeking energy stocks but are anxious to avoid exposure to crude oil prices near 13-year lows."Gas is actually gives a bit of stability here,” Subash Chandra, managing director of Guggenheim Securities, tells Bloomberg, as gas producers already have adjusted to lower prices and are taking measures to stem a supply glut, similar to the one that crude oil is now navigating.Other notable gas-focused gainers today include Chesapeake Energy (CHK +5.8%), EQT Corp. (EQT +3.5%), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG +3.6%), and Range Resources (RRC +7.1%)."Gas has absolutely nothing to do with oil,” Oppenheimer's Fadel Gheit says, adding that the equities will advance if nat gas reaches $3.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Jan. 20, 2016, 3:48 PM | 43 Comments

Chesapeake Energy sinks to 16-year low as biggest S&P 500 loser
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) fell more than 13% today to its lowest since April 2000, making it the worst performer in the S&P 500 Index, on investor concern that falling oil prices would hurt the company’s ability to repay debt."Chesapeake tends to move more than others because of their financial leverage," says Subash Chandra, managing director of Guggenheim Securities, who says CHK and some other oil and gas firms will be "delevering for years."CHK shares have plunged 84% in the past year, and are down nearly 32% YTD.ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) was the day's second-worst oil and gas performer, falling as much as 9.6% before settling for a 7.4% drop, its lowest close since March 2009.

Oil and gas companies will be "delevering for years," Guggenheim says
Oil and gas companies such as Devon Energy (DVN -6.5%), Chesapeake Energy (CHK -15.2%) and Continental Resources (CLR -15.1%) will be “in a delevering phase for years," Guggenheim analysts say.Guggenheim says CLR CFO John Hart recently revealed a post-recovery spending plan that still appears within cash flows, confirming its bias that the E&P sector will be in a delevering phase for years, so activity levels will be slow to ramp and will remain subdued.For levered growth to return, the firm says the sector should first have resized land, equipment and personnel completely; while CHK believes it is sized to run 40 rigs instead of the 12 now active, the firm says it is a good sign the company hopes to delever first.

Brace for ugly energy company earnings results, analysts say
Oppenheimer's Fadel Gheit and Luis Amadeo offer a bleak view of the Q4 2015 earnings season for oil and gas producers, warning of sharply lower earnings with deeper losses and wider cash flow deficits Y/Y and Q/Q.Among the integrated oil majors, the analysts see overall Q4 earnings falling by more than 50% Y/Y and more than 30% Q/Q; they expect Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to show the steepest earnings decline of 60%-plus Y/Y and 50%-plus Q/Q, while anticipating Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) to report the lowest declines of 40%-plus Y/Y and 25%-plus Q/Q.Of the 15 large E&Ps Oppenheimer covers, 13 likely will report losses in Q4 vs. 10 in Q3 and none in Q4 2014, with only Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) reporting a profit; the analysts expect most of the other 13 to report steeper declines, including Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), Apache (NYSE:APA), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Hess (NYSE:HES), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Murphy Oil (NYSE:MUR), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) and Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN).Earlier this week, Gheit predicted that half of U.S. shale oil producers could go bankrupt before the crude market reaches equilibrium.

Investors shun energy sector junk bonds
Losses are deepening in the market for low-rated energy debt, as investors worry that the prolonged slump in commodity prices and slowing economic growth will push many companies into default, WSJ reports.Bonds among the biggest losers yesterday were from WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) and Oasis Petroleum (NYSE:OAS), each down ~12% from the previous day, according to the report; a 2019 bond from OAS traded at $0.53 cents on the dollar, and a WPX bond maturing in 2023 traded at $0.655.The losses come after many investors already have exited some larger oil and gas producers in the junk market; for example, a 2023 bond from Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) is trading at $0.285, roughly the same as in mid-December.Energy sector junk bond losses already are near 4% YTD, and the spread vs. U.S. Treasurys hit 14 percentage points on Wednesday, the highest since December 2008, according to Barclays.ETFs: HYG, JNK, HIX, HYLD, DHY, PHT, EAD, HYT, JQC, CIK, DSU, HHY, SJB, NHS, PHF, ACP, FHY, ARDC, MCI, VLT, KIO, CIF, AIF, MHY, ANGL, PCF, DHG, MPV, IVH, HYLS, JSD, UJB, CJNK, GGM, QLTC Jan. 15, 2016, 8:50 AM | 17 Comments
Oklahoma regulator limits 27 disposal wells following recent earthquakes
Operators of 27 oil and natural gas wastewater disposal wells in northwest Oklahoma are asked by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to reduce volume following an outbreak of moderate earthquakes in the past week.Under the voluntary directive, the regulator is asking operators to reduce total volumes into saltwater disposal wells by ~18%, or nearly 54.9K bbl/day.Among the 27 disposal wells are seven operated by SandRidge Energy (NYSE:SD), which has defied a December commission directive to limit disposal well activity in another area of the state; the new directive also includes disposal wells operated by units of Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Midstates Petroleum (NYSE:MPO).More than 30 earthquakes greater than magnitude 3.0 have struck in the area during the past month, including a 4.8-magnitude quake last Thursday.Separately, SD says it is laying off 226 workers at its Lariat Services Group subsidiary in northwestern Oklahoma, ~87% of the total workforce.

Guggenheim slashes 2016 earnings outlook for CHK, COG, RRC
Guggenheim analysts say natural gas fundamentals are improving but they nevertheless cut their earnings forecasts on Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) and Range Resources (NYSE:RRC).Supporting the firm's confidence are EPS revisions for a number of gas operators today suggest that gas supply growth in 2016 could flatline; EIA data for summer 2015 indicates 100% absorption of U.S. supply growth in the power markets through coal displacement; and summer 2016 injections could be the lowest since 2012, despite assumptions for mild weather and recovery in hydro.However, Guggenheim cuts its 2016 EPS forecast for COG to a $0.21 loss from an $0.11 loss, CHK to a $0.59 loss from a $0.54 loss, and RRC to a $0.64 loss from a $0.33 loss; its estimate for Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) improves to a $0.38 loss from a $0.71 loss.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Jan. 12, 2016, 10:34 PM | 9 Comments
Williams companies suffer credit downgrades from Fitch
Williams Cos.

Chesapeake price target cut to $7 from $13 at Wunderlich
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +0.2%) is maintained with a Buy rating at Wunderlich, citing company management and financial stability as well as strong optionality in terms of its asset base, but with a price target cut nearly in half to $7 from $13.The firm praises CHK's move into 2016 with a lower overall debt level, but lowers its price target because of low natural gas prices and lower peer group multiples.The firm says CHK is trading at 3x its 2016 cash flow forecast of $1.57/share, while the peer group is trading at an average price-to-cash flow multiple of 5x, and believes an in-line multiple is warranted for CHK given its improving balance sheet and strong asset base, which results in the $7 price target.

Chesapeake Energy +3.3% even amid Raymond James downgrade
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +3.3%) is sharply higher despite a Raymond James downgrade to Underperform from Market Perform based on a "weak natural gas price forecast and balance sheet concerns."The outcome of CHK's recent effort to exchange notes coming due in 2017 and 2018 was "relatively weak," and the fact that the company had to resort to this measure at all is a sign of trouble, RJ's John Freeman says.Sterne Agee CRT's Tim Rezvan had written in November shortly before CHK announced its offering that "second-lien loans are perceived like scarlet letters," and shares fell 29% since the warning, so Freeman's note seems late to the game, according to TheStreet.com's Carleton English.

Energy stocks see more pain after EIA data arrives
Hit hard two days ago as oil fell below $37/barrel, oil/gas industry names are seeing more pain today after the EIA reported U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.6M barrels last week - expectations were for a decline. The report comes shortly after the API estimated U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.9M barrels during the most recent weekly period.After rising yesterday, WTI crude is down 3.1% to $36.71/barrel. Brent crude is down 2.9% to $36.69/barrel. Nymex natural gas is down 7.3% to $2.20/MMBtu.The biggest decliners include Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.1%), Petrobras (PBR -4.1%), Linn Energy (LINE -7.5%), Gulfport Energy (GPOR -5.2%), SeaDrill (SDRL -5.5%), MV Oil Trust (MVO -4.5%), EV Energy Partners (EVEP -6.7%), and Southwestern Energy (SWN -5.7%).Other notable decliners include Hercules Offshore (HERO -5.2%), Marathon Oil (MRO -4%), Devon Energy (DVN -4.4%), Encana (ECA -4.1%), Range Resources (RRC -4.7%), Sandridge Mississippian Trust (SDR -4%), Newfield Exploration (NFX -3.8%), BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT -3.1%), Enerplus (ERF -3.9%), and ONEOK Partners (OKS -2.5%).ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, ERY, DIG, DUG, BGR, IYE, IEO, FENY, PXE, FIF, PXJ, NDP, RYE, FXN, DDG, DRIP, GUSH Dec. 30, 2015, 12:46 PM | 68 Comments

While Citigroup believes Chesapeake Energy’s (CHK +2.5%) debt load is unsustainable given low energy prices. Morningstar analyst Mark Hanson argues that "default is far from imminent.”Harmon says CHK's two most important milestones over the next few quarters are the final results of the debt exchange offer at the end of this month, and the company’s borrowing base re-determination in mid-April 2016; if each plays out favorably, CHK "should be fine from a covenant and liquidity standpoint through 2018 (albeit without much cushion should oil and gas futures prices fall from current levels)."

Chesapeake "doing all it can in a tough market," analyst says
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +9.4%) continues to power higher even after S&P’s revision of its corporate credit rating to B from BB-, while noting CHK will face challenging industry conditions which will be intensified by high debt levels.Wunderlich analyst Jason Wangler believes CHK is “doing all it can in a tough market... We feel overall the company can make it through and continue to improve its balance sheet to provide liquidity and stability going forward."SunTrust’s Neal Dingmann maintains his Buy rating on CHK even as he cuts the target price to $7 from $10; while acknowledging continued potential near-term pressure, he says CHK’s "solid liquidity, financial engineering along with asset heavy portfolio sets up for improved longer term story with each $0.10/Mcf increase in natural gas price potentially adding ~$100M in EBITDA."

Chesapeake Energy downgraded with negative outlook at S&P
Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE:CHK) credit rating is downgraded to B from BB- at S&P with a negative outlook, as the ratings agency's business risk assessment for CHK is lowered to fair from satisfactory.S&P also cuts CHK's senior unsecured debt rating to CCC+ from BB-, CHK's senior secured debt to BB- from BB+, and CHK's preferred stock to CCC from B-.S&P expects natural gas and crude oil prices to remain under pressure from excess production capacity, and sees CHK's profitability suffering from the high costs associated with its gathering and processing agreements.While CHK's outstanding debt should fall by ~$1.5B based on preliminary results of the recent exchange offer, S&P says the tendered offer failed to significantly ease the upcoming need to address $2.5B of debt maturities or puts through 2017.

Chesapeake’s leverage is unsustainable, Citi analysts say
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -0.2%) is reiterated with an Underperform rating at Citigroup, which says CHK's levered capital structure is unsustainable given the ongoing low commodity prices it faces.Results of CHK's debt exchange showed $2.8B of total par amount was tendered, translating into a $1.7B second lien, and increased the maximum potential size of the new second lien to $3B from $1.5B; Citi believes CHK pushed back the early deadline hoping additional short-maturity paper would tender.In CHK's final early tender results, only ~24% of the outstanding 2017 notes were tendered and the total amount of unsecured notes due within the next 4 years tendered increased to 24% from 22%; Citi says a majority of the incremental tenders came from longer-dated paper, which means CHK still has a sizable maturity wall over the next 2-3 years.Earlier: Reuters: Chesapeake Energy debt swap offers "fails miserably" (Dec. 18) Dec. 22, 2015, 11:46 AM | 18 Comments
Reuters: Chesapeake Energy debt swap offer "fails miserably"
Chesapeake Energy's (CHK +8%) attempt to ease its short-term liquidity woes looks set to "fail miserably," according to a Reuters report, after CHK had extended Wednesday's deadline for the bond exchange by two days.Participation rates from holders of CHK's 2017 and 2018 bonds were just 10%-28%, amounting to just $352M tendered overall on $1.7B in face value, while longer-dated bonds saw ~40% participation."There remains a lot of work for the company to get through this maturity wall and commodity price downdraft," CreditSights analyst Brian Gibbons says on the early tender results.Investors have until 5 pm ET today to decide whether to commit at the early deadline for the aggressive offer, which aims to persuade creditors to swap their current bonds for new senior secured second-lien bonds.CHK's bonds have tanked since the exchange was announced on Dec. 2; the 5.75% 2023s are trading at just $0.27 on the dollar, while the 6.25% euro-denominated 2017s were quoted at 61% of face value, and the 6.5% 2017s at 57%.

Chesapeake Energy hires adviser to probe options, including debt exchange
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.3%) is working with restructuring advisers at Evercore on potential measures to reduce its $11.6B debt load, such as exchanging existing bonds at a discount for new securities or selling assets, Dow Jones reports.CHK bonds, considered a junk bond benchmark because of the company's large debt load, are tumbling today, with a 2019 bond down $0.02 to $0.30.The tumble in natural gas prices has hurt CHK, which has posted three straight quarterly losses this year.

Bloomberg: Billions of barrels of oil vanish in puff of accounting smoke
Companies such as Chesapeake Energy (CHK +1.8%) pushed the SEC for an accounting change in 2009 that made it easier to claim reserves from wells that would not be drilled for years, but Bloomberg says the chickens will come home to roost in the next few months when billions of barrels of shale drillers’ reserves are wiped out.The rule requires the undrilled wells to be profitable and be drilled within five years, but now the time is up, and the companies must soon report 2015 figures - and prices are down, way down.Regulatory filings show CHK's inventory will be cut by 45%, Bill Barrett (BBG +4.1%) will lose as much as 40%, and Oasis Petroleum (OAS +5.8%) will loss 33%."How are these reserves going to come back?” says a Guggenheim Securities analyst. “Because if you have to spend within cash flow, those reserves aren’t coming back. Not unless we get a spike in prices, or we return to levered growth.” Dec. 10, 2015, 11:34 AM | 44 Comments
Chesapeake Energy sued by Pennsylvania AG over deceptive leases
Pennsylvania’s attorney general's office says it is suing Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) over claims the company cheated thousands of landowners who signed drilling leases.The lawsuit alleges that CHK tricked landowners into signing one-sided leases in the early years of the Marcellus Shale drilling boom and then improperly deducted certain post-production expenses from landowner royalties.CHK says the allegations are baseless and that it will challenge the lawsuit.

U.S. gas prices plunge on outlook for warmer weather
Wholesale gas for January delivery has nosedived, dropping 6.3% just this week to just above $2/MMBtu, the lowest for any January-delivered futures contract in 17 years and sinking shares of the biggest gas producers.The traditional pattern is for U.S. gas use to soar in January, as an exceptionally warm start to the cold weather season has undercut forecast gas consumption thanks to El Niño effects that have caused mild temperatures across big northern cities such as New York and Chicago.Meanwhile, gas production from areas such as the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania and Utica Shale of Ohio has kept rising in spite of lower prices.Chesapeake Energy (CHK +0.4%) has dropped 18% in the past week, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG +3.2%) has lost 9%, and EQT (EQT +0.3%) has slid 7%.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Dec. 8, 2015, 12:27 PM | 32 Comments

Energy shares tank as U.S. crude oil slides 4%
The energy sector (-4.5%) paces the opening decline, as WTI crude oil prices -4% at $38.35/bbl following a 2.7% slide on Friday after OPEC's failure to agree on a production target to reduce the oil glut.Investors are betting on oil prices staying lower for even longer after OPEC's non-decision, pushing U.S. crude futures for delivery nearly 10 years away below $60/bbl, Reuters reports.But the oil glut is set to continue as much because of the U.S. as of OPEC, as U.S. shale drillers have only trimmed their pumping a little, and rising oil flows from the Gulf of Mexico are propping up U.S. production; the overall output of U.S. crude fell just 0.2% in September, the most recent monthly federal data available, and is down less than 3%, to 9.3M bbl/day, from the peak in April.Goldman Sachs says it expects oil prices to remain "lower for longer," with a risk that prices could fall as low as $20/bbl.In early trading: XOM -2.9%, CVX -4.1%, BP -3.2%, RDS.A -4.2%, COP -4.6%, MPC -3.2%, MRO -7.4%, PSX -2.8%, HES -4.9%, APC -6.1%, OXY -3.1%, EOG -5.8%, DVN -9.3%, PXD -7.2%, APA -3.9%, CHK -8%, CLR -9.1%.ETFs: USO, OIL, XLE, UCO, UWTI, VDE, ERX, OIH, SCO, XOP, BNO, DBO, DWTI, ERY, FCG, DIG, GASL, DTO, DUG, BGR, USL, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, DNO, FENY, PXE, PXI, PXJ, FIF, OLO, SZO, NDP, RYE, FXN, OLEM, DDG Dec. 7, 2015, 10:35 AM | 118 Comments
Jakab: Chesapeake investors should be relieved, as chance of financial distress reduced
Yesterday's selloff in Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.4%) after the company said it would look to buy back some of its debt is a knee-jerk reaction to a sign of financial distress rather than a cool analysis, Heard On The Street's Spencer Jakab writes.Combined with CHK's move in July to eliminate its dividend to conserve cash, the company has enhanced its odds of riding out the energy storm as a going concern, and the most recent move does not cost shareholders a cent, according to Jakab."Shareholders should be feeling buoyant, not despondent," Jakab writes. "By swapping for the nearer-term debt, Chesapeake lowers the chance of it facing a debt crisis and shareholders being wiped out." Dec. 4, 2015, 11:48 AM | 55 Comments
Chesapeake Energy -14% on note exchange offer
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -14.3%) sinks to 52-week lows after offering to exchange several of its bonds at a discount for new higher-ranking debt, a move the market is reading as a sign of financial distress.The deal is set to add up to $1.5B of new bonds that outrank CHK’s existing notes; holders of bonds bearing 4.875% interest due in 2022 would get as little as $515 in new notes for every $1,000 in principal amount of their old debt, while holders of bonds maturing sooner would take a slimmer discount.CHK joins a growing number of energy companies including Linn Energy, Halcon Resources and Exco Resources in using second and third lien notes, which have a higher priority in bankruptcy, to pare down its unsecured debt and extend its maturities into the future.

Utica Shale gas drillers hit gushers, rewarded with slumping stock prices
A big find would send an energy company’s stock surging in normal times, but in an environment of excess supply, it is having the opposite effect of pushing down share prices. A WSJ report offers a case in point: EQT Corp. (NYSE:EQT) in July drilled what by some measures is the biggest natural gas gusher ever - a well in Pennsylvania's Utica Shale that spewed enough gas in its first 24 hours to power every home in Pittsburgh for nearly three days - but EQT shares have slumped 29% since news of the find.EQT believes the Utica, which has been only lightly explored so far since it lies more than three miles underground, has the potential to be so prolific that it could lower natural gas prices and make competing projects uneconomical.Shares of Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) and Consol Energy (NYSE:CNX) have tumbled a respective 44% and 54% since those companies disclosed their own prolific Utica wells in December and July.Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), which have drilling land above the Utica but derive most of their production from other regions, have dropped a respective 53% and 40% since EQT disclosed the first details of its well.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Nov. 28, 2015, 8:25 AM | 98 Comments
CEO Lawler says 54% of Chesapeake's projects unprofitable when he started
In his first extensive interview since taking over as CEO two years ago, Chesapeake Energy (CHK -3.6%) CEO Doug Lawler tells WSJ he was surprised to learn that 54% of CHK's projects were not profitable in 2012.Problems at the time included CHK and former CEO Aubrey McClendon signing contracts to drill hundreds of wells without regard for their economic viability and transporting some natural gas on specific pipelines or facing large penalties, according to Lawler; as a result, CHK spent nearly $30B more on drilling and leasing than it brought in from its operations during 2010-12.Lawler says CHK's biggest challenge now resides outside the company: low natural gas prices.

WSJ's Jakab: 4T cf in nat gas storage ought to "terrify" energy investors
U.S. natural gas in storage cracked the 4T cf level for the first time, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, 10% higher than a year ago and nearly as much gas as the U.S. can store - a milestone that "should terrify energy investors," writes Heard On The Street's Spencer Jakab.Inventories traditionally peak at the end of the April-October season when heating demand for the fuel is low or nonexistent, but despite subdued new drilling activity, the EIA thinks storage at the end of Q1 2016 will end with a far higher than usual 1.9T cf, which creates a risk of storage filling up even sooner in next year's April-October period.Jakab says the situation will add to the woes among beleaguered natural gas producers, some of which are in financial distress - which could grow more acute; in related news, Chesapeake Energy (CHK -5.6%) is down another 5% today, recording new multiyear lows.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Nov. 20, 2015, 3:54 PM | 79 Comments
Chesapeake investors signaling surrender as bonds plunge to all-time lows
Nearly all of Chesapeake Energy’s (NYSE:CHK) bonds plummeted today to their lowest levels ever, as investors who lent $11B are starting to give up on the company, Bloomberg reports.CHK's $700M of 5.375% unsecured notes due 2021 fell $0.09 to $0.41 on the dollar, while the price of credit default swaps rose to the highest ever; CHK's stock sank 10% today and hit a 13-year low."We are seeing investors capitulate to the reality of the situation,” says one money manager. “They have a lot of debt, they are burning through cash and their earnings profile is not getting any better. They are trading worse than their credit rating suggests, and there is almost certainly a downgrade coming."CHK is making investors worry about its ability to pay back borrowings that are 3x the current worth of its oil and gas fields; the company recorded a $5.4B writedown in value of those fields when it reported earnings earlier this month."There’s an expectation in the market that the company is going to get a second-lien loan,” Sterne Agee analyst Tim Rezvan says. “If that happens, everything that’s subordinate to it comes under pressure.”Earlier: Chesapeake Energy bonds plunge to lowest-ever levels Nov. 19, 2015, 7:20 PM | 55 Comments

Chesapeake Energy -4.5% following analyst downgrade
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.5%) plunges near 52-week lows after Sterne Agee CRT downgrades shares to Neutral from Buy and removes its $13 price target.The firm says CHK’s fortunes would improve greatly in a $3/Mcf gas world but the macro backdrop has changed and that world is unlikely in the near-term, and Monday night’s news that $394M of convertible bonds were put to the company will refocus attention on the need to address the capital structure.CHK's second-lien loan may come soon but may not prove a dramatic equity value creation tool, and a second-lien stigma could overshadow any favorable balance sheet impact, the firm says.

AP: Oklahoma earthquake problem is big trouble for SandRidge Energy
SandRidge Energy’s (NYSE:SD) most important assets are at the epicenter of Oklahoma’s earthquake problem, which combined with SD's precarious financial position could cause the company to become insolvent if regulators shut down its disposal wells, according to an AP analysis.SD is the only independent, publicly traded driller that does not own a major stake in other oil and gas formations, and its cash crunch prevents it from moving operations to another region, the report says.Disposal wells that inject wastewater byproducts into lower rock layers are a key to making the Mississippi Lime play economical, and one in six wells Oklahoma regulators have placed under a microscope belongs to SD, accounting for nearly 85% of the company’s 125 active disposal sites.Other drillers including Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) also operate dozens of disposal wells in the area regulators and state geologists are examining, but the other companies have less to fear because each has assets around the U.S., the report says.

Chesapeake credit downgraded further into junk at Fitch
Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE:CHK) debt rating is cut further below investment grade, to BB- from BB, by Fitch Ratings; shares fell 2.6% in today's trade, in line with other energy producers as crude oil prices fell and amid the higher likelihood of a Fed rate hike.Fitch says CHK’s cash flow, liquidity and leverage profiles will be "notably weaker" than previous expectations because of persistently low oil and gas price realizations and heightened future reliance on asset sales to fund cash flow gaps; it also cites CHK’s increasingly limited ability to invest in its highest return assets in favor of operationally committed and shorter-cycle reserves.Fitch concedes that CHK’s size and scale relative to other high-yield E&P companies provides considerable financial flexibility.

It's all about the cash burn, analyst says, as Chesapeake -6%
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -6.2%) gave up premarket gains and turned sharply lower almost as soon as regular trading began even as it posted a lighter than expected Q3 loss, and Citigroup analyst Robert Morris thinks the move reflects persistent concerns about CHK's cash burn.Morris says CHK ended Q3 with a cash balance of ~$1.76B vs. his $1.95B forecast as the company incurred another drop in working capital ($158M) as it further reduced activity; while production exceeded expectations and costs are being sharply reduced, Morris thinks investor focus remains on "cash burn" and CHK’s ability to execute accretive asset sales to reduce leverage.CHK also cut its 2015 capital spending budget for the second time this year, and said it is prepared for a "significantly lower" capital program in 2016.

Natural gas falls below $2 for first time in three years

Natural gas -8% as forecasts call for warmer than average weather
Natural gas futures are down ~8% as supplies rise toward record levels amid expectations of a warm start to the winter, sending shares of energy companies with heavy exposure to natural gas sharply lower; CHK -8.7%, SM -7.7%, RRC -7.4%.Adding to the volatility is the expiration of the November futures contract Wednesday, which recently was trading at $2.06/MMBtu, a level last seen in 2012."This could be a blow off bottom," says Again Capital's John Kilduff, who says the price is hit by expectations that a record amount of natural gas will soon be in storage; weekly data show gas storage at 3.81T cf vs. a record 3.93T cf in November 2012.Weather forecasts released last night called for “significant warm trends” across much of the U.S. in the next two weeks, according to MDA Weather Services.Crude oil prices also are lower, as lingering concerns over a global supply glut and weakening demand send prices toward their lowest settlement in six weeks.; WTI -1.5% at $43.95/bbl, Brent -0.8% at $47.61.ETFs: UNG, USO, OIL, XLE, UGAZ, UCO, DGAZ, UWTI, VDE, ERX, OIH, SCO, BNO, BOIL, GAZ, DBO, DWTI, ERY, FCG, DIG, GASL, DTO, DUG, KOLD, BGR, USL, IYE, UNL, DNO, FENY, FIF, PXJ, OLO, SZO, RYE, DCNG, FXN, OLEM, DDG Oct. 26, 2015, 2:18 PM | 44 Comments
Bloomberg: "$6.5B in energy writedowns and we're just getting started"
Southwestern Energy's (SWN -6.6%) $2.8B impairment and Freeport McMoRan's (FCX -0.5%) $3.7B charge are just the beginning, as Barclays estimates at least $20B in charges are coming during Q3 for just six companies, as reported by Bloomberg.SWN’s $2.8B writedown was double Barclays’ forecast, which also predicts ceiling-test impairments for Apache (APA -0.1%), Chesapeake Energy (CHK -2.3%), Devon Energy (DVN -0.1%), Encana (ECA -2%) and Newfield Exploration (NFX +0.1%)."Many companies will have writedowns as the price of oil is about half of where it once was and gas is also down,” says T. Rowe Price's Timothy Parker, but "it won’t generally hurt the companies because very few have debt covenants that are linked to book value, which the writedowns affect."

The energy sector is an early leader in today's trading even after Standard & Poor's issued negative outlooks for Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.3%) and Chevron (CVX +1.9%) after Friday's close, citing high debt levels and low energy prices.XOM "has substantially more debt than during the last cyclical commodity price trough in 2009, while upstream production and costs are at similar levels,” S&P said, adding that “a sustained period of lower oil and gas prices will significantly reduce the company’s operating cash flow in 2015 and 2016 from 2014 levels, resulting in rising debt balances as the company sustains its capital investments and dividends.”The ratings agency anticipates CVX "will outspend internally generated cash flow to fund major project capital spending and dividends."While S&P stopped short of credit downgrades - it held CVX’s long-term credit rating at AA and XOM’s at AAA - it did downgrade 12 others: CHK, WLL, UPL, DNR, LINE, BBG, LGCY, TPLM, ARP, CWEI, MPO, EXXI.Outlooks also were lowered for NOG and EVEP.Ratings were affirmed for COP, WPX, WTI and CRK.

Chesapeake bonds sink on new debt leeway in amended revolver
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.6%) bonds plunge after the company announced an amendment to its existing $4B line of credit that would allow it to incur as much as $2B in junior debt.Under terms of the deal, CHK's existing credit line has become a secured credit facility, which can become unsecured again if the company meets certain conditions, which it does not disclose.CHK was able to extract some concessions from its lenders, such as the ability to incur new debt and the removal of the total leveraged ratio covenant.

Chesapeake Energy cuts workforce by 15%
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) discloses that it is laying off 15% of its total workforce, which would equal ~750 employees, as it attempts to cope with the lower oil price environment.In connection with the reduction, CHK estimates it will incur an aggregate of $55.5M in one-time charges during Q3.CHK -0.3% AH.

Investors still shorting energy names; Approach Resources short interest +77%
Sterne Agee CRT’s Tim Rezvan notes that investors are still shorting oil and gas stocks, especially Chesapeake Energy (CHK -5.6%), and have been rapidly increasing their short positions in Approach Resources (AREX -7.4%), Occidental Petroleum (OXY +0.7%) and Energen (EGN -0.4%).According to Rezvan, AREX had a 77% increase in short interest to 7.9M shares (19.6% of shares outstanding) since the end of August, OXY had an 18.9% increase to 17.9M shares (2.3% of shares outstanding), and EGN had an 8.4% increase to 3.7M shares (4.7% of shares outstanding).Short interest in CHK rose another 3M shares to 220.6M (33.1% of shares outstanding), the seventh consecutive increase.

Colder-than-normal winter would be good news for Chesapeake, others
Citigroup’s team expects a colder-than-normal winter, which it says would be good news for stocks such as Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), Eclipse Resources (NYSE:ECR), Rice Energy (NYSE:RICE) and Range Resources (NYSE:RRC).Citi's 2016 composite spot natural gas price forecast of $3.00/MMBtu is based on the assumption of normal weather going forward, but a 4% colder-than-normal winter, all else being equal, would lift its 2016 composite spot forecast to $3.20/MMBtu.But Citi says its outlook for much colder temperatures in the Northeast also carries the risk of hurting Appalachian and Utica producers if well freeze-offs and operational disruptions occur, as has often happened in the past during periods of extreme cold or harsh weather.

J.P. Morgan lists 25 non-financial stocks at risk if Fed raises rates
J.P. Morgan analysts warn that companies with large amounts of floating-rate debt - including Chesapeake Energy, Freeport McMoRan, Ford and GE - could be at risk if the Fed decides to raise interest rates.Companies with variable/floating-rate debt suffer a more immediate impact by a rate hike than companies with fixed-rate debt, the analysts say; variable-rate coupons typically reset quarterly, meaning that changes in the base rate flow through almost immediately to variable-rate borrowers, while fixed-rate borrowers do not see such an impact until they refinance or issue new debt.JPM lists 25 companies - not including financials - that have the “highest variable-rate debt as a percentage of market cap": FMC, NRG, FCX, AES, CVC, LVLT, PVH, CHK, FE, DVA, THC, OI, CNX, F, HCA, FOSL, RCL, JOY, GE, ADS, ALLE, HBI, GT, DNB, AN

Renegotiated deals such as Williams-Chesapeake seen worth the risk for MLP
Williams Cos. (WMB +1.4%) renegotiated contracts with Chesapeake Energy (CHK +5.3%) are supposed to be positive for WMB's EBITDA, but Amey Stone at Barron's says several MLP contracts likely will be rewritten in the coming months resulting in tougher terms for the midstream MLPs that provide the storage and transportation.Janney analyst Nathan Judge argues that such negotiations are healthy for the recovery of MLPs, saying the deals often will result in positive outcomes for the MLP and may be supportive for a recovery in the group as fears diminish.The MLP usually has the upper hand in contract renegotiations, Judge believes, as customers that wish to renegotiate must make it economically attractive to the MLP to make changes; also, if the customer expects to grow, it will need to incentivize the MLP to invest, which was clear from the WMB-CHK deal.

Chesapeake cuts deal to lower transportation costs for its natural gas
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +6.7%) surges higher after announcing a deal with Williams Cos. (WMB +1.4%) that will decrease its natural gas transportation costs in exchange for higher volume.The deal should help improve CHK's 2016 guidance by diminishing the issues of high transportation costs and minimum volume commitments that have weighed on the shares for nearly a year, Wunderlich's Jason Wangler says.The firm says it remains bullish on CHK’s assets and believes management "continues to navigate tough internal and external factors quite impressively."

Newer fracking methods offer potential for more and cheaper natural gas
Applying newer fracking techniques to the prolific Haynesville Shale natural gas region that straddles Louisiana and Texas could give the U.S. more and cheaper gas supplies for many years, WSJ reports.Experimental wells by explorers including Comstock Resources (NYSE:CRK) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) are proving highly profitable even at today’s depressed prices because of the sheer volume of fossil fuels that can be coaxed out of the ground.The results so far have been confined to a small area in a single Louisiana parish near the Texas border, but if the approach works across the entire Haynesville Shale, which spans 120 miles across both states, the era of low U.S. nat gas prices could continue for decades, experts say.The costs of fracking wells have fallen in the past year, especially in the Haynesville, the second-largest U.S. gas deposit behind the Marcellus.CRK says it could get a 30% return on its new wells even with gas at $2.50/MMBtu, and plans to drill more wells in the Haynesville than it will in the oily Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Sep. 1, 2015, 5:57 PM | 33 Comments
Not yet time to buy Chesapeake Energy, Citi says
Investors should stay away from Chesapeake Energy (CHK -0.7%), Citigroup analysts say, even though the stock has shown signs of life recently, up 30% since Aug. 25.CHK shares are down 60% YTD, the worst performing stock in the S&P 500, Citi says it is not yet time to buy; while CHK has some good assets and capable management, the firm continues to recommend investors stay on the sidelines until it delivers on its commitment to reduce leverage through several ongoing initiatives.Interestingly, in a day of broad declines led by the energy sector, CHK is down only modestly.

Goldman sees rebound ahead, lists 25 most oversold stocks
Goldman Sachs analysts say the U.S. stock market correction has many more parallels with 1998 than 2008, which “suggest[s] a rebound ahead,” while predicting the S&P 500 will rise by 11% from current levels to reach 2,100 by year's end.The S&P fell 19% between July and August 1998, but "ultimately, the U.S. economy was relatively unaffected by overseas financial market gyrations in 1998, and we believe a similar situation will occur in 2015," Goldman says.The correlation between U.S. economic growth and Chinese growth is relatively low, Goldman says, estimating that a one percentage point drop in Chinese growth would translate into a 0.06 pp reduction in U.S. GDP.The best strategy for U.S. consumers, the bank advises, is to hold companies with high domestic revenues and avoid companies with high foreign sales.Goldman's list of the 25 most oversold stocks with high U.S. sales exposure: KMX, M, WFM, CHK, SWN, RRC, COG, PXD, OKE, MPC, NAVI, ETFC, LNC, BXP, KEY, RF, DFS, ANTM, CSX, NSC, UNP, JBHT, FSLR, ADS, PAYX Aug. 25, 2015, 10:43 AM | 41 Comments
Another disastrous day for oil stocks - is it capitulation time?
Oil companies are bracing for "lower for longer” prices as a global supply glut persists, dragging U.S. crude to the lowest close since March 2009 at just above $42/bbl.More capitulation notes are out; Oppenheimer's Fadel Gheit wrote today that the "new normal" for oil in a recovery would be $65-$75, and that "the vast majority of oil companies are living beyond their means, with operating cash flow falling short of capital investments and dividend... Unless oil prices rebound significantly above future strip prices, oil stocks could sink further, as takeover premiums shrink with potential sellers significantly outnumbering potential buyers."The world’s biggest producers will need to trim investments by another $26B, Jefferies believes; capital spending will have to fall 10% next year, according to Banco Santander.CNBC's Bob Pisani says when energy stocks staged a brief bounce recently, investors repeated a frequent mistake: They tried to buy oil stocks ahead of a recovery in crude oil, instead of the other way around.The result today was heavy losses for many of the sector's big names: CHK -6.6%, MRO -5.4%, COP -2.8%, APC -2.4%, SWN -4.2%, RRC -4.4%, RIG -6.5%, DVN -3.9%, APA -2.6%, BHI -2.9%, CAM -3.5%.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, ERY, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, FENY, PXE, PXI, FIF, PXJ, NDP, RYE, FXN, DDG Aug. 13, 2015, 7:27 PM | 173 Comments
Chesapeake Energy still must improve its balance sheet, RBC says
Chesapeake Energy's (CHK -5.2%) stock price target is lowered by $2 to $14 at RBC Capital to reflect a wider discount to its net asset value in the current weak oil price environment, with the firm saying "more progress on the liquidity overhang is key to reaching NAV potential."RBC sees near-term opportunities for CHK such as outright sales of non-core gassy assets that could generate several hundred million dollars, while larger opportunities to improve the long-term financial structure include sales or JVs of emerging areas such as portions of the STACK and the PRB.

Icahn may see Cheniere as cash producing machine, some analysts say
Carl Icahn must still foresee plenty of profits to be made in the right energy investments, with his newly announced 8.18% stake in Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) coming after losing billions so far on his holdings in Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), CVR Energy (NYSE:CVI) and Transocean (NYSE:RIG).Cheniere soon will begin to throw off considerable cash flow as it prepares to export the first major amounts of U.S. natural gas by sea later this year from its $16B Sabine Pass terminal on Louisiana’s Gulf coast - but should the company start to return cash to shareholders through dividends, or should it continue to invest and grow?Cheniere recently revealed plans to further expand its Corpus Christi terminal and team up with another company on two mid-scale projects in Louisiana, even though it has not secured contracts for the full capacity of projects already announced.Heard On The Street's Liam Denning is among those who suggest Icahn may seek to push Cheniere to scale back its ambitions and focus on churning out cash for distribution from its existing contracts; Denning thinks the deal is not a bet on a gas price rally but that any recovery in oil would "turbocharge" Icahn's investment."Cheniere has a very aggressive expansion program and is building out more export capacity than any company in North America," Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov says, adding that Icahn may say “You guys have built enough, and now it’s time to give to shareholders instead of building more and more and more."While Icahn's plans are unclear, traders bid up the stock anyway after the news, apparently with the expectation that Icahn’s involvement will help push the stock price higher - even though results so far from his energy holdings contradict that notion.

Chesapeake -9.5% as CEO sees no significant price recovery ahead
An early sigh of relief evaporates as Chesapeake Energy (CHK -9.5%) shares plunge to new 12-year lows following its Q2 report and after CEO Doug Lawler said in this morning's earnings conference call that he does not expect any significant recovery in prices.The CEO also said CHK is in discussions with potential investors about cash-raising deals that could involve asset sales or drilling partnerships.Lawler said he is not worried about low energy prices deflating offers from potential partners, since any investors considering taking stakes in the company’s fields are focused on how much crude and gas they will yield and at how cheap a per-unit cost.CHK also said in the call that it is curtailing 275M cf/day of gas production in the Utica Shale through October.

Chesapeake Energy +2% premarket as investors breathe sigh of relief
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) +1.9% premarket after meeting Wall Street expectations with an $0.11/share Q2 loss on $3B in revenues that came in 41% less than a year ago but slightly better than estimates.On a GAAP basis, CHK reported a net loss of $4.15B, or $6.27/share, primarily due to a $3.67B drop in the carrying value due to the low prices for oil and natural gas; the drop was roughly the same size as CHK's Q1 drop in carrying value.CHK says its Q2 production averaged 703K boe/day, up 13% Y/Y and up 2% Q/Q, adjusted for asset sales, consisting of 119.5K barrels of oil, 3B cf of natural gas and 79.2K barrels of natural gas liquids, which represent respective Y/Y increases of 11%, 11% and 24%.Natural gas accounts for 72% of CHK's production, and the company's average realized price for natural gas for Q2 was $1.01/Mcf, down from $2.45 a year ago and $2.37 in Q1; the average realized price per barrel of oil was $67.91, down ~$17.50/bbl Y/Y but up more than $5 Q/Q.Operating cash flow at the end of Q2 was $606M, compared to $1.269B in the prior-year quarter.CHK revises its outlook for the rest of 2015, with total production now expected to rise 5%-7% to 667K-677K boe/day, up 4% from the midpoint of prior guidance.

WSJ's Jakab: Chesapeake’s dividend cut provides a buying opportunity
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) ended today's trade at another 52-week low ahead of tomorrow morning's Q2 earnings report, but the market’s extreme reaction to CHK’s recent dividend cut may have provided a buying opportunity.WSJ's Spencer Jakab, for one, is backing CHK's move to preserve cash with a potentially positive impact on future output as well as the company’s financial viability, and finds it "frustrating" that the cut was interpreted as a sign that things are worse than believed.While the price of natural gas remains weak and could cause further woes for CHK, but Q2 results should show that things the company actually can affect, such as efficiency, continue to improve, Jakab writes.CHK "remains far from distress and could sell more assets, but its exaggerated weakness may have brought a larger asset into play: the whole company," Jakab concludes.Analyst consensus for Q2 results calls for an $0.11/share loss vs. a $0.38 profit last year on revenue of $2.79B (-45% Y/Y).

Chesapeake upped to Buy at SunTrust, which sees potential for company sale
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +2.2%) is upgraded to Buy from Neutral with a $15 price target at SunTrust, in part because the firm sees the potential for a sale of the struggling company.SunTrust looks for CHK's share price to rebound with an additional asset sale, and sees the company potentially duplicating last year’s success by selling some non-core assets in the Powder River Basin or Mid-Continent South, with either possibly generating $500M-plus in proceeds, which could be used to take activity higher than the 9-19 rigs 2015 year-end forecast; the firm adds that it "would not be surprised to see an entire company sale."The firm does not see the nearly $7B in liquidity as an issue with a projected outspend of less than $1.5B this year, though CHK’s operating efficiencies appear to be getting buried in the current troubled commodity environment.

Chesapeake Energy playing defense, Credit Suisse says in downgrade
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -2%) is downgraded to Neutral from Outperform with a $13 price target, cut from $20, at Credit Suisse, which sees a company totally on the defensive and focusing on protecting its balance sheet rather than increasing its production and/or expanding its holdings.In an environment where operational efficiency has become critical, analyst Mark Lear considers CHK’s asset base sub-par and providing little cause for investment in such a weak oil and gas price environment.While Lear upgrades the energy E&P sector and issues high ratings for several individual stocks, he advises would-be CHK investors to "look elsewhere for investment in this environment and consider operators with core exposure and more flexible balance sheets that are capable of accelerating net asset value even at the strip."

Chesapeake dividend cut backfires for bonds
A dividend cut often is viewed favorably in the credit markets, but Chesapeake Energy's (CHK -7.3%) dividend suspension (I, II) is having the opposite effect on CHK bonds, which have lost ~$217M in market value so far today, as creditors may be unnerved about a cash balance that was lower than expected at the end of Q2.CHK’s $1B of 6.125% notes maturing in February 2021 have plunged nearly six cents to $0.875 on the dollar to yield 9%, Bloomberg reports."The message being sent out is that the next six months are going to be equally as difficult as the last six months," a Gimme Credit analyst says. "Bondholders are saying ‘Whoa, if the company has to cancel the dividend, I guess maybe things are bad.’”Goldman Sachs wonders why a company with nearly $3B of cash and a $4B untapped credit line at the end of Q1 would care so much about saving $240M/year at the risk of upsetting equity holders, and suggests CHK may not be able to cut costs as much as expected, or that earnings will miss expectations, or both.

Chesapeake Energy drops to 52-week lows after scrapping dividend
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -5.9%) tumbles to new 52-week lows after suspending its quarterly dividend for the first time in 14 years, while most energy names are moving higher in today's trade as crude oil prices rebound."More bold actions like this are needed,” says Oppenheimer's Fadel Gheit, adding that CEO Doug Lawler "has to throw a lot of things overboard to save the ship."The move is prudent to improve financial liquidity, RBC analysts say; Tudor Pickering echoes that view, adding that few investors buy CHK for its 3.4% dividend yield."Clearly, management believes that preservation of cash is more important than appeasing a beaten-down shareholder base’s desire for dividend income," says Sterne Agee CRT's Tim Rezvan, who also supports CHK's move; he recently upgraded CHK to Buy with a $13 price target.

Forbes: Chesapeake Energy suspiciously quiet on dividend
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.9%) appears to be in the process of quietly skipping its quarterly dividend, according to Forbes' Antoine Gara.CHK normally would have announced its dividend about six weeks ago and set its quarterly payout to shareholders of record, Gara writes, but the company last announced its $0.875 quarterly dividend on March 5.In order to produce the cash flow to service its debt and financial commitments to contractors, CHK needs to maintain its oil and gas production, meaning the dividend could be sacrificed, Gara writes.

A whole lot of shorting going on at Chesapeake Energy
Sterne Agee CRT’s Tim Rezvan reiterates his bullish views on Chesapeake Energy (CHK -3.1%), citing the latest short interest data which shows a 14.1% increase from mid-June to the end of June to 185M shares, 27.8% of shares outstanding and 8.1 days to cover; the increase in short interest increase from the end of February to the end of June was 163%.The firm upgraded CHK to Buy from Underperform on June 29, reflecting what it considered as oversold conditions, and Rezvan says the month-end short interest data validates the thesis and expect profit-taking from shorts to provide further support to CHK shares into Q2 earnings.The largest increase in short interest came from PetroQuest Energy (PQ +0.1%), which had a 16.1% increase to 7.2M shares (11% of shares outstanding, 5.0 days to cover); Noble Energy (NBL -1.1%) also showed a notable jump, with a 10.3% increase to 17.9M shares (4.6% of shares outstanding, 4.1 days to cover).CHK is sharply lower today, apparently in reaction to late Friday's court order for CHK to pay nearly $380M to bondholders.

Chesapeake's latest deal improves and simplifies balance sheet, analyst says
Chesapeake Energy’s (CHK +1.3%) decision to sell some assets to privately-held FourPoint Energy for $840M gets a thumbs-up from Wunderlich’s Jason Wangler, who says the deal should help improve the balance sheet while keeping the upside potential on CHK’s core assets.The deal likely reduces the balance and payments of its CHK Cleveland Tonkawa, Wangler says, as three tranches of payments come in as the deal is completed, and pricing looks "decent" given the current environment.Wunderlich says it likes CHK’s execution and believe so much has been made of the potential pitfalls that many forget the potential catalysts that could drive value, such as accretive acquisitions using the strong liquidity position, potential sales to further improve the balance sheet, and reducing its gathering and takeaway costs.

Chesapeake Energy (CHK -5.5%) agrees to sell assets in Oklahoma’s Western Anadarko Basin to privately-held FourPoint Energy for $840M.FourPoint will get interest in ~1,500 producing wells in western Oklahoma that produce an average 21.5K boe/day, split between oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas; the assets cover nearly 250K net acres of mineral rights.CHK had drilled and completed more than 190 horizontal wells in the acquisition area since 2012, and halted drilling there this Q1 in anticipation of selling the wells, FourPoint says.

Chesapeake Energy earns big upgrade from Sterne Agee
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) +1.2% premarket after Sterne Agee upgrades shares to Buy from Underperform with a $13 price target, saying the stock is "oversold," but that the issues facing the company are "not fatal."Shares have slipped 21% since March 18, and the firm's Tim Rezvan argues "investors would be late to the short-selling party at this level," as short interest has climbed to 162M shares vs. 661M shares outstanding and just 70M shares sold short at end February.CHK management has suggested recently that it is "aggressively pursuing" ways to continue to contract with Williams Cos. (NYSE:WMB) while making the obligating terms more effective; "we believe any positive traction on this front would ease investor angst on the current liquidity drain and reset CHK shares higher," Sterne Agee says.

Marathon Oil raised to Buy at UBS as inexpensive way to play oil recovery
While UBS downgraded Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.2%) and Murphy Oil (MUR -2.4%) today (I, II), the firm also upgrades Marathon Oil (MRO +1.4%) to Buy from Neutral with a $32 target price, finding MRO an attractive way to play its expectation for a long-term recovery in oil prices.UBS notes MRO's high oil exposure, above average debt-adjusted growth, leverage to low-cost resource in the Eagle Ford and SCOOP/STACK, strong balance sheet and inexpensive valuation vs. peers.The firm also says MRO is trading at a wider than normal discount to peers despite an above average cash flow per debt-adjusted share growth outlook.

Chesapeake Energy cut to Sell at UBS
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) -1.5% premarket after UBS downgrades shares to Sell from Neutral while also cutting its long-term normalized natural gas price forecast to $4.00/MMBtu from $4.50.CHK carries "far too much financial leverage," prompting a material reduction in activity that is contributing to a declining production profile in 2015-16, and the shares are expensive relative to peers, analyst William Featherston writes in cutting his price target for the stock to $11 from $16.

Oklahoma drilling regulator calls recent spike in quakes a "game changer"
A spike in earthquakes across Oklahoma is forcing the state's energy regulator to urgently consider tougher restrictions on drilling activity, calling it a "game changer."During the June 17-24 period, Oklahoma experienced 35 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey, with some of the quakes occurring in the Oklahoma City metro area where there are no high-volume wastewater injection wells.The spike in quakes comes two months after drillers were ordered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, to stop disposing wastewater below the state's deepest rock formation.Oklahoma's elected officials have been reluctant to shackle an industry that directly generated more than 7% of state revenues last year in the form of production taxes from companies such as Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), SandRidge Energy (NYSE:SD), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR).ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, ERY, DIG, DUG, BGR, IYE, IEO, FENY, PXE, FIF, PXJ, NDP, RYE, FXN, DDG Jun. 24, 2015, 6:57 PM | 52 Comments
NGL price plunge may add to oil and gas company pain, some analysts say
The strained finances at U.S. E&P shale companies caused by collapsing crude oil prices is well known, and some analysts say the pain may be compounded by a steep drop in prices for natural gas liquids caused by oversupply, partly due to infrastructure constraints.SM Energy (NYSE:SM) said yesterday the price it is receiving for NGLs at the Mont Belvieu delivery point fell 36% Q/Q to $16.67/bbl and that the price declines would lower its 2015 total budgeted revenue by ~$25M while not affecting its drilling or production.Barclays recently said Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) could see 2016 cash flow cut by up to 3% if NGL price weakness persists, while Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) may see its cash flow cut by up to 5%; APC, DVN, PXD, QEP, SWN, ECA and EOG also could see reduced cash flow related to NGL pricing, the firm said.Analysts at Tudor Pickering have a more optimistic view and expect an NGL pricing recovery next year, as cresting U.S. nat gas and crude production looks to be flat-to-declining through 2016, giving U.S. infrastructure time to catch up; the firm upgrades SWN to Accumulate from Hold, with GPOR, MRD, COG, RICE and ECA as other top picks, and UPL and EQT recommended on weakness.ETFs: UNG, UGAZ, DGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Jun. 16, 2015, 5:45 PM | 32 Comments
Chesapeake Energy downgraded at Oppenheimer on cash flow woes
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) is downgraded to Perform from Outperform at Oppenheimer to reflect the negative impact on earnings and cash flow from lower oil and gas prices and lower production as a result of asset sales and sharply lower capital spending.Oppenheimer expects CHK to report losses of $544M this year and $833M next year, or a respective $0.48/share and $0.84/share; the firm also projects operating cash flow of $2.1B this year and $1.5B next year.Assuming $3.7B capex, annual dividends of ~$230M and preferred dividends of ~$220M, Oppenheimer foresees free cash flow deficits of $2.1B for 2015 and $2.7B for 2016.CHK -1.2% premarket.

EPA fracking findings undercut environmentalists’ calls for regulation
Analysts say yesterday's release of a landmark EPA study that found fracking had no widespread impact on drinking water makes it less likely that the Obama administration or Congress will strip a 2005 exemption of fracking from drinking water laws and that the EPA will move to tighten rules on disclosure of the chemicals used and limits on the methane emitted."The EPA fracking study does not appear likely to spur additional federal water regulation beyond initiatives that are already in process," ClearView Energy Partners analyst Kevin Book writes.That’s seen as good news for companies such as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the largest oil services companies, as well as producers such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), as they weather lower oil and natural gas prices.The study "is absolutely consistent with all the previous studies that show that effective well containment practices make hydraulic fracturing a very safe practice,” XOM said after the report's release.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, ERY, FCG, DIG, GASL, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, IEZ, FENY, PXE, FIF, PXJ, NDP, RYE, FXN, DDG Jun. 5, 2015, 11:49 AM | 124 Comments
Chesapeake hits 52-week low amid biggest natural gas surplus in 12 years
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) hit a 52-week low today amid a double whammy of negative news concerning the natural gas market.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said storage levels grew by 132B cf in the week ended May 15 to 2.2T cf, 51% more than a year ago; the weekly surplus is the largest in 12 years and the second largest in EIA records that date back to 1994.Many analysts believe the oversupply eventually will push another fall in gas prices; "The market was ready for a large injection, but it's still extremely bearish," one said.Also, the Natural Gas Supply Association said in its 15th annual Summer Outlook assessment of the natural gas market that it expects production to set records and inflict downward pressure on prices compared with summer 2014."Even with record-setting demand expected, production is also projected to set summer records," says Bill Green, NGSA chairman and Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) VP of downstream marketing.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, ERY, FCG, DIG, GASL, DUG, BGR, IYE, FENY, FIF, PXJ, RYE, FXN, DDG Jun. 4, 2015, 6:32 PM | 43 Comments
Time to follow Icahn and buy Chesapeake Energy, Sterman says
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -3.8%) shares have been whacked by a third YTD as investors punish energy exploration firms that are considered likely to outspend their operating cash flow this year, but StreetAuthority's David Sterman thinks CHK appears poised to buck the consensus forecast this year and at least get to breakeven.CHK is "clearly healthier than it was a few years ago and is no longer at risk of a balance sheet blow up," Sterman writes, and its "strong base of real estate, coupled with impressive cost controls, could set the stage for a sharp spike in cash flow if energy prices rise from current levels."Sterman spots a subtle turnaround underway - one that appears to have prompted Carl Icahn to keep adding to his CHK position this year - as the company has cut the cost to develop and operate a well by ~30% in the past few years.

Chesapeake Energy downgraded at Alembic on "onerous" contracts

EIA: Marcellus Shale faces weakening output due to low gas prices
Natural gas production in the Marcellus shale, which has grown over the past decade from near zero to ~20% of U.S. output, may decline for the first time if prices in the basin remain low for much longer, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says."Relatively low gas prices, combined with low oil prices, have slowed drilling in the Marcellus so production from new wells is only offsetting the decline in old wells," EIA says, expecting Marcellus output to remain flat through 2018 before declining ~1%/year during 2019-25.Recent data indicates a potential slowdown: The number of rigs in the area has dwindled to its lowest since 2011, and drillers including Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) have temporarily shut in some production due to weak regional prices.An inability to move all the gas out of the Marcellus region has depressed prices there compared with the Gulf coast benchmark, the Henry Hub in Louisiana, making it less attractive for local producers to drill more.Other top Marcellus producers include RRC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, CVX, CNX, EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN, AR.

Chesapeake's Q1 earnings beat estimates, raises production outlook
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) +1.5% premarket after beating Q1 earnings estimates but falling well short on revenues, and slightly raising its oil and gas production forecast for the year.CHK posted adjusted EBITDA of $928M vs. $1.515B in the year-ago quarter, and cash flow fell to $910M from $1.614B, due mostly to lower realized oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices.CHK’s Q4 average realized price for oil was $62.57/bbl, down from $85.08 in last year's Q1 and $76.40 in Q4, natural gas prices fell $0.90/MMcf Y/Y and $0.65 Q/Q, and natural gas liquids prices fell $22.46/bbl Y/Y and $6.12 Q/Q.CHK says Q1 oil and gas production averaged 686K boe/day, up 14% Y/Y after adjusting for asset sales, and now expects output of 640K-650K boe/day following its earlier forecast of 635K-645K.CHK operated 54 rigs on average in the quarter, compared with 67 in Q4 and 60 in the prior-year period, and expects to finish 2015 with 35-45 rigs, down 38% from an average of 64 rigs in 2014 and the lowest total since 2004.Says Q1 average production costs totaled $4.84/boe, down 5% Q/Q and 2% lower Y/Y.Q1 capital spending rose 8.6% Y/Y to $1.49B; reiterates guidance for $3.5B-$4B in capex for the full year.

Study finds rising radon levels in Pennsylvania homes amid fracking surge
Radon levels have been rising measurably in Pennsylvania since 2004, when the fracking industry began drilling natural gas wells in the state, according to a new report by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.The report does not pinpoint the exact cause of rising radon readings or explicitly tie it to any activity, but it says that buildings in counties where natural gas is most actively being extracted have in the past decade had much higher radon measurements than buildings in low-activity areas, where no such discrepancies were found before 2004.Pennsylvania has long been known to have some of the highest indoor radon levels in the U.S., but the researchers say fracking of the Marcellus shale formation could exacerbate pathways for radon to enter buildings.Top Marcellus Shale producers include CHK, RRC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, COG, CVX, CNX, EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN, AR.

Investment-grade energy firms unlikely to default, Gimme Credit says
Despite the steep drop in energy prices, most investment-grade E&P companies face little risk of default because they are well-managed, diversified and have plenty of cash, according to analyst Philip Adams of bond rating firm Gimme Credit.Companies Adams believes are in strong positions - with a starting cash position greater than his estimated free cash flow deficit - include Suncor (NYSE:SU), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Hess (NYSE:HES) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC).Adams is “throwing in the towel" on only one company: WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX).He expects energy prices will rise this year due to less drilling, disruptions in countries such as Libya and new regulations that curtail fracking, but warns that the glut will worsen if Iran rejoins the market.

EIA: Oil production falling at Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara shale plays
Crude oil production at three major U.S. shale oil fields - the Eagle Ford in south Texas, the Bakken in North Dakota, and the Niobrara in Colorado and adjacent states - is projected to fall this month for the first time in six years, the Energy Information Administration says.Net production from the three fields is expected to drop by a combined 24K bbl/day, but overall losses likely will be masked by production gains in the Permian Basin in west Texas and other regions.It is one of the first signs that idling hundreds of drilling rigs and billions of dollars in corporate cutbacks are starting to affect the U.S. oil patch, but it also shows that drilling technology and techniques have advanced to the point that productivity gains may be negligible in some shale plays.Top Eagle Ford producers: EOG, BHP, COP, CHK, MRO, APC Top Bakken producers: CLR, EOG, WLL, HES, XOM, OAS, NOG, EOX, MRO Top Niobrara producers: NBL, APC, ECA, CHK, EOG, WPX Mar. 17, 2015, 7:40 PM | 37 Comments

Plenty of accretive options for Chesapeake Energy, analyst says
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.7%) is reiterated with a Buy rating and $24 price target at Wunderlich, which says the stock is at a 52-week low for what it believes are unfair reasons.The firm notes the concern about CHK remains its balance sheet despite asset sales and simplification that have put the company in a great position, and while CHK has an outspend for 2015, it should be easily funded by the $4B in cash currently on the books.Wunderlich also believes CHK's potential to make acquisitions in a depressed market and a $1B share repurchase program authorized late last year provide multiple avenues for CHK to add value, and now sees significant opportunity for investors at a compelling price.

Chesapeake Energy -13% in two days following Q4 earnings
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.1%) is sharply lower for a second straight day following disappointing Q4 earnings, as UBS downgrades shares to Neutral from Buy and cuts its price target to $19 from $24.The view is that CHK offered a "surprisingly weak outlook" for volumes and price realizations, and the company's adjustment to growth for Marcellus curtailments (+3%-5%) does not add up since CHK has little incremental contracted takeaway capacity in the future.Also, Jefferies reiterates its Hold rating but with a reduced stock price of $16, as it guides CHK's headline volumes to fall 7%-8% in 2015.However, Oppenheimer says the two-day decline is an overreaction to overspending; despite the big earnings miss, CHK has "one of the most attractive asset portfolios of any E&P company,” the firm says.

Despite progress, Chesapeake will continue to outspend cash flow in 2015
Chesapeake Energy's (CHK -9.5%) team of "value barbarians" has worked to bring the company's costs in line after years of overspending, but CHK will continue to outspend its cash flow in 2015, CEO Doug Lawler said in today's earnings conference call.CHK is forecasting weak pricing for the full year in the Marcellus Shale, and says it started shutting in ~250M cf/day in Marcellus natural gas production in December; CHK plans to run only one drilling rig in the area this year, down from five rigs operating there last year.On CHK's plans for the $5B it made on last year's sale of a big piece of its Marcellus and Utica gas business to Southwestern Energy, Lawler said CHK could use the money to pay down debt, fund its exploration program or acquire new properties or another company.CapitalOne analysts consider Q4 results soft, telling clients that CHK's "weaker than expected liquids pricing plus 2015 guidance for production" likely would drive Wall Street estimates lower.

Chesapeake Energy makes big cuts to 2015 capex, rig count
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) -4.4% premarket after reporting weaker than expected Q4 earnings and saying it will cut its 2015 spending and rig count in response to lower crude oil prices.CHK says it plans total capital spending of $4B-$4.5B in 2015, 37% lower at the midpoint than the $6.7B spent in 2014, and will operate only 35-45 rigs this year, the lowest number since 2004 and down from an average of 64 rigs in 2014.Even with the cutbacks, CHK forecasts 2015 oil and gas production to grow 3%-5% to 645K-655K boe/day.In Q4, CHK's average production increased 12% Y/Y to 729K boe/day, while revenue rose 11% to $5.05B and driven by 47% revenue growth in its natural gas, oil and natural gas liquid segment; operating expenses fell 4.7% to $4.09B.

Chesapeake Energy sues former CEO McClendon's new firm
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -0.7%) has filed suit alleging that founder and former CEO Aubrey McClendon stole confidential company data during his last months on the job in order to launch his new oil and gas company.CHK claims McClendon asked his assistant to print maps and data about unleased acreage and that McClendon also sent himself blind copies of the same documents at a personal email address during his last months at the company.CHK alleges that the information was used by McClendon and American Energy Partners to acquire drilling rights on land in the Utica Shale formation in four separate transactions.

Pennsylvania governor proposes new tax on nat gas extraction
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf is proposing a new 5% severance tax on natural gas extraction in the state, saying the measure could generate $1B or more.The measure could face some pushback in the state's Republican-controlled legislature, but some kind of fracking tax could pass, as lawmakers from both parties already have proposed taxes from 3.2% to 8%.Like other major natural gas producing states, Pennsylvania already has a severance tax on the value of the gas extracted at the wellhead.Top Marcellus Shale producers include CHK, RRC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, COG, CVX, CNX, EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN, AR.

Wunderlich lists potential energy movers with strong balance sheets
Figuring the debt markets are a bit more rational than the equity markets right now, Wunderlich analysts look to the bond market for some clues about energy investing.The firm finds that where Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE:CHK) debt is trading now as "quite refreshing" given the strong balance sheet the company has built, strengthening its conviction that CHK is a Best idea among oil stocks; others holding up well, it says, are financially strong names such as XEC, CXO, EGN, EOG, GPOR, MTZ, NBL, PTEN, PDCE, PXD and ROSE.In other cases, the debt is providing “equity-like returns” for investors who want to move out of stocks and into bonds, with the firm mentioning AREX, BBG, CWEI and NOG.

Chesapeake Energy to pay $119M in Oklahoma royalty case
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) agrees to pay $119M under a preliminary settlement with Oklahoma mineral rights owners who accused the company of improper royalty payments dating back to 2004.Landowners accused CHK of improperly withholding royalty money and charging them for the costs of processing and transporting gas; the class action lawsuit affects more than 11,800 wells in Oklahoma.CHK has faced similar lawsuits in Pennsylvania and other places where it operates.

Chesapeake stands apart from peers, as Credit Suisse upgrades
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +0.3%) is upgraded to Outperform from Neutral with a $24 price target, up from $21, at Credit Suisse, which cites attractive relative valuation, a much improved balance sheet that has investment grade qualities, and the firm's expectation that CHK could utilize its newly found financial strength to make a counter-cyclical M&A transaction to upgrade its asset base.The firm says CHK's increase in its net asset value reflects the accretive nature of the recent Marcellus asset sale to Southwestern Energy, which was “the key transformative deal" for CHK and has the potential to “meaningfully enhance the company’s credit" and leaves CHK’s balance sheet as one of the strongest in the peer group.Credit Suisse's upgrade comes even as the firm downgrades several energy names, including Exxon and Chevron.

Chesapeake Energy bumps up after M&A chatter
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +1.9%) moves higher as a report speculates that the company could be a potential acquisition target of India's ONGC.India's government has directed state-run ONGC to make some acquisitions to hedge themselves against higher energy prices in the future, and reportedly considers CHK a strong strategic target, given its recent sales, balance sheet and diversification through two commodities.The report says ONGC could already be in talks with a North American gas and oil company, with CHK believed to be the target.

Bill Nygren likes Chesapeake Energy and GE
"If you think the long-term price of oil is going to be $45 per barrel, there's basically nothing in this sector it makes any sense to own," Oakmark Funds' Bill Nygren tells CNBC, but he quickly adds he doesn't expect that. Checking futures out five years, the price is $70 per barrel, and a look at cost of production - near $70 - means production is going to be shutting down at current prices.One energy sector pick is Chesapeake Energy (CHK +5%). There's a stale perception of the stock, says Nygren, of a company designed to grow the top line as much as possible. But new management is laser-focused on maximizing rate of return, and their work at deleveraging the balance sheet is now allowing buybacks.Nygren's also liking General Electric (GE -0.4%), noting its underperformance - nearly 2000 basis points over the past year - and discounted valuation means the company only has to be average for the stock to go up. He also takes note of the new CFO as changing the focus to cash returns rather than reported earnings. Jan. 14, 2015, 3:49 PM | 14 Comments
Barclays cuts E&P sector, says oil price recovery expectations could disappoint
Barclays downgrades the large-cap E&P sector to Negative from Neutral and the small- and mid-cap E&P group to Negative from Positive, arguing that downside risk outweigh potential gains even if oil prices recover.Equity investors are pricing in WTI crude assumptions of close to $75/bbl in 2016 compared to current strip prices of ~$57, Barclays says, also noting that an abundance of relatively cheap oil supply from U.S. producers could further delay a price recovery.Among specific names, the firm downgrades CHK, SD, REN and HK to Underweight; DVN, CLR, KOS, MRO, RSPP and WLL are cut to equal weight.At the same time, Barclays picked a few favorites, upgrading Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) to Overweight from Equal Weight, and maintained Overweight ratings on large-cap E&P companies CNQ, EOG and NBL; among small- and mid-cap E&P names, the firm favors AR, CXO and XEC.ETFs: XOP, IEO, PXE Jan. 14, 2015, 2:35 PM | 9 Comments
Short sellers moving in on oil companies
Traders smelling blood - or oil - in the water have piled into shorts against energy E&P companies, with short interest jumping a total of 12% for the final two weeks of 2014, according to Sterne Agee analysts using NYSE data.Oasis Petroleum (NYSE:OAS) led a 45.9% jump in short interest, followed by Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) with a 45.2% increase and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) short growth of 31.9%.Sterne Agee energy analyst Tim Rezvan thinks the shorts are on the right side of the oil trade for the foreseeable future, believing a break below $40/bbl "wouldn't be a surprise in the short term."Short positions did not increase for all companies, as short growth fell for Viper Energy Partners (NASDAQ:VNOM), Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE), Energen (NYSE:EGN) and PetroQuest Energy (NYSE:PQ), among others.

Goldman: "Shale sale" make Chesapeake Energy, Parsley Energy winners
Goldman Sachs upgrades a few energy stocks even as it cast a pall of gloom over most of the sector today (I, II, III), raising Chesapeake Energy (CHK -3.6%) to Buy from Neutral and Parsley Energy (PE -4.2%) to Neutral from Sell as potential "shale sale" winners.Despite PE's relative vulnerability to lower oil prices because of its weak balance sheet and negative projected free cash, Goldman has more confidence that its core Permian Basin position makes it an attractive M&A target.Among potential "shale scale" winners - companies that either can build positions in the core and reduce costs of capital - the firm's favorites remain EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Range Resources (NYSE:RRC), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) and Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO).However, Goldman cuts Bill Barrett (BBG -8.3%) to Sell from Neutral, seeing greater downside risk to its production in a lower oil price environment, and lowers Eclipse Resources (ECR -1.5%) to Neutral from Buy due to a persistently wide funding gap through 2017 coupled with a weak balance sheet.

Cost to insure energy bonds has nearly tripled since June
Energy bonds have become one of the riskiest sectors in the bond market, as the cost of buying five-year credit default swaps protecting $10M of bonds has jumped from $139K/year last June to $377K today for companies in the S&P/ISDA CDS U.S. Energy Select 10 Index.The index consists of 10 large major energy companies: APC, APA, CHK, COP, DVN, OTCQB:FSTO, HAL, BTU, VLO and WMB.Even though most of the companies boast investment-grade ratings, it now costs more to insure bonds in that index against default than it costs to insure bonds of an average junk-rated company, according to S&P.

Natural gas disappoints investors seeking oil refuge
A warm start to winter is disappointing investors who bet U.S. natural gas producers would offer a refuge from falling oil prices, as gas futures settled at a two-year low $2.882/MMBtu yesterday after dropping 32% in 2014.Among the 10 worst performers on the S&P’s Exploration & Production Index since June 20 - when oil was $107.26/bbl and gas was $4.53 - seven are companies that produce more than 50% gas; since June 20, Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.3%) has declined 37%, Range Resources (RRC -0.7%) has dropped 41%, and Southwestern Energy (SWN -1.6%) has plunged 45%.The gas market “looks terrible” for 2015 and “has been structurally oversupplied for years," Raymond James analyst Marshall Adkins says as he cuts his forecast for average 2015 Henry Hub gas prices to $3/Mcf from $3.65, citing normal weather that will “unmask the bearish underpinning of the U.S. gas market."ETFs: UNG, DGAZ, UGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, DCNG Jan. 6, 2015, 10:59 AM | 19 Comments

Southwestern's price paid for Chesapeake assets looks rich, analysts say
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +7.9%) and Southwestern Energy (SWN -2.2%) are headed in opposite directions today after SWN's $5.4B price tag on its purchase of Marcellus Shale assets from CHK is the most the company has ever paid in an acquisition.At ~$13K/acre, CHK's 413K net acres, wells and equipment fetched a price that energy producers typically have been paying for land soaked in oil, not gas, analysts say; SWN "paid literally 2x or 3x times more than any gas deal we’ve seen in the last few years... 20% higher than anyone would have thought,” according to Wunderlich's Jason Wangler.In a conference call today, SWN CEO Steve Mueller said the company believes the acreage has more than enough potential to grow to a size that would justify the high price, and investors will see “significant cash flow in just a few years.”Sterne Agee's Tim Rezvan says the deal proved recent speculation on CHK's ability to close its previously announced sale to SWN unfounded and opens up CHK's road to investment grade credit.

Natural gas -9.5% following mild weather forecast, bearish inventory views
Natural gas prices fall 9.5% to near two-year lows at $3.133/mmBtu, in the biggest one-day percentage loss since February and the lowest intraday price since January 2013, on mild weather forecasts and inventory that is above year-ago levels.Prices are now down more than 15% in three straight losing sessions and are 30% lower than the six-month high closing price of $4.489/mmBtu it hit just a month ago.Weather has been unseasonably warm for December, limiting demand for home heating and allowing relatively low stockpiles to catch up to where they were a year ago and encouraging traders to sell based on the belief that supply is relatively healthy.Gas producers are among the biggest early decliners: XOM -1.1%, CHK -7.3%, APC -2.6%, SWN -6%, DVN -2.2%, COP -2.3%, BP -1.5%, COG -4%, BHP -1.9%, CVX -1.3%, ECA -5.1%, EQT -4.3%, RDS.A -1.7%, UPL -12%, WPX -6.9%, EOG -1%, OXY -1.1%, RRC -6.1%, APA -2.3%, AR -3.2%, CNX -3%, QEP -4.8%, LINE -4.9%, NBL -1.6%, SM -2.6%, XEC -4.2%, PXD -2.9%, NFX -5.1%.ETFs: UNG, DGAZ, UGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, NAGS, DCNG Dec. 22, 2014, 10:45 AM | 47 Comments
Oil's drop has punished Icahn, Paulson
Even some of Wall Street's big boys are taking a beating in the oil sector: Carl Icahn’s holdings of Talisman Energy (NYSE:TLM) have tumbled $230M since late August, and John Paulson’s firm had one of its largest losses of the year on a bet that big oil companies would buy smaller ones.Before TLM agreed to be bought by Repsol, which boosted TLM shares, Icahn's losses stood at more than $540M as recently as Dec. 11, and he still will have lost ~$290M at the deal price; Icahn also holds stakes in hard-hit Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Transocean (NYSE:RIG).Paulson was the biggest shareholder in Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) and Oasis Petroleum (NYSE:OAS) at the end of Q3, but his strategy could yet pay off, as many analysts expect consolidation in the energy sector as lower oil prices pressure smaller firms.Also caught flat-footed by the oil price pullback was Prosperity Capital’s Mattias Westman, a longtime investor in Russia whose firm has lost more than $1B this year, in part on stakes in Russian energy companies Gazprom (OTCPK:OGZPY) and Lukoil (OTCPK:LUKOY, OTC:LUKOF).

New York state to ban fracking, citing health concerns
New York Gov. Cuomo's administration says it will ban fracking statewide, citing health concerns and what it considers as limited economic benefits to drilling.NY's acting health commissioner said at a cabinet meeting in Albany today that studies on fracking’s effects on water, air and soil are inconsistent, incomplete and raise too many “red flags” for the state to allow it; the state Department of Environmental Conservation will now issue a legally-binding recommendation prohibiting fracking.The state has had a de facto moratorium on fracking for more than six years, so nothing really changes with today's decision.Parts of New York sit atop the gas-rich Marcellus shale formation, whose top producers include CHK, RRC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, COG, CVX, CNX, EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN, AR.

Energy insiders buy most shares since 2012
With valuations at a decade low, oil execs such as Chesapeake Energy’s (NYSE:CHK) Archie Dunham and Ring Energy's (NYSEMKT:REI) Tim Rochford are driving the sector's biggest wave of insider buying since 2012, according to Bloomberg data.Rochford and two other board members bought a total of more than 30K REI shares over the past month; the CEO says the company can stay profitable even should oil slip to $50/bbl.“Most of these execs that are buying have been in the industry as long as I have, so they know how supply and demand works and they’re buying quality stocks,” says Dunham, who recently bought 500K CHK shares in his biggest purchase since joining the company’s board in 2012.Loews Corp. (NYSE:L), which owns about half of Diamond Offshore (NYSE:DO), bought 1.18M DO shares in November and bought another ~410K shares last week.Halcon Resources (NYSE:HK) and Goodrich Petroleum (NYSE:GDP) are among companies operating in the costliest U.S. shale-producing regions, but execs from those companies are buyers as well.

Eagle Ford produces billionth barrel of oil
The Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas produced its billionth barrel of oil some time last month, according to analysts at research firm Wood Mackenzie.Eagle Ford now accounts for 16% of total U.S. oil production, and the firm forecasts E&P spending of $30.8B in the region next year, ~22% of the total $139.3B expected in U.S. onshore spending.Eagle Ford is widely considered the most profitable U.S. shale field, and many analysts speculate the break-even price for production to remain profitable is ~$50/bbl in much of the play.Top Eagle Ford producers include EOG, CHK, COP, MRO, BHP, APC, APA, BP, COG, CRZO, CWEI, CRK, XOM, GDP, HES, MTDR, MUR, NFX, PVA, PXD, ROSE, RDS.A, RDS.B, SN, SM, STO, SFY, TLM, ZAZA Dec. 5, 2014, 5:38 PM | 19 Comments
Chesapeake Energy loses bond dispute appeal
A federal appeals court says Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.1%) had no right to redeem $1.3B of notes early because it waited too long to tell investors of its plans, reversing a 2013 ruling by a district court.The 2-1 decision agrees with Bank of New York Mellon, the notes' trustee, that the notice from CHK to redeem its 6.775% notes maturing in 2019 was untimely, referring the case back to the district court.

U.S. shale producers stare down Saudis as oil price war deepens
U.S. companies in shale fields from North Dakota to Texas are talking tough in the face of Saudi Arabia's price war, believing they have more staying power than many of the OPEC partners.“Saudi Arabia is really taking a big gamble. If they take the price down to $60-$70, you will see a slowdown in the U.S. but you’re not going to see it stop. The consequences for other OPEC countries are far more dire," says Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) chairman Archie Dunham.Execs at several large U.S. shale producers, including CHK, EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) said as they reported earnings that they plan to maintain and even raise production.Shale producers cite success in reducing costs as proof they can still be profitable at prices below $70/bbl; CHK says well costs at its two largest production areas - Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale and Texas' Eagle Ford - fell 11% and 13% respectively Y/Y during the first seven months of this year.But not all shale is alike: Bakken and Permian producers need prices at ~$67 and $65, respectively, to make drilling worthwhile, according to ITG Investment Research, while producers at the Cana Woodford shale in Oklahoma need $100 to make a profit, and $79 is the threshold at the Anadarko formation on the Texas-Oklahoma border.

Chesapeake Energy racks up strong Q3 beat as production rises
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) +3.8% premarket after Q3 earnings easily beat Wall Street estimates, posting a 17% Y/Y increase in revenues driven by 48% revenue growth in its natural gas, oil and natural gas liquid segment as production increased.Q3 production averaged 725.6K boe/day, up 11% Y/Y, adjusted for asset sales; oil production rose 5% to 118.9K bbl/day, production of natural gas liquids jumped 14% to 95.9K bbl/day, and natural gas production gained 3% to 3.1B cf/day.Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt had estimated CHK's Q3 production at 704K boe/day, and characterize the results as a "strong beat."For the full year, CHK estimates production to rise 9%-12%, with liquids production up 29%-33%, oil production up 11%-15%, NGL production up 63%-68%, and natural gas production up 4%-6%. The daily equivalent total is expected to be 695 million to 705 million barrels a day. Nov. 5, 2014, 9:17 AM

Chesapeake Energy upgraded to Buy at UBS
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +3.3%) is upgraded to Buy from Neutral with a $27 price target, up from $24, at UBS, which says new CEO Doug Lawler has removed most of the firm's bear arguments concerning high leverage, lack of transparency, and material free cash flow outspend.CHK's turnaround is not reflected in discounted valuation, the firm says, adding that high leverage has been reduced, visibility has increased, and free cash flow deficit has been narrowed.Given CHK's strong liquidity, below average oil inventory and attractive market valuations, UBS believes CHK may pursue an acquisition targeting oil-weighted U.S. resource assets.

Southwestern paid too much for Chesapeake assets, analysts say
Southwestern Energy (SWN -10.6%) appears to be paying a steep price to buy $5.375B in high quality Appalachia assets from Chesapeake Energy (CHK +16.7%); SunTrust estimates SWN paid $9,625/acre for the land, when previous deals in West Virginia had come in below $5K/acre and the sharp decline in commodity prices over recent months.Stock investors clearly think CHK got a great deal, which is boosting shares of other West Virginia players such as Magnum Hunter (MHR +9.9%), Gulfport Energy (GPOR +6.7%) and Consol Energy (CNX +2.5%).Topeka Capital believes MHR has superior assets in the core Utica and Marcellus, and an average of the transaction metrics on MHR's production and acreage implies upside of 39.2%; with its scale in the area, the firm thinks MHR makes for an attractive takeout over the next 12 months.

Chesapeake Energy to face racketeering charges in Michigan trial
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +0.5%) must face trial on charges of felony racketeering and using false pretenses related to its land-leasing practices, a Michigan state judge rules.The Michigan AG brought the charges against CHK in June, alleging the company directed its agents to lock up land positions in the state during the state's 2010 oil and gas leasing boom by offering signing bonuses to private landowners.CHK says it believes the charges are without merit and expects to prevail at trial.

Still $90B to be made in Marcellus shale, report says
The Marcellus region is now the world's biggest natural gas shale play, and there’s still $90B to be made by tapping the area’s reserves, according to a study by Wood Mackenzie.The energy consultant predicts that the top 20 operators in the Marcellus will earn nearly $86B over the life of the play after the costs of reaching the reserves; for comparison, it estimates ~$118B to be made by extracting the resources in North Dakota’s Bakken region, but most production there is higher-priced oil.Major Marcellus shale producers include CHK, RRC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, COG, CVX, CNX, EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN, AR.

Shale producers' improving finances lift growth hopes
Cash earned from operations by 25 leading North American E&P companies is expected in aggregate to exceed their capital spending next year for the first time since 2008, according to a Financial Times analysis.
Shale companies' finances have improved rapidly as a result of a shift by many away from natural gas towards more lucrative oil production and a pick-up in natural gas prices after they fell to 10-year lows in 2012.
Analysts’ consensus forecasts now indicate that the leading shale companies’ operating cash flows in 2015 will show an excess of ~$2.4B over their capital spending vs. a shortfall of $32.2B in 2012 and $8.8B last year.
Case in point: Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) in 2012 had capital spending almost $12B ahead of its cash flow from operations, but this year and next it is expected to be able to cover its spending almost entirely from its income.

Chesapeake upgraded at Stifel as production growth outlook improves
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1.1%) is upgraded to Buy from Hold with a $34 price target at Stifel, which says Q2 earnings confirm its view that CHK is becoming well positioned from a capex efficiency perspective heading into 2015.The firm thinks the stock's current attractive valuation, combined with CHK's increasingly cleaned-up and simplified balance sheet and the recent correction in gas prices and equities, provide a fine entry point heading into what it sees as a positive production growth and capex efficiency trajectory in H2 and above consensus expectations for 2015 production growth.

Chesapeake earnings slide along with nat gas liquids prices
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) -3.3% premarket after missing Q2 earnings estimates, hurt by a loss on the repurchase of debt securities related to a refinancing and lower prices for natural gas liquids.However, CHK raises its midpoint of 2014 production outlook by 10K boe, or 1.5%, to 685K-705K boe/day, attributable to better production trends in H1 and an expected increase in well connections during H2.Q2 oil and natural gas production, adjusted for asset sales, totaled 694,650 boe/day, up 13% Y/Y, consisting of ~113K bbl/day of oil, 84.3K bbl/day of NGL and 3B cf/day of natural gas.Q2 production of natural gas liquids rose 72% but the average price CHK received in the quarter fell 13% to $21.03/bbl.

Marcellus natural gas production hits record high exceeding 15B cf/day
Natural gas production in the Marcellus region exceeded 15B cf/day in July, the most productive period ever recorded there, according to a new report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Marcellus, located mostly in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, now accounts for nearly 40% of total U.S. shale gas production, and its rapid growth isn’t expected to ebb soon, the report says.New wells in the region are expected to deliver another 600M cf/day, more than offsetting decline rates, for a net production increase of 247M cf/day.Major Marcellus shale producers include CHK, RRC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, COG, CVX, CNX, EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN.

Court says Chesapeake must face trial on bid-rigging in Michigan lease sale
A judge in Michigan has ruled that Chesapeake Energy (CHK -1%) must face a criminal trial on a charge of bid-rigging with Encana at a 2010 state land lease auction, citing evidence of a conspiracy between the companies that drove state lease prices down sharply.The court cited evidence including an email sent by a top ECA exec to a land man bidding on ECA’s behalf on the morning of a 2010 auction which refers to a lease area on offer, stating that “this is a Chesapeake area and we will not be bidding.”The ruling said evidence did not support a trial on two other charges involving private landowners, since although the companies discussed a deal to avoid competing for private land leases, they did not consummate one.

Natural gas at six-month lows on cooler weather outlook, Chesapeake -4.7%
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -4.7%) suffers sharp losses as natural gas prices tumble to their lowest in nearly six months after weather forecasts over the weekend showed lower than expected temperatures ahead.Cooling patterns expected to hit the U.S. midwest and northeast over the next 6-10 days have investors betting utilities won't need to burn as much natural gas in the weeks ahead, as summer demand for electricity to run air conditioners eases.The absence of extreme heat has helped chip away at a record natural gas shortage following last year's unusually severe winter; last week, the EIA reported an eighth consecutive week of producers adding more than 100B cu. ft. of natural gas to storage.ETFs: UNG, DGAZ, UGAZ, BOIL, GAZ, FCG, GASL, KOLD, UNL, GASX, NAGS, DCNG Jul. 7, 2014, 3:59 PM | 7 Comments

New research links surge in Oklahoma earthquakes to drilling activity
A recent surge of low-magnitude earthquakes in Oklahoma probably is the result of the underground disposal of vast quantities of wastewater generated by oil and gas extraction, according to a new study published today in the journal Science.The researchers also calculated that four of the highest-volume wells in Oklahoma are capable of triggering ~20% of recent central U.S. quakes, and found that such induced quakes could potentially occur more than 30 km from the well.The Cornell geophysics professor who led the study says the results suggest regulators and oil companies should avoid disposing of wastewater near major faults and do a better job monitoring the activity.Among energy firms with a significant Oklahoma presence: CHK, CLR, APA, DVN, SD, EOG, MRO, OKE, OKS, GPOR, WPX, WMB, WPZ, LPI, CWEI, NFX, NGL, COG, WLL, NBL, MPO, PQ, XEC.

New York cities win right to ban fracking
New York’s cities and towns can block fracking within their borders, the state’s highest court rules, upholding the dismissal of lawsuits challenging bans in two small upstate towns.The ruling could lead the oil and gas industry to abandon fracking in New York, or it could mean that a patchwork of rules eventually may govern whether exploration can take place across the state; the case also may invigorate local challenges to the practice in states across the U.S.Parts of New York sit above the Marcellus Shale, some of whose top producers are: CHK, RRC, RDS.A, RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, COG, CVX, CNX, EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN.

Michigan charges mount against Chesapeake
Michigan's AG files another 12 charges in its land-leasing case against Chesapeake Energy (CHK +2.1%), bringing the total number of counts filed against CHK to 20 counts of false pretenses and conducting a criminal enterprise.According to the complaint, land options in northern Michigan were obtained to keep competing companies from leasing, and the leases later were canceled when competition for land ended.Encana last month agreed to pay $5M to settle civil litigation over its leasing activities and to not contest a charge it tried to collude with CHK, which has denied all charges.

Aubrey McClendon is back in the big leagues with $4.2B in new deals
Mac is back, as former Chesapeake Energy (CHK) CEO Aubrey McClendon's American Energy Partners announces $4.2B in acquisitions across shale formations in Texas, West Virginia and Ohio.The biggest deal is a ~$2.5B acquisition of ~63K net acres of oil and gas properties in Texas' southern Permian Basin from Enduring Resources.In two other acquisitions totaling $1.75B, he’s acquiring 27K net acres (with 40M cf/day of natural gas production) in the Utica shale region of Ohio, and he’s taking 48K acres (with 135M cf/day of nat gas production) in the Marcellus shale of West Virginia, both from Shell's (RDS.A, RDS.B) East Resources division and an unnamed private company.“He’s making bets on the same type of assets he did at Chesapeake," Oppenheimer's Fadel Gheit says.

Barron's: EOG's focus on oil production could keep its shares climbing
EOG Resources' (EOG +1.1%) crude oil production surged 42% in Q1, and if business stays on course, as expected, the E&P company could enjoy a 32% jump in earnings this year, according to a weekend profile in Barron's.EOG's enterprise value is 6.9x this year's estimated EBITDA, roughly in line with the EV/EBITDA multiples accorded competitors Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Devon Energy (DVN), but the story says it deserves a loftier multiple than the group, given its significant drilling inventory, superior production growth, lower debt ratio, and 15.6% return on equity vs. an average of 9.5% among peers.EOG raised its 2014 goal for growth in crude oil production to 29% from a prior 27%, and for total energy production to 12% from an earlier 11.5%, but its estimates often prove conservative, sparking expectations for more upward revisions as the year unfolds.

Coal producers mixed on EPA plan, Walter Energy -6% despite statement
Walter Energy (WLT -6.3%) shares aren't helped by the coal producer's statement that new EPA proposals aimed at controlling carbon emissions from U.S. power plants should have no material impact on the company; in fact, WLT is down more than peers: CNX +1.1%, BTU +0.1%, CLD -0.3%, ACI -2.8%, ANR -4.6%.Long-term losers also will include electric companies that burn lots of coal - such as American Electric Power (AEP +0.1%), Duke Energy (DUK -0.3%), Southern Co. (SO -0.3%) and NRG Energy (NRG -0.1%) - but stiff regulations have been expected for some time.Likely winners include companies that pump natural gas and those that use it as their primary fuel, such as Calpine (CPN +0.3%), and companies that operate nuclear plants that generate little carbon but have been expensive to run, such as Exelon (EXC -1%), hope that their aging plants will become more competitive.A reduction in coal-fired capacity would increase utilities' demand for natural gas by 3B-10B cf/day from 22B cf/day now, potential benefiting major natural gas producers like Chesapeake Energy (CHK +2.1%), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG -0.8%) and Range Resources (RRC -0.6%).ETFs: XLE, XLU, TAN, ERX, KOL, IDU, VDE, OIH, ERY, FCG, VPU, DIG, GASL, DUG, IYE, GASX, PXJ, FENY, RYE, UPW, FUTY, RYU, FXN, FXU, DDG, SDP Jun. 2, 2014, 3:31 PM | 26 Comments
Oklahoma governor signs bill raising energy output tax
Oklahoma Gov. Fallin signed legislation yesterday that will raise taxes on the state's oil and gas wells but was supported by the state's largest oil and gas producers, Devon Energy (DVN), Continental Resources (CLR) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK).The new law takes effect in 2015 and will tax energy companies at a 2% rate on a well's oil and gas output for the first three years of its life; after that, the tax rate rises to 7%.Critics say the higher rate still falls short of what's needed to help fund education and infrastructure improvements.

Chesapeake Energy (CHK +2.1%) is fighting back against collusion charges, accusing Michigan authorities of cherry picking internal documents to support their contention it colluded with Encana (ECA -0.9%) in dividing up oil and gas lease bids in the state.Michigan authorities have charged the companies with driving down the price of oil leases by conspiring over which counties each would seek resource exploration rights during a May 2010 auction.Among the evidence the state's lawyers say back up their accusations are CHK e-mails suggesting the firms "throw in 50/50" on the bids, but in new court filings, CHK cites other parts of the same e-mails to show former CEO Aubrey McClendon was open to competition.

Western companies win new deal offers from oil nations, but will they come?
Mexico, Iran and other countries that once played hardball with big oil companies are now rolling out the welcome mat, offering generous deals in the hope they will bring capital to stimulate output.But it isn't certain the big oil firms will want to return to all those countries, as the economics of the oil business may be changing to favor different kinds of exploration projects elsewhere in the world, WSJ reports.The biggest shake-up is coming in Mexico, where production has been falling steadily while rising electricity demand has forced dependency on imported natural gas and sent prices soaring; Total (TOT), Chesapeake (CHK) and Chevron (CVX) have expressed interest in entering the country.Iran is considering big changes to its current stringent oil terms, but some analysts say "it will be a slow process to get Western oil companies back to Iran... Iran's reservoirs are prolific, but they are also complex and in poor shape."Also, he Ukraine crisis has reinforced the trend in thinking about geopolitical risk as being a big factor.ETFs: XLE, ERX, VDE, OIH, ERY, FCG, XOP, DIG, GASL, DUG, XES, IYE, IEO, IXC, IEZ, GASX, PXE, IPW, PXJ, BARL, PXI, PSCE, FENY, RYE, FXN, GNAT, DDG, IOIL, FILL May 19, 2014, 7:17 PM | 7 Comments

Chesapeake to spin off Oilfield Services Business, divest other assets
Ahead of its investor day, Chesapeake (CHK) says it plans to spin off its Oilfield Services Business to shareholders in a tax-free transaction that will remove $1.1B in debt from the parent company's balance sheet.The division will be renamed Seventy Seven Energy and will grant Chesapeake a dividend of $400M to repay inter-company debt.Chesapeake also intends to divest its ownership of CHK Cleveland Tonkawa, which will improve its balance sheet, mostly by eliminating $1B of equity attributable to third parties.In addition, Chesapeake has agreed to sell various non-core assets for $600M.The transactions will lead to a net leverage reduction to Chesapeake of nearly $3B but only lower its 2014 output by 2% and its operating cash flow by $250M. The deals will also cut Chesapeake's 2014 interest expense and dividend payments by $70M and eliminate $200M of projected capex.Following these deals, Chesapeake expects 2015 production to grow 7-10% and capex of $5.5-6B.

Natural gas is Wall Street's bet on climate change
Wall Street’s idea of investing in climate change means investors are piling into natural gas - the least polluting fossil fuel - as energy have accounted for nearly two-thirds of the $8B of inflows into sector-based ETFs this year.A White House advisory panel said this week that global warming already is blighting the U.S. with more intense coastal flooding, rainstorms and wildfires, but “weather extremes are good for the energy business," says money manager Skip Aylesworth.Climate change is proving to be a boon for energy investment; on the day the report was issued, the S&P Energy Index hit a record, and $322M flowed into ETFs that specialize in energy."Natural gas is a potential bridge to new technologies that are green or clean,” says State Street's David Mazza, which he says has sparked investor interest in companies such as Nabors Industries (NBR), EOG Resources (EOG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK).ETFs: XLE, ERX, VDE, OIH, ERY, FCG, DIG, DUG, GASL, IYE, GASX, PXJ, PXI, PSCE, FENY, RYE, FXN, DDG May 9, 2014, 11:58 AM | 11 Comments

Chesapeake rescue has CEO Lawler looking overseas for growth
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +0.6%) CEO Doug Lawler may take the company he inherited from founder Aubrey McClendon to the one place his deals-obsessed predecessor never wanted to go: overseas.According to a Bloomberg profile, Lawler’s immediate goals are to curb spending and sell enough gas fields and side businesses so CHK’s expenses aren’t outstripping its cash flow for the first time in more than a decade, but his long-term ambition is to amass foreign fields and transform CHK from a U.S. shale driller into a global oil explorer in the mold of his former employer Anadarko.The question for now is whether Lawler can ever get there: Despite the drastic cost-cutting, CHK's net debt has stubbornly hovered ~$12B, triple the size of Chevron’s, a company more than 10x larger by market value.

Chesapeake’s biggest investor grows more bullish on the stock
The outlook for Chesapeake Energy (CHK +1.7%) is on the upswing because CEO Doug Lawler has made substantial progress since taking the helm last June, top shareholder Southeastern Asset Management says in a letter today.Lawler’s “capital discipline and operational effectiveness will reward shareholders,” according to the owner of ~10% of CHK shares.Lawler has voiced plans to cut spending 20% this year, bringing it down to less than half of 2012 levels as CHK sells assets and spins off its oilfield services division.

Ohio geologists link earthquakes to fracking, state unveils tougher rules
Ohio geologists for the first time have linked earthquake activity in the Marcellus Shale to fracking, a new connection that could have implications for oil and gas drilling in the state and beyond.As a result, Ohio is setting new permitting conditions in quake-sensitive areas and has halted drilling indefinitely at the site of five quakes last month in the Youngstown area.Earthquakes recently rattled residents in Oklahoma, putting that state on track for record quake activity this year, which some seismologists say may be tied to oil and gas exploration.Among companies drilling in the Marcellus and Utica shales: RRC, CHK, COG, ACMP, APC, ATLS, CVX, CNX, DTE, EOG, EQT, XCO, XOM, MWE, NBL, RGP, REXX, RICE, RDS.A, RDS.B,SWN, STO, SXL, TLM, WMB, WPX.

Chesapeake plans record $3B bond offering
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +1.3%) says it is planning a record $3B bond offering in three parts to refinance debt, as the cost to protect its bonds against default approaches a six-year low.CHK intends to issue floating-rate notes due 2019 and fixed-rated securities maturing in 2022 and 2026; proceeds will be used to repay a term loan that matures in 2017, fund a tender offer for debt due 2015 and redeem 2018 securities.CHK's debt has gained 6.47% in the last year, better than the 5.6% gain among peers in Bloomberg's USD High Yield Corporate Bond Index.

Oklahoma seeing surge in earthquakes near fracking sites
Oklahoma is experiencing a noticeable increase in earthquakes near drilling sites, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey, suggesting a potential link between fracking and seismic activity.The state already has experienced as many earthquakes YTD than all of last year combined: 109 earthquakes with a magnitude 3 or higher through April 6, the same number of earthquakes as in all of 2013.The incidents pose a conundrum for regulators in a state that has fully embraced oil and gas drilling.Among drillers with a significant Oklahoma presence: CHK, CLR, APA, DVN, SD, EOG, MRO, OKE, OKS, GPOR, WPX, WMB, WPZ, LPI, CWEI, NFX, NGL, COG, WLL, NBL, MPO, PQ, XEC Apr. 10, 2014, 10:46 AM | 40 Comments
Oil firms pay $630M in Pennsylvania drilling fees, critics say it's not enough
Drilling fees on nearly 6,500 natural gas wells in the Marceluus Shale will bring more than $630M to Pennsylvania's coffers by the end of the year, three years after the state passed the fees into law, but critics say the oil and gas companies aren’t paying enough.Range Resources (RRC) paid the most with $27M in fees last year, followed by Chesapeake Energy (CHK) with $26.6M; among others, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) forked over $13.2M, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) paid $12.3M, and EOG Resources (EOG) coughed up $4.5M.Critics who want the companies to pay more point to a report from the state’s independent fiscal branch that found Pennsylvania’s drilling fees were lower than severance tax rates on gas production in Texas and other states, which do not have drilling fees.

Moody’s: Marcellus shale gas producers to benefit most
Marcellus shale gas producers will benefit more than producers elsewhere in the U.S. because of several favorable circumstances - including large producing wells in the northeast U.S. conveniently located near major markets - even if prices were to decline to 2012 levels, according to a Moody’s report.Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) - all of which entered the play early during a weak natural gas price environment - especially have benefited, Moody's says.An infrastructural overhaul is still needed as buyers move away from traditional production hubs such as the Haynesville and Barnett, the credit rating agency says; the transition already has caused a decline in credit quality for Exco Resources (XCO), Forest Oil (FST) and Quicksilver Resources (KWK).

Chesapeake’s faltering Oklahoma gas field threatens $880M in loans
Lower than expected production from Chesapeake Energy’s (CHK -1.1%) Sahara natural gas field in Oklahoma is threatening $880M in loans and notes from Barclays under a pair of agreements that repay the borrowings with future supplies of gas, crude oil and gas byproducts, Bloomberg reports.Output from 3,300 CHK-operated wells in the Sahara field was 12% below projections during six months ending in February, Moody’s says; as a result, the production coverage ratio on the Glenn Pool Oil & Gas Trust five-year loan and 10-year notes declined to 1.18 from 1.29.In December, Moody’s had downgraded ratings on $360M in CHK borrowings backed by Barnett Shale wells in Texas after production growth there slowed to 3.4% in 2013 after growing at double-digit rates in 11 of the prior 12 years.

Strong insider buying could foreshadow better days ahead for Chesapeake
Chesapeake Energy (CHK) stock has dropped ~6% over the last six months vs. the S&P 500's 10% rise, but Chairman Archie Dunham is still a buyer, adding another 54K shares last week totaling ~$1.4M.The former ConocoPhillips chairman has spent $17.4M buying CHK shares in the fewer than two years since he came out of retirement to head CHK's board.Dunham isn’t the only board member buying; CHK directors have spent $27.8M buying shares since June 2012, when the company stripped Aubrey McClendon of his chairmanship and installed Dunham and other new directors; those shares now are worth ~$33.3M.The latest buying suggests confidence in CHK's new leadership and strategy; under CEO Doug Lawler, who joined last June, the company cut capital spending in half in 2013 to $7.2B from $14.1B the previous year with plans to trim another 20% in 2014.

Chesapeake, Encana set to answer antitrust charges in Michigan
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -0.4%) and Encana (ECA -1.3%) appear before a Michigan judge today to answer allegations they criminally conspired to lower land leases in the state.Collaboration between the two companies may have caused lease prices to plummet from $1,510/acre at a May 2010 auction to less than $40/acre at an auction conducted five months later, according to the Michigan AG.ECA has expanded its presence in the region’s Collingwood shale formation, controlling ~429K acres by the end of 2012, while CHK withdrew from the area after investing $400M.

Chesapeake files for possible spinoff of oilfield services
Chesapeake Energy (CHK) +2.6% premarket on news that it has filed with the SEC for a possible spinoff of its oilfield services division.CHK says it intends for the spinoff to be tax-free to its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.The business, which would be called Seventy Seven Energy after the spinoff, operates the fifth-largest U.S. land-based rig fleet, with 77 walking, pad-capable units; it drills, provides oilfield tools and operates fracking services in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Marcellus and other U.S. shale plays.

WSJ: Chesapeake accused of underpaying gas royalties
WSJ examines Chesapeake Energy's (CHK -0.7%) deepening dispute with Pennsylvanians over royalty payments to those with CHK wells on their land.Pennsylvania requires oil and gas drillers pay royalties of at least 12.5%, but lets drillers deduct costs for transporting, processing and marketing - and CHK appears to take a much more aggressive approach to those deductions than other energy companies operating there, including Anadarko (APC) and Statoil (STO)."I'm paying them to take my gas," says one landowner who claims his royalties don't cover the added taxes for owning commercial property.The public outcry has grown so loud that Pennsylvania Gov. Corbett, who has received campaign contributions from the company, wrote an open letter last month asking the state attorney general to investigate. Mar. 12, 2014, 10:19 AM | 7 Comments

Chesapeake, Encana charged in Michigan over collusion
Michigan has indicted Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Encana (ECA) with conspiring to keep down oil and gas lease prices in the state.If found guilty, the companies could face penalties of up to $1M, while individuals could receive prison sentences as well as fines.The charges follow an investigation that was sparked by a Reuters article about how then Chesapeake CEO Aubrey McClendon and other senior executives at the company and at Encana discussed not "bidding each other up."The talks came after Michigan prices soared to as high as $3,000 per acre in mid-2010; they then fell sharply later that year.Encana and Chesapeake still face a separate, federal investigation.

Report: McClendon trying to force Chesapeake to drill wells it doesn't want
Nearly a year after Chesapeake Energy (CHK) ousted Aubrey McClendon after a governance scandal and a liquidity crisis, the former CEO retains financial ties to CHK and is using them to try to change company plans, according to a Reuters report.McClendon is attempting to force CHK to drill 12 multimillion dollar wells in Louisiana's Haynesville Shale even as CHK tries to rein in spending and cut debt to focus on other shales, according to a CHK lawyer.As a legacy of founding CHK, McClendon has personal stakes of 2.5% in nearly all of the tens of thousands of wells the company developed; he is also entitled to a slice of new wells, and he has asked Louisiana regulators to order CHK to follow his drilling plan.

EOG Resources moves higher as Q4 results reviewed favorably
While Chesapeake (CHK -7.1%) languishes after reporting its Q4 earnings, natural gas producer EOG Resources (EOG +1.8%) continues to rise after its Q4 results beat expectations.Howard Weil raises its EOG price target to $210 from $191 following strong earnings coupled with encouraging conference call commentary on EOG's domestic onshore portfolio; EOG has exhibited tremendous success in discovering new horizontal oil resource plays and capturing sizable acreage positions, and has improved well performance and reduced costs in other key areas outside of the Eagle Ford (Briefing.com).RBC Capital lifts its target to $206 from $182 as EOG increased its Eagle Ford net potential recoverable reserves by 45%; the firm thinks FY 2014 production growth guidance probably was conservative (Briefing.com).

Chesapeake -3.1% premarket as earnings sink on production decline
Chesapeake Energy (CHK) -3.1% premarket after swinging to an unadjusted Q4 loss, hurt by charges related to its efforts to reduce debt and simplify its balance sheet, and adjusted earnings and revenues fall short of expectations.Average daily oil production rose 15% Y/Y but fell 7% Q/Q, average daily natural gas liquids production gained 26% Y/Y and 9% Q/Q, and natural gas production slipped 3% Y/Y and 1% Q/Q; planned reductions were responsible for most of the decrease, but cold weather also had an impact.So far in 2014, CHK has received $209M net proceeds from asset sales and expects to receive $150M-plus related to asset sales in 2012-13; the anticipated sale of its oilfield services business is seen generating another $650M.Proved reserves were 2.7B boe at year-end 2013, a 2% increase from year-end 2012.

Jefferies values Chesapeake's oilfield services business at $2.5B
Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) oilfield services business could be worth $2.5B as the company seeks to either sell or spin off the business, according to a Jefferies analysis.CHK could use a sale of the business to fund most of the E&P's 2014 cash flow deficit, minimizing the need for additional asset sales, particularly among its portfolio of producing oil and natural gas fields, Jefferies says.The firm also forecasts CHK will outspend its cash flows by $800M-$1B in 2014, meaning that any asset monetization could plug a shortfall for the year.

Chesapeake investing in Haynesville gas play as prices rise
Rising natural gas prices could help Chesapeake Energy (CHK) profit off a plan to revive the maligned Haynesville shale play, where it gambled billions of dollars six years ago, and the 7-9 rigs CHK expects to deploy to the reservoir this year could boost daily rates for U.S. land drilling companies, analysts say.CHK's plan would increase the number of Haynesville rigs 25% to ~50 by the end of this year, according to an analysis by Raymond James - not like the old days, but renewed gas drilling could drive up margins for U.S. rig contractors by spreading out demand to other regions in the country.

Chesapeake under fire from Pennsylvania governor over Marcellus royalties
The Pennsylvania governor says he is launching an investigation of Chesapeake Energy's  (CHK) Marcellus shale royalty payment practices, adding to scrutiny of the company for allegedly defrauding landowners out of payments owed to them from gas production in the state.State law in Pennsylvania requires oil and gas producers to pay a minimum of 12.5% in royalties to owners of land where drilling takes place; companies are allowed to charge "post-production costs" for the transportation or processing of gas, but CHK invokes that right more than any other company, which Corbett says has led to the "erosion of trust and goodwill of the natural gas industry."

Severe winter weather hitting Chesapeake's natural gas output
Freezing weather across the U.S. this winter have pushed demand for natural gas to all-time highs, but at the same time a number of companies are saying the foul weather is hurting production.The latest is Chesapeake Energy (CHK), whose oil and gas output in December was well below its expectations due to "weather challenges" that continued into January and February, CEO Doug Lawler told analysts on today's earnings call.Anadarko (APC) said yesterday during its call that its operations in Colorado were finally returning to normal.Estimated U.S. natural gas output is running ~800M cf/day lower than the 30-day moving average and is off 1.5B cf/day from the start of this year when temperatures were more moderate.

Natural gas tops $5 for first time since 2010, demand should remain high
As the U.S. freezes and stocks plunge, benchmark U.S. natural gas futures topped $5/mmBtu for the first time since Aug. 2010 on expectations that continued cold weather would keep demand high for the heating fuel.Natl gas has moved well into overbought territory during the last few days as consumers have pumped up their thermostats, and the spike may last a while longer given that the cold snap is set to continue all of next week.Despite the run-up in prices for Jan. and Feb., longer-dated prices for the spring and summer remain below $4.50/mmBtu, providing little incentive for the likes of Chesapeake (CHK -0.1%), Devon (DVN -0.8%) and EOG (EOG -2%) to switch from oil to gas drilling.The shift to backwardation is a big boost to United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG +8.2%) and even bigger to the leveraged VelocityShares 3X Long Natural Gas ETN (UGAZ +24.4%).Other ETFs: GAZ, BOIL, DGAZ, UNL, KOLD, NAGS, DCNG.

Oil futures hint at problems for E&Ps, but analyst likes EOG and Noble Energy
Exploration and production companies tend to track crude oil prices, J.P. Morgan's Joseph Allman says, so look no further than the current state of the oil futures market for a reason to be bearish on the sector.WTI oil futures, which decline every quarter in 2014 and beyond, suggest an off year for the E&P group, Allman writes, noting that the set-up could be similar to 2012, when WTI was down 7% for the year and the S&P was up 13%.That doesn’t mean that some oil stocks can’t outperform: Allman likes EOG Resources (EOG) and Noble Energy (NBL) among large caps for their “resource expansion and improved operations.”His least favorite stocks in the sector include Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Devon Energy (DVN) and Chesapeake (CHK).

Chesapeake asset sales proving expensive
Chesapeake Energy (CHK) is paying tens of millions of dollars in services it's not using and on other seemingly wasteful costs as a result of asset sales it made to plug a $25B hole in its finances.For example, as part of a number of deals to sell its pipeline business for over $4B last year, Chesapeake agreed to transport a certain amount of natural gas on lines that Access Midstream Partners (ACMP) now owns. The problem is that because Chesapeake is cutting back on drilling for new wells, the company isn't using the capacity it has reserved. It could now have to pay $400M to Access over the next five years to cover the shortfall. Dec. 30, 2013, 3:53 AM | 7 Comments

Chesapeake shares turn lower on weaker oil outlook
The initially favorable reaction to Chesapeake Energy's (CHK -6.7%) Q3 earnings announcement is turning into a rout, as shares turn sharply negative on a forecast of lower oil production this quarter.Higher-than-expected oil production in Q3 helped CHK beat expectations, but weather disruptions and asset sales will cut Q4 output by ~9K bbl/day, the company said on its earnings call.This quarter, CHK plans to operate an average of 59 rigs and to complete ~14 fewer wells Q/Q, prompting CHK to lower its 2013 full-year outlook for drilling and well completion costs to $5.5B-$5.8B from $5.7B-$6B.

Chesapeake cut to Hold at Stifel on fair valuation
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -0.9%) is downgraded to Hold from Buy at Stifel Nicolaus on fair valuation, expectations for no production growth heading into 2014, and a view that ongoing efficiency improvements and additional potential non-core asset sales will not add enough meaningful upside potential to shares.Stifel thinks investors will begin to shift their investment focus from P/NAV discounts to EBITDA multiples and the growth outlook for CHK; as the shift happens, CHK looks fairly valued on an absolute basis and will underperform relative to its peers, the firm believes.

EPA's new carbon rules hurt coal, could accelerate shift to natural gas
Both critics and supporters of the new EPA draft regulations on CO2 emissions agree on one thing: This will be the final blow to many proposed coal plants.The truth is, U.S. coal generation already was in decline not because of climate regulations, but because of good ol' free-market capitalism; the boom in natural gas production has dramatically increased supplies, sent prices plummeting and prompted a shift away from coal.Among potential long-term winners: U.S. nat gas drillers such as CHK and XOM, drilling services firms such as HAL and BHI, pipeline companies such as SE and KMI, makers of gas-fired turbines such as GE and SI, power generators such as NRG and CPN if electricity prices rise.Likely losers: Coal appears headed for a decline, and companies with large Appalachian operations such as JRCC and ANR could suffer most as more coal comes from cheaper-to-access deposits in the Illinois Basin and Wyoming; big industrial companies, which have used low U.S. power prices as a competitive advantage, are concerned.ETFs: KOL, IDU, PUI, XLU, VPU, RYU, FXU, PSCU, UPW, SDP, UTLT.

TD Ameritrade index shows clients buying August's dip
The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index increased 5.95% to 5.16 in August as markets stumbled, meaning clients continued their pattern of selling the rips and buying the dips - the index previously fell in July as stocks rallied.There was no contrarian action in Tesla (TSLA), where clients continued to buy as it gained for the month. Dip-buying was notable, however, in a number of basic material companies, including BP, Kinder Morgan (KMP), and Potash (POT).Clients were net sellers in financial names like Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), and they faded rallies in Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB).

Chesapeake releases 13K acres of NY drilling leases
Chesapeake Energy (CHK +1.2%) agrees to release more than 13K acres of land leased for oil and gas drilling in New York state, ending a two-year legal battle with more than 200 landowners; reports of CHK's decision filtered out last week.Some landowners, who signed their leases before the U.S. drilling boom boosted land prices in gas-rich areas, want a release from the leases to seek better deals; others are opposed to any drilling on their land altogether.The 13K acres is a small part of the 2.5M acres CHK holds in natural gas shale plays across the U.S., but it's a meaningful sum for New York, where CHK is one of the biggest leaseholders.

Chesapeake New York gas lease agreement expected next week
Chesapeake Energy (CHK) will finalize an agreement next week to drop ~12K acres of land leased for energy drilling in New York state, Reuters reports, ending a two-year legal battle with landowners who wanted to cancel expired leases or renegotiate for better terms.CHK's decision to drop the leases is a sign of the growing frustration of energy firms over operating in New York, where a moratorium on fracking is in its sixth year, and an indication that CHK is pulling back on spending after years of aggressive acreage buying.

Reuters: Chesapeake pumping up royalty deductions to cut costs
As the natural gas industry struggles with depressed prices, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) is shifting a much larger share of transportation and marketing costs to the owners of land it leases in Pennsylvania, according to a Reuters analysis.The largest natural gas operator in Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale formation, CHK this year is taking much heavier deductions from royalty checks it sends landowners, in many cases cutting compensation by more than half.Such deductions are made in other states, but an ambiguous Pennsylvania law has allowed CHK and others to push the practice further there, analysts and locals say.

U.S. oil companies set to spend $160B this year to boost production
Wall Street estimates the big E&P companies and integrated oils will spend nearly $160B this year to ramp up production, with little risk of a year-end onshore slowdown as was seen in 2012.Initial indicators also suggest the companies are more willing than expected to invest more capex dollars into U.S. onshore drilling to benefit from efficiency-driven cost improvements.24/7's Lee Jackson lists some of the companies spending the most money to find oil, led by Apache (APA), Anadarko (APC) and Chesapeake (CHK), each expected to spend at least $5.5B this year.

Barron's: Has Chesapeake peaked?
Chesapeake Energy (CHK -0.8%) loses its initial pop caused by Friday's disclosure of Carl Icahn's increased near-10% stake, prompting Barron's to ask if Icahn has arrived a bit too late to the party after shares have surged nearly 30% YTD.Asset sales are driving CHK's story, but uncertainty remains about future production growth, and thus its cash flow; while CHK raised its 2013 crude production estimate, Macquarie points out management indicated in its Q2 conference call that two-thirds of the guidance revision was driven by timing of asset sales while performance improvements only drove one-third.

Chesapeake Energy gives up drilling leases in New York
Chesapeake Energy (CHK) has withdrawn from a two-year legal battle to extend leases to drill for natural gas on thousands of acres of land in New York State.Chesapeake, which obtained the licenses in 2000 - prior to the shale revolution - wanted to retain the leases on the original terms, arguing that NY's five-year moratorium on fracking allowed it to do so.Landowners argued otherwise and wanted to negotiate new terms. They're now free to do so and possibly at higher rates.Chesapeake's move possibly reflects frustration at NY's stance and/or its strategy to limit spending as it looks to cut debt.

Oil production averaged 1,742 bbl/day, while gas totaled 35M cf/day. Chesapeake (CHK) was by far the largest producer, with total 2012 output of 10B cf of gas, followed by Hess (HES) and Gulfport (GPOR); Devon Energy (DVN) produced no gas from its five wells.

The rush to buy acreage in Ohio's Utica shale has reversed, as some of the biggest stakeholders in untapped deposits there - including CHK, DVN, PDCE and EVEP - have put up all or part of their acreage for sale.

"It's a pretty good bet" he's short any leveraged players that were buying gas properties 5 years ago and looking to sell now.

Chesapeake (CHK) has earned $5.5B pretax since its founding 23 years ago, and has paid income taxes on less than 1% of it. CHK and other U.S. oil and gas producers can thank a century-old rule that allows them to postpone income taxes in recognition of the risk of drilling wells that may turn out to be dry - a break that may be outdated, as oil or gas was struck in 99.6% of wells last year.

Encana (ECA) has been expanding in the burgeoning Collingwood oil shale exploration region in Michigan that Chesapeake (CHK) had recently abandoned and has emerged in a possible bid-rigging controversy, Bloomberg reports.

Investors need to ask E&P companies: What's in your barrel?

As Chesapeake (CHK) confirms its $3B bridge loan has turned into $4B, Sanford Bernstein notes if CHK’s debt pile amounts to more than 4X its trailing four quarters of EBITDA, it would trigger a cascading bond default.

Carl Icahn will want something big in return for his anticipated stake in Chesapeake (CHK +7.5%), and there's even less standing in his way than in his victory in taking control of CVR Energy, where he replaced seven of the nine members of CVR’s board.

The latest sign Chesapeake (CHK) could be in a death spiral: It's damned if it does (sell the assets it needs to sell) and damned if it doesn't (earlier). When natural gas prices were high, CHK was able to aggressively raise money from asset sales to keep drilling in new areas and bring down debt. But with prices near decade-lows, a change in strategy may be necessary, Phil Weiss says.

A man of many hats... While building Chesapeake (CHK), Aubrey McClendon also has helped run a hedge fund and two VC firms; battled a township in Michigan over zoning for a real estate development; acquired ownership stakes in an NBA team, a TV station, several restaurants, a cattle ranch and a cancer treatment center; and opened a store on Route 66 that sells 500 varieties of soda.

The big moves in Green Mountain (GMCR -48%) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK +1.91%) recently have value investors chomping at the bit to scoop up shares at deep discounts.

Here's Chesapeake's (CHK -13.5%) conundrum: CHK has been touting its shift from natural gas to liquids as a way to overcome low natural gas prices, but its production of liquids is unimpressive so far. And weak nat gas prices make it more difficult to find the funds needed to drill the wells for producing the liquids. For today at least, this explains more of CHK's price swoon than McClendon's antics.

Natural gas futures drop below $2 for the first time since Jan. 2002, as weak demand and robust production have sent prices sliding 33% YTD. While the number of working U.S. gas rigs has fallen 27% Y/Y, gas output remains high because most wells produce a mix of oil and gas regardless of classification; high oil prices thus often effectively subsidize the cost of continued gas production.

"The worst part has got to be over," says Wilbur Ross of natural gas, conceding his purchase of Exco (XCO) was a bit early.

A deceleration in the growth of natural gas supply over coming years may be in the cards, posits Robert Sinn, noting the price has now fallen below the all-in production cost for Ultra Petroleum (UPL), one of the industry's lowest-cost operators.
