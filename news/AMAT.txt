Applied Materials +1.5%; outperformance reiterated, target increased to $40 at Cowen and Company
Analyst Timothy Arcuri: "See strong results w/guide that seems more likely ~$0.70 as a bogey (Street $0.63). Given spending mix in '17, AMAT seems unlikely to lose share and should gain; ergo, if WFE=$36B or better (AMAT 22.9% WFE share in '16), SSG should do ~$8.5B and Street still looks too low for C2017. Increasing estimates + target to $40 with C2018 EPS now $3.20 which ought to ultimately support $40." Target from $33 prior.Q1 2017 results are scheduled for release Wednesday, February 15.Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) $35.85 premarket.

Google, Applied Materials, Japan among early picks at Barron's Roundtable
The first line goes to Jeff Gundlach, who at last year's Barron's Roundtable predicted the election of Donald Trump. This year: "The history books will say that interest rates bottomed in July 2012, and double-bottomed in July 2016. At some point, the backup in rates will create competition for stocks."He notes commodity prices look to have bottomed and the Atlanta Fed's wage-growth tracker is now up 4% Y/Y. The valuation argument for equities becomes "problematic" once the 10-year yield hits 3%, which could happen this year.Making his last appearance at the confab, Felix Zulauf thinks stocks will struggle and end the year in negative territory, but that's mostly an H2 issue. For now, he wants to stick with what's doing well, and recommends the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEARCA:VTV), the Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), and the Financial Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF).He's also bullish on Japan, where a dovish BOJ and government has shown no sign of caution. Expecting a tumbling currency to occur alongside rising stocks, he's a fan of WisdomTree's Japan Hedged Equity Fund (NYSEARCA:DXJ).Sooner or later, cash is going to be distributed, says Epoch Investment Partners' Bill Priest, giving a big part of the reason he's recommending Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). The free-cash-flow yield is about 7%.Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is in the "sweet spot" of the technology revolution, says Priest. He thinks it will generate $3 per share in cash flow in fiscal 2019.Other picks: Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) and Hexcel (NYSE:HXL).

Western Digital, Intel, Applied Materials, Lam Research, ASML observed positively on Micron reporting
Wells Fargo's Maynard Um suggests benefit to Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) on Micron's remarks of strengthening NAND demand and restricted supply (attributes 3D NAND transition), as well as PC market strength that came in better than anticipated, potentially indicating favorably for HDDs.RBC Capital Markets' Amit Daryanani, on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), similarly highlights PC market observations out of Micron prospectively signaling strong demand in the category. For Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), spotlights Micron's target of $4.8B-$5.2B in capital investments for the coming year, considering Applied Materials and Lam Research the most likely beneficiaries of increased 3D NAND spending, with ASML support to come primarily within greenfield fabrications, though less so in planar to 3D conversion.

Applied Materials +1.3% as Nomura hikes target after meeting
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is up 1.3% after Nomura raised its price target following an investor meeting with the company's CFO and display chief.The firm's Romit Shah maintained a Buy rating and raised his price target on shares to $28 from $25, implying 15% upside.Nomura met with CFO Bob Halliday and displays exec Briah Shih, and said Halliday struck a "very positive tone, alluding that Applied is firing on all cylinders." The company's long-term EPS target of $2 for 2018 looked conservative, Halliday suggested.Etch -- the fastest growing segment in the company's Silicon Systems Group -- is driving growth in 3D NAND, and Foundry spending is set for a recovery later this year, Shah says.Shah ranks No. 336 out of 3,980 analysts at TipRanks.

Nikkei: Samsung spending $6.8B to boost OLED capacity ahead of 2017 iPhone launches
Japan's Nikkei reports Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNNF) plans to spend KRW8T ($6.82B) in 2016 to increase its smartphone OLED panel capacity by over 50%, or more than 200M/year. Samsung is believed to already have the capacity to produce 300M+ smartphone OLED panels per year.The report follows ones indicating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to launch iPhones featuring OLEDs in 2017, with some of the reports stating Samsung and LG Display (LPL -0.3%) will be among the suppliers. A Korean news service reported in April Samsung will supply 100M 5.5" OLEDs annually to Apple starting next year. The Nikkei suggests Apple will partly rely on OLEDs for its 2017 iPhone lineup.OLED materials/IP provider Universal Display (OLED +0.3%) has moved slightly higher following the report. Industrial laser maker Coherent (COHR -0.4%) also stands to benefit from major OLED investments, as does chip equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT -1%). Jun. 17, 2016, 2:09 PM | 22 Comments

Chip equipment firms, OLED names outperform after Applied Materials' earnings

The Nasdaq is up 1.2%.Applied's order growth was fueled in large part by display equipment orders totaling $700M, up sharply from $183M in the prior quarter and $120M a year ago. On its earnings call, AMAT said display order strength is likely to continue "over the rest of 2016," and is being driven by mobile-related OLED investments - many reports have indicated Apple plans to bring iPhones sporting OLEDs to market next year.OLED materials/IP provider Universal Display (OLED +5.2%) is rallying. As are display panel makers LG Display (LPL +6.5%) and AU Optronics (AUO +3.2%), each of which have been stepping up their OLED investments, and industrial laser maker Coherent (COHR +2.5%), which has recently seen an OLED-related order surge.Also: Applied's NAND flash-related orders more than doubled Y/Y to nearly $1B thanks to its customers' 3D NAND investments. That more than offset softer DRAM and foundry-related chip equipment demand. On the call, Applied suggested NAND orders will slow a bit in the second half of FY16, but remain strong overall. Foundry demand is expected to grow somewhat this year, with Applied gaining share. Industry wafer fab equipment demand is expected to be flat to slightly up.B. Riley has upgraded Applied to Buy, and several firms have hiked their targets. Cowen's Tim Arcuri thinks $3 in annual EPS is now possible. Credit Suisse's Farhan Ahmad: "AMAT is clearly outgrowing peers this year, driven by favourable mix shift within WFE (NAND/Foundry increasing, DRAM declining) and strong growth in Display (China/OLED investments)."

Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is now up 8.3% after hours to $21.57 after beating FQ2 estimates, issuing FQ3 guidance that was well above consensus, and reporting orders rose 37% Y/Y to $3.45B. "In our second quarter we booked our highest orders in 15 years and we expect to deliver record earnings in fiscal 2016," says CEO Gary Dickerson.The order growth was fueled in part by $700M worth of display equipment orders, up from just $183M in FQ1 and $120M a year ago. Both OLED manufacturers and Chinese LCD manufacturers have been ramping their investments.Also helping: Silicon Systems (chip equipment) orders rose 15% Y/Y to $1.97B. Strong flash memory-related orders (49% of Silicon Systems orders vs. 21% a year ago thanks to 3D NAND flash investments) offset weaker DRAM (17% vs. 31%) and foundry (23% vs. 36%) orders. Logic/other orders were at 11% vs. 12% a year ago.

Global Services orders rose 6% Y/Y to $677, and Energy and Environmental Solutions Orders (led by solar) more than doubled to $108M.Boosting EPS: $900M was spent on buybacks. Adjusted gross margin fell 50 bps Y/Y to 42.7%, and adjusted op. margin fell 30 bps to 19.2%.

Chip equipment stocks gain following Applied Materials' earnings/guidance (updated)
Lam Research (LRCX +4%), KLA-Tencor (KLAC +2.2%), ASML (ASML +2.6%), Axcelis (ACLS +3.9%), Rudolph Technology (RTEC +2.3%) and Xcerra (XCRA +4.9%) have caught sympathy bids after chip equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT +9.4%) slightly beat FQ1 estimates and (more importantly) issued strong FQ2 guidance. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Applied's numbers come after Lam and ASML forecast demand would pick up in calendar Q2 following a soft Q1. On its earnings call (transcript), Applied forecast the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market would be roughly flat in 2016 - Gartner forecast a 2.5% drop in January, followed by 8.1% growth in 2017 and 9.1% growth in 2018.2016 outlook: NAND flash equipment spend is expected to be up ~25% Y/Y in 2016 thanks to 3D NAND investments; DRAM spend is expected to drop ~20%, and logic spend be roughly flat. CFO Robert Halliday: "We do believe that the first half is a little bit more weighted to NAND, whereas the second half is more weighted to stronger performance in foundry, logic and DRAM. So we do see a stronger second half." Applied expects to gain WFE share in 2016, aided by strong 3D NAND and 10nm process positions.Orders: Not surprisingly (given soft near-term demand), Applied's chip equipment orders fell in FQ1, dropping 11% Y/Y to $1.28B. However, services orders rose 12% to $773M, and display orders (boosted by OLED equipment demand) rose 71% to $183M. Energy/environmental (solar) orders fell 12% to $44M. (earnings release)Needham's Edwin Mok has upgraded Applied to Buy, with a $22 target. "We believe AMAT's strategy and efforts to drive growth in the Silicon, Display and [global services] businesses are finally starting to yield results, even with limited industry growth ahead. With improving gross margins and good cost control ahead, we now expect the model to deliver strong, double-digit-% earnings growth in 2-3 years, even though it is trading largely in line with other large-cap Semi names."Update: In other news, Lam Research and KLA-Tencor shareholders have each approved the companies' planned merger. The deal is still expected to close in mid-2016. Feb. 19, 2016, 12:25 PM | 1 Comment

Goldman adds Applied Materials to Conviction Buy list, sees demand improving
Believing estimates and investor sentiment are set to improve, Goldman's Toshiya Hari has added Applied Materials (AMAT +1%) to his firm's Conviction Buy list, and set a $22 target.Hari: "The blocking of its merger with Tokyo Electron by the Department of Justice and cuts to capex in the logic/foundry segment made 2015 a challenging year for AMAT ... Looking ahead, we believe 1) signs of a recovery in the order environment (i.e., primarily at the foundries), 2) further confirmation of market share gains and 3) an inflection in gross margins in 2H16, should all contribute towards higher estimates and a re-rating of the stock."CLSA upgraded Applied last month. Given the company's reporting history, FQ1 results will likely arrive later in February. Feb. 3, 2016, 9:55 AM
Chip equipment makers underperform after Intel cuts capex budget; analysts defend
Up strongly yesterday as markets rallied and TSMC set a 2016 capex budget of $9B-$10B (up from 2015 capex of $8.12B), a slew of chip equipment makers are seeing big losses amid a 3.3% Nasdaq drop after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) used its Q4 report to disclose its 2016 capex budget has been cut by $500M to $9.5B (+/- $500M). That's still up by $2.2B at the midpoint from 2015's $7.3B, but lower than the $10.1B-$11B spent annually from 2011-2014.On Intel's earnings call (transcript), CEO Brian Krzanich indicated the budget cut is related to logic (i.e. CPU) capex, and insisted no specific major factor was responsible. "As we went from the investor meeting into the actual firm forecast for 2016, the team has just sharpened down all the numbers and went through it in more detail."Major decliners: Applied Materials (AMAT -4.3%), Lam Research (LRCX -6.5%), KLA-Tencor (KLAC -3.8%), ASML (ASML -6.3%), MKS Instruments (MKSI -3.9%), Ultratech (UTEK -4.9%), Teradyne (TER -3.1%), Advantest (ATE -4.6%), and Ultra Clean (UCTT -5.2%).Stifel's Patrick Ho argues the selloff is a buying opportunity. "[W]e have already seen positive preannouncements with two of our names (Ultra Clean, Axcelis) and we expect more upside surprise than those on the downside ... We believe 3D NAND momentum continues to build while there has been some initial buying for 10nm logic (Intel) and foundry (TSMC). We maintain our industry thesis that 3D NAND spending will be the largest incremental driver for spending in 2016, with upside potential from the foundries in 2H16 related to 10nm investments." He likes Applied, Lam, Teradyne, and MKS.Credit Suisse's Farhan Ahmad notes Applied, ASML, and Lam have relatively low Intel exposure, and that a Korea Times report indicates DRAM/NAND flash maker SK Hynix's capex might increase in 2016. On the other hand, he's worried current expectations for EUV system shipments (important for ASML) are too optimistic.Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), another top-3 chip equipment buyer, reports after the Jan. 21 close. Citi's Atif Malik sees Samsung cutting capex due to lower DRAM-related spending. "We think Samsung moderating memory spend, particularly DRAM, would improve memory supply-demand balance and sustainability of memory equipment spend in C16." Jan. 15, 2016, 2:26 PM
Chip equipment makers rally after TSMC guides for 2016 capex increase (updated)
In its Q4 report, TSMC (a top-3 chip equipment buyer, along with Intel and Samsung) set a 2016 capex budget of $9B-$10B, a healthy increase over reported 2015 capex of $8.12B. The spending will help finance TSMC's 16nm manufacturing process ramp and the start of production (towards the end of 2016) for its 10nm process.A slew of chip equipment makers are outperforming amid a 1.8% Nasdaq gain. The list includes Applied Materials (AMAT +4.3%), ASML (ASML +3%), Teradyne (TER +2.4%), Axcelis (ACLS +6.6%), Xcerra (XCRA +5.5%), Ultratech (UTEK +4%), Advantest (ATE +2.2%), and merger partners Lam Research (LRCX +4.1%) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC +2.9%).Rudolph Technologies (RTEC +11.5%) is benefiting from an upgrade to Buy from Sifel's Patrick Ho. He cites strong advanced chip packaging exposure, a new CEO, an improved ability to land repeat orders, and a belief Rudolph is an attractive M&A target.2016 industry expectations have been low - Gartner recently forecast wafer fab equipment spend would drop 2.5% this year to $31.1B due to weak DRAM capex, after staying roughly flat in 2015 amid Intel/TSMC capex budget cuts. 8.1% and 9.1% growth is respectively forecast for 2017 and 2018.Intel reports after the bell. In November, the CPU giant set a 2016 capex budget of $10B (+/- $500M), up from 2015's depressed $7.3B (+/- $500M).Update (4:35PM ET): Intel has used its Q4 report to cut its 2016 capex budget by $500M to $9.5B (+/- $500M). Some chip equipment markers are down fractionally after hours. Jan. 14, 2016, 1:48 PM | 1 Comment
Einhorn cuts MU and AMAT stakes, exits LRCX, enters GRMN
David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital lowered its Micron (MU +1.2%) stake by 67% in Q3 to 12.4M shares, per Greenlight's Q3 13F.Einhorn, whose fund was down 16% YTD through October due to losses taken in SunEdison, Micron, and Consol Energy, had upped his Micron stake to 37.5M shares in Q2, and defended the DRAM/NAND giant his Q2 letter following a major selloff. Micron is currently down 57% YTD.Einhorn also liquidated a 1.6M-share position in chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX), which in early Q4 announced it's acquiring KLA-Tencor.His position in Lam rival Applied Materials (AMAT +0.1%) was lowered to 5M shares from 8.2M. Applied jumped last week after providing better-than-feared FQ4 results, FQ1 guidance, and order data, and forecasting on its earnings call it expects the wafer fab equipment market to be flat or up, better than expectations for a moderate decline.A 600K-share position was taken in Garmin (GRMN -0.2%). The navigation hardware maker was hammered in October following a Q3 warning, but has since largely recovered its losses. Nov. 17, 2015, 10:37 AM | 31 Comments
Applied Materials +3.9% after better-than-feared results, guidance, orders
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) expects FQ1 revenue to be down 2%-9% Q/Q. That implies a range of $2.16B-$2.32B vs. a $2.26B consensus. Likewise, EPS guidance of $0.23-$0.27 is in-line with a $0.24 consensus. Expectations were low in the wake of Intel and TSMC's multiple capex budget cuts and sizable DRAM/NAND flash price declines.Orders: FQ4 orders totaled $2.42B, -16% Q/Q but +7% Y/Y (FQ3's annual growth was 17%). Foundry orders (hurt by TSMC) were 35% of total chip equipment orders vs. 50% a year ago, DRAM was 21% vs. 20%, and logic/other (hurt by Intel) 13% vs. 18%. Flash (boosted by 3D NAND investments) was a strong point, growing to 31% from 12%.

Services orders rose 2% Y/Y to $761M. Display equipment orders rose 50% to $195M, and energy/environmental orders (solar) fell 45% to just $24M.Financials: EPS was boosted by $700M worth of buybacks at an average price of $15.78. Gross margin (non-GAAP) fell 170 bps Q/Q and 200 bps Y/Y to 42.2%. Operating expenses fell 6% to $544M. Applied ended FQ4 with $5.9B in cash/investments, and $4.5B in debt.Shares have risen to $17.18 after hours.FQ4 results, PR Nov. 12, 2015, 5:28 PM

Chip equipment stocks continue rally following Lam/KLA deal
Up yesterday in response to Intel's flash manufacturing plans, chip equipment makers are higher today after Lam Research (LRCX +5.6%) announced it's buying KLA-Tencor (KLAC +22.5%) for $10.6B, with the goal of creating an industry giant on par with Applied Materials (AMAT +1%).In addition to Lam, KLA, and Applied, gainers include ASML (ASML +2.3%), Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC +2.9%), Teradyne (TER +4.6%), Mattson (MTSN +2.6%), and Xcerra (XCRA +2.3%). Ahead of the deal announcement, Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF) rose 4% in Tokyo, aided by the Intel news and a rally in Japanese equities.Lam/KLA assert the deal combines "Lam's best-in-class capabilities in deposition, etch, and clean [equipment] with KLA-Tencor's leadership in inspection and metrology." Gartner estimates Lam and KLA respectively had 9.4% and 6.4% of the 2013 chip equipment market. Applied (competes with both KLA and Lam) had 16.2%, ASML (dominant in lithography) 15.7%, and Tokyo 9.1%.Lam is paying the equivalent of $32/share in cash and 0.5 shares (current value of $37) for each KLA share. It plans to finance the deal with $1.9B in cash on hand from both companies, and $3.9B in debt. KLA shareholders can elect to be paid solely in cash, solely in stock, or through a mixture of cash and stock.The deal is expected to close in mid-2016. Lam CEO Martin Anstice will run the combined firm. Oct. 21, 2015, 11:33 AM | 2 Comments
Chip equipment stocks gain after Intel unveils flash investment plans
Applied Materials (AMAT +2.3%) and Lam Research (LRCX +3.6%) have rallied after Intel announced plans to make up to $5.5B worth of flash memory manufacturing investments ($3.5B committed) in the coming years at its Dailan, China fab. 3D NAND manufacturing is expected to start in Dailan in 2H16.KLA-Tencor (KLAC +1.3%) and Axcelis (ACLS +1.8%), which also have strong memory exposure, are up moderately. The Nasdaq is down 0.5%.The group caught a bid last week after Intel cut its capex budget by $400M to $7.3B (+/- $500M), but added capex is expected to rise in 2016. Gartner has forecast moderate 2015 and 2016 declines in industry wafer fab equipment spend, followed by 8%+ growth in 2017 and 2018. Oct. 20, 2015, 3:58 PM
Applied Materials forms $108M Singapore R&D JV
Applied Materials (AMAT -0.1%) is forming a S$150M ($108M) JV with Singaporean research agency A*STAR to develop technology for wafer fab equipment to be used in future logic and memory chip manufacturing.Applied and A*STAR will build a lab containing a 400 sq. meter cleanroom, and which will be staffed by 60 researchers/scientists. The plan is for products developed by the JV to be manufactured by Applied's Singapore subsidiary.R&D accounted for 60% of Applied's GAAP operating expenses ($372M out of $622M) in the July quarter.

RBC turns bearish on AMAT and LRCX, cites memory capex fears
Believing chip industry capex will drop 13% in 2016 to $46B due to weak memory spend, RBC's Mahesh Sanganeria downgraded Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) to Underperform today, while respectively cutting his targets to $12 and $52.Sanganeria expects DRAM capex to drop 38% next year, and NAND flash capex 17%. Foundry capex is expected to be "flattish," and spending by IDMs (pressured this year by Intel's capex budget cuts) up 3%. "DRAM spending is positioned to decline in 2016 after two years of high level spending on new capacity and 20nm conversion. 3D NAND in CY16 appears to be limited after Samsung filled up Xi’an fab with 90k capacity as Micron and Toshiba need to expand current fabs for 3D conversion ... IDM/foundry spending will likely remain muted until 10nm ramp."He thinks Applied's 2016 outlook is too optimistic. "During JulQ earnings call, management expected DRAM spending to be down 10% and NAND to remain at a high level driven by continued 3D NAND investment in CY16. Additionally, the company expects big 10nm foundry spending."Regarding Lam, he observes DRAM/NAND now account for ~60% of total shipments. and thinks calendar Q4 shipments could miss estimates. DRAM and NAND prices have come under pressure in 2015, fueling speculation memory makers (Samsung in particular) could pare their investments.In spite of the downgrade, AMAT rose 1.1% in regular trading, aided by a 1.6% Nasdaq gain. Lam fell 0.4%. Both companies have had some bad news priced in over the last several months. Oct. 5, 2015, 7:02 PM | 3 Comments

Time Warner Cable among favored adds in funds' 13F filings
With a rack of 13F filings on the weekend disclosing Q2 holdings, it turns out that Time Warner Cable (TWC +2.1%) was among the top adds by hedge funds and influential investors.The company -- in the long process of being acquired by Charter Communications (CHTR +3.6%) -- got new stakes from 7.7% of filers, according to WhaleWisdom.com, which tracks 196 funds. Among those, Soros Fund Management took a 1.45M-share position.Only Perrigo (PRGO +0.6%) was added by more filers, at 10.2%. Investors filing that they had opened new buys of TWC came to 16.7M shares added in aggregate.On the other hand: TWC was also eliminated by the highest percentage of filers -- 6.6%, getting rid of 8.89M shares. On a net basis, acquisitions of shares still outnumbered dispositions. The second-biggest stock eliminated was Applied Materials (AMAT +2.3%), cut by 6.1% of filers who shed 28.36M shares in aggregate.Previously: Buffett 13-F and media: Bought Charter, cut stake in Viacom (Aug. 14 2015)More 13F coverage Aug. 17, 2015, 3:34 PM
AMAT now down 3.7% post-earnings; ASML down 2.7%
After barely budging at first in response to its FQ3 report - it featured a slight revenue miss, in-line EPS, light FQ4 guidance, and healthy order data - Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) has sold off to new 52-week lows today. Lithography equipment giant ASML is also off.Possibly weighing: On its earnings call (transcript), AMAT forecast 2015 wafer fab equipment (WFE) sales would be flat Y/Y (below a prior forecast for 3% growth), with potential downside risk. Lower-than-expected foundry capex is ,ostly blamed; memory capex remains strong, and (in spite of Intel's recent $1B capex budget cut) Applied's logic outlook is unchanged.Several firms have cut their targets. Pac Crest's Weston Twigg (Outperform, target cut by $4 to $23): "We are concerned that foundry demand is softening due to end-market weakness, which could last several quarters. Worse, if 16/14 nm ramps slow down, and 10 nm capacity is limited to smaller pilot lines next year, foundry capex could decline in 2016. We also expect Intel's capex to remain low next year as it maximizes equipment reuse amid low PC demand."Semiconductor Advisors' Robert Maire thinks company-specific issues are also weighing. "AMAT is better off than KLAC which is a purer play linked to the weak foundry/logic space but weaker than LRCX which has a better memory and multipatterning exposure. This dynamic is not likely to change in the near term given Applied's product mix including its process diagnostics group. Though AMAT may claim otherwise, we are not sure that AMAT is gaining significant share versus Lam overall."Jefferies' Sundeep Bajikar (Buy, target cut by $3 to $25) is still a believer. "Strong order growth and optimism about share gains in 3D NAND reinforces our secular thesis, and is likely to be a positive surprise for investors. While we believe our foundry competition thesis is also playing out, we misjudged timing of foundry orders. However, following CapEx cuts from TSMC and Intel we think foundry weakness was baked into the stock, which has declined 32% YTD (vs. SOX -8%) in spite of solid fundamentals. AMAT remains one of our top picks.”AMAT's FQ3 results, guidance/orders Aug. 14, 2015, 1:25 PM

Chip equipment stocks slump following Intel's capex budget cut, 10nm push-out
Applied Materials (AMAT -3.6%), ASML (ASML -4.9%), Lam Research (LRCX -4.2%), KLA-Tencor (KLAC -4.4%), Ultratech (UTEK -4.8%), Rudolph (RTEC -3.1%), Mattson (MTSN -2.4%), Advantest (ATE -2.6%), Teradyne (TER -0.9%), and Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC -1.2%) are lower (in spite of a 1.1% Nasdaq gain) after Intel cut its capex budget for the third time this year, this time by $1B to $7.7B (+/- $500M). The chip giant spent $10.1B on capex in 2014, and $10.7B-$11B in 2011-2013.Also: Intel disclosed it now expects to bring its first 10nm CPUs to market in 2H17, breaking with its historical 2-year manufacturing process upgrade pace and leading some to wonder if Moore's Law is proving harder to maintain. Intel's first 14nm CPUs (based on the Broadwell architecture) arrived last September.Separately, TSMC (cut its capex budget in April) provided cautious remarks about global chip demand. The world's biggest foundry expects 3% 2015 chip industry growth and 6%-10% foundry market growth.The selloff comes shortly after Applied and Lam provided aggressive 3-year EPS growth targets (I, II) at investor meetings held during the chip industry's Semicon West conference. ASML rallied yesterday following a Q2 beat and positive 2H15 outlook. Jul. 16, 2015, 12:40 PM
Applied Materials closes down 2.2% after setting FY18 guidance
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) gradually sold off after forecasting at an investor meeting it would achieve FY18 (ends Oct. '18) revenue of $11.6B and EPS of $2. For reference, FY15 consensus estimates are at $9.86B and $1.23.Notably, AMAT's forecast assumes global wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending of just $33.5B, with the company claiming a 21.9% share. Gartner forecast earlier this year WFE spend would total $33.7B in 2015 (up from $31.6B in 2014), and grow to $39.1B in 2018. Of course, that was before Intel and TSMC's capex budget cuts. Should 2018 WFE spend reach $37B, AMAT expects EPS of $2.33.The company expects revenue growth to drive $0.54 of EPS growth between now and FY18, and for gross margin gains and tax gains/buybacks to respectively provide $0.10 and $0.25 boosts. Opex growth is expected to act as an $0.08 headwind.~90% of expected chip equipment division (SSG) revenue growth of $1B+ is expected to come from share gains (paging David Einhorn). Services division (AGS) revenue is expected to grow by $450M+, and display and new products revenue by ~$250M.Investor meeting slides Jul. 14, 2015, 4:48 PM | 1 Comment
Einhorn exits NOK/EMC/MRVL, enters AMAT, defends MU, bashes NFLX
"When the company announced a confusing merger with Alcatel-Lucent ... we used the opportunity to exit with a healthy gain," writes David Einhorn in his Q2 letter, explaining Greenlight Capital's unloading of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) position.Regarding his decision to exit EMC, Einhorn cites "the reduced odds of any favorable change to the corporate structure and increasing concerns about a lack of growth in the storage business." EMC is 4 months removed from formally stating it doesn't plan to spin off its 80% VMware stake.Regarding Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), a position held for years, Einhorn cites weak PC demand as a reason for exiting following a 15% compounded annual return. His disclosure comes on a day Marvell rose 5.4% thanks to a report of buyout interest from a Chinese investment firm.Echoing the bullish arguments he has made for rival Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), Einhorn says he took a small position in Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) out of a belief AMAT's core etch/deposition equipment markets will outgrow the broader chip equipment industry "due to the increased use of 'multi-patterning' to produce chips at geometries below [20nm]." He predicts results will improve as management turns its attention from the abandoned Tokyo Electron merger towards "growth and cost savings opportunities." With Einhorn's help, AMAT rose 2.9% today."It's a cyclical business and, regrettably, we missed the turn of the cycle," says Einhorn about Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Greenlight's biggest Q2 loser. However, he still thinks the DRAM industry is acting more rationally following consolidation, notes shares trade at "less than 12x annualized trough earnings and less than 5x prior peak earnings," and predicts future cycles will have higher peaks and troughs.Over the long run, Einhorn expects Micron ($19.1B market cap) to be worth more than Netflix (NFLX - $42.9B market cap), whose recent surge he considers quite unjustified. "In today's market, the best performing stocks are companies with exciting stories where accountability is in the distant future." He adds Season 3 of House of Cards "appeared to be scripted to compete with Ambien,"Worth noting: While Einhorn has a good track record going long, his short picks have been more hit-and-miss.

The M&A waiting game
While mergers and acquisitions have accelerated sharply since the financial crisis, the government's pace for reviewing proposed deals is slowing.In such deal reviews concluded this year, more than 10 months elapsed, on average, between the transaction's announcement and a yes-or-no decision by the FTC or Justice Department. That's an increase from an average of seven months in recent years.Notables: Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWC) was pending for 14 months before it was dropped in April. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) walked away from its deal to acquire Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELY) 19 months after it was announced, while the FTC spent more than a year examining Sysco's (NYSE:SYY) planned acquisition of U.S. Foods before bringing a lawsuit against it in February.

Applied Materials rises on FQ2 beat, healthy orders
After beating FQ2 estimates, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is guiding for FQ3 revenue to be up 2%-6% Q/Q and EPS to be in a range of $0.31-$0.35. That's in-line with a consensus for 3% Q/Q revenue growth (to $2.52B) and EPS of $0.33.Orders/backlog: FQ2 orders totaled $2.52B, +11% Q/Q and -4% Y/Y, and topping revenue of $2.44B (1.03 book-to-bill). Chip equipment division orders +19% Q/Q to $1.7B; services orders -7% to $641M; display equipment orders +12% to $120M; energy/environmental (solar) orders flat at $50M. Backlog was flat Q/Q at $2.78B, thanks to negative adjustments of $69M.Chip equipment order breakdown: 36% foundry, 31% DRAM, 21% flash, 12% logic/other. Foundry, flash, and DRAM orders grew Q/Q (Samsung and TSMC's investments likely helped), while logic/other (Intel's capex budget cut likely hurt) fell. Services orders were hurt by a seasonal decline in contract renewals; display orders benefited from TV equipment demand.Financials: Gross margin was 43.2%, +90 bps Q/Q and -100 bps Y/Y. Excluding one-time charges, GAAP operating expenses rose 4% Y/Y to $614M - $365M was spent on R&D, $109M on sales/marketing, and $140M on G&A. Op. margin fell to 19.5% from 20.5% a year ago.AMAT +2% AH to $20.25.FQ2 results, PR May 14, 2015, 4:25 PM | 1 Comment

AMAT -7.8% on cancelled merger; $3B buyback launched
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) has tumbled towards $20 following news it has cancelled its planned $29B merger with Tokyo Electron, following a DOJ rejection of Applied/Tokyo's proposed remedies.The merger would've created a company that controlled about a quarter of global chip equipment spend, prior to any divestments. Several peers have rallied, perhaps aided by hopes they'll now be targeted.In an attempt to soften the blow, Applied has launched a new $3B buyback. It's good for repurchasing 11% of shares at current levels, and lasts through the third quarter of FY18.Stifel's Patrick Ho (Buy) is "surprised by the [DOJ's] ruling," given limited product overlap that could've been addressed via remedies. "In our view, persistent customer 'complaints' likely made it more difficult for regulators to approve the deal ... we believe that a great deal of focus has been placed on trying to complete this deal and while we believe Applied Materials is still well positioned to capitalize on these emerging industry inflections, there is a feeling of 'wasted energy' in this long tedious process..."Needham's Edwin Mok (Hold) thinks Applied is better off without Tokyo: He argues cultural differences would've limited operational synergies, thinks Tokyo has seen "accelerated share loss" since the 2013 merger announcement, and believes "AMAT alone is better leveraged to increased [etching/deposition equipment] intensity at the leading edge and is likely to see greater growth trajectory ahead."

TSMC cuts capex budget by $1B; AMAT posts 3% drop
Two days after Intel cut its 2015 capex budget by $1.3B to $8.7B (+/- $500M), TSMC (NYSE:TSM) has used its Q1 report to cut its 2015 capex budget by $1B to $10.5B-$11.5B.Co-CEO Mark Liu: "We think semiconductor industry growth this year has indeed adjusted down from 5% earlier to 4%. It’s really due to the macroeconomic situation around the world. The foundry growth rate will adjust down too. We’re looking at about 10%."CFO Lora Ho notes there's 90% commonality in equipment used by TSMC's 20nm process and its next-gen 16nm FinFET process (the focus of much of this year's spending). Co-CEO C.C. Wei states TSMC's 16nm ramp is going faster than expected thanks to improving yields; volume production is expected to start in Q3.The world's biggest foundry is still set to spend more on capex than it did in 2014 ($9.52B), something that can't be said for Intel. Samsung has been forecast by IC Insights to spend $11.3B on chip capex this year, as it ramps 14nm production and expands DRAM/NAND output.Chip equipment giant Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) sold off in regular trading following the news. AMAT also briefly dropped in response to Intel's capex cut, but closed higher the next day amid a chip stock rally.Earlier: TSMC off slightly after Q1 EPS beat, light Q2 sales guidance Apr. 16, 2015, 6:34 PM
Chip equipment stocks slide after Intel cuts capex budget
Intel has used its Q1 report to cut its 2015 capex budget by $1.3B to $8.7B (+/- $500M). The midpoint of the guidance range implies a 14% drop from a 2014 level of $10.1B, which itself was below 2011-2013 levels of $10.7B-$11B.Several chip equipment makers are lower AH in response. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) -1.4%. KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) -1.5%. Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) -1.4%. Kulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ:KLIC) -0.8%.In January, TSMC set an aggressive 2015 capex budget of $11.5B-$12B; Samsung is also expected to spend heavily this year. Between them, Intel, TSMC, and Samsung account for roughly half of all chip equipment capex.

AMAT +4.7%; Korean regulators approve Tokyo Electron deal
South Korea's Fair Trade Commission plans to conditionally approve Applied Materials'  (NASDAQ:AMAT) merger with Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF +5%). The regulator adds it's talking with peers in six countries (inc. the U.S. and Japan) to nail down details for approving a deal.A government official says Applied/Tokyo have agreed "not to launch combined chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) businesses in Korea," and to also "establish new entities for fair competition, if necessary."The announcement comes after Samsung and SK Hynix had voiced objections to the deal, which stands to create a colossus possessing ~25% of the global chip equipment market. The DOJ was reported in December to be vetting a buyer for assets Applied/Tokyo plan to divest to win U.S. regulatory approval.Separately, Applied has filed proxy materials for its 2015 annual meeting (set for April 2). The company discloses CEO Gary Dickerson's compensation rose 59% in 2014 to $16.4M, thanks in part to a cash grant meant to avoid an excise tax that would apply to stock option awards following the closing of the Tokyo Electron deal.

Applied Materials, ASML slip on KLA's soft guidance
Applied Materials (AMAT -1.7%) and ASML (ASML -1.5%) are off moderately after chip equipment peer KLA-Tencor (KLAC -7.1%) offered soft guidance (for the third quarter in a row) to go with an FQ2 beat. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%On the CC (transcript), CEO Rick Wallace stated KLA has seen orders from both foundry and logic clients for sub-20nm manufacturing equipment "pushed to later in the calendar year." KLA thinks the delays "reflect yield and process stability issues associated with bringing these advanced device architectures to market."In July and October, KLA primarily referenced foundry clients when explaining its light guidance. The logic client reference could be about Intel (by the far the biggest of them), which provided a conservative 2015 capex budget last week.Wallace also mentioned some orders related to "trailing-edge" manufacturing processes have been "a bit elusive," and that (notably) KLA thinks this is due to "some competitive dynamics in terms of second source strategies and so on."Analysts pressed KLA regarding its foundry-related issues, given TSMC is spending heavily and ASML reported strong Taiwanese foundry bookings (presumably from TSMC) earlier this week. On the other hand, memory was a strong point for both KLA and ASML in calendar Q4, respectively accounting for 44% and 27% of the companies' bookings. Jan. 23, 2015, 2:25 PM
Chip equipment firms take Intel/TSMC's capex budgets in stride
A day after some industry names outperformed modestly following news TSMC (NYSE:TSM) set a high 2015 capex budget of $11.5B-$12B, chip equipment makers generally traded in-line with a rising tech sector after another one of their big-3 customers, Intel, set a conservative 2015 capex budget of $9.5B-$10.5B.TSMC's 2015 budget is well above a 2014 capex level of $9.52B; the world's biggest foundry is both trying to keep up with rising mobile chip orders, and investing heavily to roll out its 16nm FinFET/FinFET+ processes to counter Samsung and Globalfoundries' 14nm FinFET rollouts.The midpoint of Intel's 2015 budget is slightly below 2014 spending of $10.1B, which itself was below prior guidance of $10.5B-$11.5B. It's also below 2011-2013 spending of $10.7B-$11B.Some cautiousness from Intel might have been expected: Gartner recently forecast industry capex would rise just 0.8% this year to $65.8B, albeit with wafer fab spend rising a healthier 6.7% to $33.7B. Gartner forecast memory capex would rise 13.5% and foundry capex 4.8%, but predicted logic capex (much of it from Intel) would decline 5.3%.Also: TSMC has disclosed it sold the 21M-share stake it took in ASML in 2012 for $1.5B, booking a $660M profit along the way. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung each invested in ASML with the goal of accelerating its EUV lithography R&D efforts (viewed as necessary to maintain Moore's Law long-term).Between them, Intel, TSMC, and Samsung account for over half of industry capex.Chip equipment firms: AMAT, KLAC, LRCX, TER, KLIC, ACLS, UTEK, RTEC, MTSN, ATE, XCRA, OTCPK:TOELF Jan. 16, 2015, 7:17 PM

Report: DOJ could clear Applied-Tokyo deal following asset sale
The DOJ is "vetting a buyer of assets to be divested" by Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF) to win approval for their still-pending merger, TheStreet reports. The DOJ issued a second request for information back in Dec. 2013, three months after the deal was first announced.Meanwhile, the Korea Times has reported Samsung, originally opposed to the deal, is urging Korean regulators to approve it after forming a new partnership with AMAT related to next-gen memory chip technologies. Korean approval is deemed likely to arrive "sometime in March or April."Chinese and Japanese regulators also still have to vet the deal, which stands to create an industry giant. Morningstar observed last year Applied/Tokyo will have a 40% or greater share in six chip equipment markets.TheStreet observes Tokyo, whose shareholders will own 32% of the merged company, still traded at a 10% discount to the merger price as of Monday.

Berenberg bullish on Applied and Lam, cautious on KLA and ASML
Berenberg's Tammy Qiu declares Applied Materials (AMAT - Buy reiterated) and Lam Research (LRCX - launched at Buy) to be two of her favorite chip equipment plays ahead of an expected 2015/2016 slowdown in semi capex.Like David Einhorn and others, Qiu expects Lam to gain chip equipment share thanks to strong exposure to the FinFET (3D transistor) etching and 3D NAND flash deposition/etching markets.Applied is expected to benefit from both FinFET/3D NAND exposure and Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF) merger synergies. Qiu: "We believe TEL can improve its margin following the merger with AMAT, from single-digit to above 20%, by exiting non-profitable business, optimizing operations and platform alignment with AMAT."She's less enthusiastic about KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) and ASML, launching the former at Hold and reiterating a Hold on the latter.  Though liking KLA's process control share (helps with regards to FinFET exposure), Qiu considers shares fairly valued at 21x estimated FY15 (ends June '15) EPS.ASML, meanwhile, is expected to see a relatively slow EUV sales ramp. Qiu expects ASML to ship only 40 EUV tools in 2019, below management's guidance for 50-60. In addition, sales of ArFi lithography tools are expected to "decline over time due to re-use and efficiency improvements."Altogether, Qiu forecasts semi capex will grow just 2% in 2015 and decline 7% in 2016, after growing 12% in 2014. Memory capex is expected to fare better than foundry/logic capex. Nov. 28, 2014, 2:32 PM

Three weeks after providing a calendar Q3 warning that triggered a massive chip stock rout, Microchip (MCHP +7.3%) has provided Q4 guidance that's in-line with lowered estimates. The microcontroller vendor, which has often seen trends emerge ahead of peers, also said it saw most of its inventory correction in Q3, and expects Q4 sales to be just "slightly below typical seasonal levels."Chip stocks are up strongly (SOXX +4%) on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.4%. Since Microchip's warning, a slew of analog chipmakers and microcontroller firms (e.g. Atmel, Freescale, STMicro, Intersil, Linear) have offered light Q4 guidance, and other firms have reported seeing high-end Android weakness (e.g. Synaptics, Cirrus Logic, Amkor).On the other hand, several mobile chipmakers (Skyworks, RF Micro, TriQuint, Silicon Motion), some of which have decent iPhone exposure, have provided strong results and/or guidance. Other chipmakers, such as Broadcom, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx, have rallied after delivering in-line guidance.Susquehanna's Chris Caso: "By now, we think it’s clear that the weakness MCHP saw in September is not company specific ... The question now is if the full extent of the weakness has been dialed into estimates. If it has, then this would be among the shortest and mildest downturns in many years."Notable gainers: SNDK +3.9%. MU +4.1%. AMAT +3.9%. TXN +4.7%. NXPI +3.9%. NVDA +3.5%. MXIM +4.7%. LLTC +5.1%. FCS +9.6%. FSL +8.8%.  ADI +6.5%. TQNT +6.8%. RFMD +6.5%. ATML +5.9%. AVGO +5.1%. MRVL +4.7%. AMCC +8.9%. BRCM +3.6%. TSM +4.4%. ARMH +3.3%.Intel (INTC +3.5%) has recovered most of the losses it saw yesterday due to Intesil's (ISIL +3.3%) results and guidance, and related comments about a PC chip inventory correction.Chip ETFs: SMH, XSD, PSI, SOXL, USD, SOXS, SSG Oct. 31, 2014, 11:31 AM | 17 Comments
Tokyo Electron, Applied Materials merger may be delayed
Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF), which is expected to be acquired by Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), has announced that the completion of their merger could take until next year due to delays in regulatory approvals.Applied Materials agreed to buy Tokyo Electron in September of last year in an all-stock deal worth more than $10B, combining the two makers of chip-making gear as demand for their products slowed.

BofA upgrades AMAT, sees $1.80/share in EPS post-merger
Declaring Applied Materials' (AMAT -2.1%) recent selloff has made shares "very attractive," BofA/Merrill's Krish Sankar has upgraded the chip equipment giant to Buy, while reiterating a $25 target.Though bullish on the semi capital equipment cycle, Sankar argues Applied is "more of a restructuring story, making it cycle-agnostic in the intermediate term and not as susceptible to the noise around demand/yield."He sees the Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF) merger (still being pored over by regulators) potentially closing in Q1, and thinks the post-merger company will have normalized earnings power of $1.80/share, assuming the wafer fab equipment market is worth $31B - Gartner has forecast $30.8B in 2014, and $34.1B in 2015. That implies shares only trade at 10x-11x normalized EPS.Moreover, if the deal somehow fails to clear, Sankar only sees Applied falling to the $17-$18 range.The upgrade hasn't done much to lift Applied, which is following the market lower. CLSA upgraded the company last week.

Intel, other chip stocks hit hard by Microchip's warning
Microchip's (MCHP -12.5%) calendar Q3 warning, which was accompanied by a declaration that it believes "another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future," is taking a heavy toll on chip stocks (SOXX -5.5%).Intel (INTC -4.2%) and many other chipmakers have joined the several firms that sold off AH yesterday in going in the same direction as Microchip: MU -5.8%. FSL -8.5%. BRCM -3.6%. SWKS -7.5%. RFMD -6.2%. XLNX -4.9%. MXIM -5%. AMBA -5.5%. IDTI -6.7%. CAVM -7.4%. AVGO -10.2%. SMTC -4.3%. SYNA -4.1%. POWI -6.9%.Chip equipment makers are also getting hit: AMAT -3.5%. KLAC -3.3%. LRCX -2.3%. UTEK -2.5%. KLIC -2%.As Microchip noted in yesterday's warning, the company's very diversified customer base, together with its recognition of distributor revenue on a customer sell-through basis rather than a distributor sell-in basis, often allow it to see industry changes before peers.The microcontroller vendor added its warning was driven by a September decline in sales to Chinese clients, and observed it has typically "returned to sequential revenue growth after two quarters" during past downturns.Chip stocks have had a good run over the last 12 months, aided by healthy mobile demand and the industry's consolidation wave.

Applied Materials lands two-notch CLSA upgrade
CLSA has upgraded Applied Material (AMAT +0.7%) to Outperform from Underperform. However, its target has only risen by $1 to $23.The firm expects AMAT to benefit from 14nm/16nm FinFET investments - Samsung, Globalfoundries, and TSMC all plan to invest heavily - and considers fears related to the pending Tokyo Electron merger overblown.

AMAT surges as Street applauds outlook; KLAC, LRCX also gain
Applied Materials'  (AMAT +6.3%) FQ4 guidance demonstrates its business is less cyclical than that of rivals KLA-Tencor (KLAC +1.4%) and Lam Research (LRCX +1.5%), argues Nomura. Whereas AMAT is guiding for flat Q/Q Oct. quarter revenue, KLA and Lam (more dependent on big foundry orders) are respectively forecasting 16% and 8% drops before expected rebounds.Nomura is also a fan of AMAT's strong Chinese display equipment exposure, and notes overlap with merger partner Tokyo Electron's (OTCPK:TOELF +5%) display ops is low.Jefferies echoes Lam Research's management (previous) by predicting technology inflections such as "a faster-than-expected 14nm FinFET ramp and a shift to flexible OLED by Samsung" will act as catalysts for AMAT over the next 6-18 months.Credit Suisse is more cautious: It likes AMAT's margin improvement, share gains, and exposure to display/solar recoveries, but also considers Lam a better play on investments in FinFET (3D transistors), multi-patterning, and 3D NAND flash. AMAT gets ~40% of its chip equipment revenue from chemical vapor deposition and etching products (account for a large portion of spending on cutting-edge processes), while Lam gets ~90%.

Applied guides in-line; margin gains fuel EPS beat
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) expects FQ4 revenue to be roughly flat Q/Q (+/- 3%), and for EPS to be in a range of $0.25-$0.29. The consensus is for sub-1% revenue growth and EPS of $0.26.FQ3 orders totaled $2.48B, -6% Q/Q and +24% Y/Y, and good for a book-to-bill of 1.09. Chip equipment orders -6% Q/Q to $1.57B; display equipment -13% to $296M; energy/environmental (solar) -25% to $66M; global services +3% to $552M. Backlog rose 9% to $2.97B.Chip equipment orders were pressured by soft DRAM/foundry demand - peers have already reported of a summer lull ahead of an expected Q4/2015 pickup. Though down Q/Q, display orders remain high due to TV manufacturing investments.Gross margin rose 130 bps Q/Q and 260 bps Y/Y to 45.5%, fueling the EPS beat. GAAP opex rose 8% Y/Y to $601M.AMAT +1.8% AH. FQ3 results, PR. Aug. 14, 2014, 4:22 PM

AMAT, ASML, others underperform following KLA's light guidance
KLA-Tencor (KLAC -1.9%) guided on its FQ4 CC (transcript) for FQ1 revenue of $590M-$650M (-6% Y/Y at the midpoint) and EPS of $0.34-$0.54, well below a consensus of $740M and $0.88. Bookings are expected to drop to $600M-$800M from an FQ4 level of $898M (topped guidance of $625M-$825M).Several chip equipment peers underperformed following the numbers on a weak day for stocks. AMAT -2.4%. ASML -2%. RTEC -3.5%. UCTT -3.2%. MTSN -2.3%. The group has had a good run this year on optimism about industry consolidation and a strong up-cycle.Discussing its guidance, KLA observed delivery for major FQ4 orders for 14nm equipment from a foundry client (likely Samsung or Globalfoundries) isn't expected to start until FQ2. The company added it's generally cautious about 2014 foundry revenue.But KLA expects revenue growth to resume in FQ2, and is optimistic about 2015 demand, as foundry clients (responsible for 68% of FQ4 orders) invest heavily to ramp 16nm and 14nm production. Samsung and Globalfoundries have big 14nm plans for 2015; TSMC is attempting to counter with its 16nm FinFET+ process.FQ4 gross margin was 56%, missing KLA's guidance midpoint by 150 bps and contributing to an EPS miss. KLA blames product mix and higher-than-expected services costs. GM is expected to fall to 54%-55% in FQ1 due to lower revenue. Jul. 25, 2014, 4:58 PM
Chip equipment roundup: AMAT bulls, KLAC caution, 3D NAND, SEMI forecast
Applied Materials (AMAT) "made a compelling case that technology inflections could become tailwinds [for chip equipment demand] at the FinFET and 3D NAND transitions," writes Credit Suisse's John Pitzer after taking in the firm's analyst day (held at the Semicon West conference).Pitzer adds AMAT sees $10B+ in cumulative revenue opportunities from the deposition and etching markets related to 3D NAND flash investments. However, he thinks Lam Research (LRCX), which just offered a bullish analyst day outlook of its own, is a better 3D NAND play.Cowen's Timothy Arcuri argues strong FinFET (3D transistor) and 3D NAND capacity targets, together with healthy maintenance spend, "argues more re-rating for AMAT and the sector in general." At the same time, he's worried about the impact of 3D NAND growth on NAND supply, and thus the multiples afforded to SanDisk (SNDK), which has rallied strongly this year.AMAT remains confident the Tokyo Electron (TOELF) merger will close this year. The post-merger company will call itself Eteris. Analyst Robert Maire thinks AMAT/Tokyo will buy Entegris (ENTG) once the deal closes.KLA-Tencor (KLAC), though hiking its June quarter guidance, is a little cautious about near-term demand. "This is a quarter where we believe we're in a bit of a pause right now in the industry ... Bookings that we got, while strong, were really for foundry, and more for delivery and revenues that we'll see in calendar '15." Berenberg issued a cautious note last week.Trade group SEMI now expects total chip equipment spend to grow 20.8% in 2014 to $38.4B, and 10.8% in 2015 to $42.6B.Other industry names: ASML, UTEK, RTEC, KLIC, MTSN, ASMI, MKSI

Applied Materials ticks higher on JPMorgan upgrade
Applied Materials (AMAT +1.1%) has been upgraded to Overweight by JPMorgan. The firm cites AMAT's chip equipment market positioning, optimism about a healthy market up-cycle, and a belief the Tokyo Electron (TOELF) merger will close in 2014.Like others, JPM is upbeat about the synergies that will come from a merger set to create a company controlling ~1/4 of the global chip equipment market. "Management teams at both companies remain on focus to drive meaningful cost synergies post-deal closure and drive solid profit margin expansion and EPS growth over the next 18 - 24 months."AMAT now +32% YTD, aided by solid order growth, expectations for rising orders from memory and logic/foundry clients amid investments in new processes (3D NAND, FinFET, etc.), and a belief industry consolidation will strengthen the hand of equipment vendors.The industry's Semicon West conference starts tomorrow. Credit Suisse expects AMAT and peers to offer upbeat commentary for both 2H14 and 2015 demand. Berenberg is more cautious, arguing conservative spending from Intel, Samsung, and TSMC presents downside risk. Jul. 7, 2014, 10:20 AM
Applied Materials +3.8% AH on strong order growth
Applied Materials (AMAT) expects FQ3 revenue to be flat to down 5% Q/Q, and for EPS to be in a range of $0.25-$0.29.

Lam Research, Ultratech fuel chip equipment stock rally
Lam Research (LRCX +11%) beat FQ3 estimates and guided on its CC (transcript) for FQ4 revenue of $1.19B-$1.29B and EPS of $1.14-$1.28, above a consensus of $1.16B and $1.09. Ultratech (UTEK +3.6%) missed Q1 estimates, but has reiterated guidance for 25%-30% 2014 revenue growth (above a 23.5% consensus).Just as importantly for the industry, Lam has forecast the global wafer fab equipment market will be worth $32B in 2014 - $1B more than what Gartner previously forecast.Lam also mentioned it has "seen some strengthening" in DRAM equipment orders - clients have been conservative with their capex following industry consolidation - and a "sustained commitment" among logic/foundry clients (Intel and TSMC?) to advanced processes (20nm, 3D transistors, etc.). However, there have been "some slight delays" in 3D NAND flash investments.Chip equipment peers are also up: AMAT +1.4%. KLAC +1.5%. ASML +2.1%. ACLS +1.6%. CAMT +5.3%. RTEC +1.5%. PLAB +3.4%. One notable exception is Teradyne (TER -4.1%), which provided light Q2 EPS guidance - $0.36-$0.43 vs. a consensus of $0.49 - to go with a Q1 beat. Revenue guidance is in-line.The group sold off last week after ASML offered soft guidance and a cautious 2H outlook. KLA reports after the bell. Apr. 24, 2014, 1:42 PM
Chip equipment stocks drop on ASML's guidance cut, commentary
ASML (ASML -5.5%) has lowered its 1H14 sales outlook. Moreover, the lithography equipment kingpin says logic IC customers are "encountering timing uncertainties in next-generation device designs" for 2H, and that NAND flash memory makers are "continuing their evaluation of [3D] NAND and future-node planar technologies, resulting in uncertainties for system demand."ASML's remarks about logic customers might partly be a reference to Intel, which has reportedly delayed the launch of its 14nm Broadwell CPUs. NAND vendors have been keeping a lid on capex for some time; recent price pressure might encourage them to do so.Chip equipment peers Applied Materials (AMAT -2%), KLA-Tencor (KLAC -2.5%), Lam Research (LRCX -2.5%), Axcelis (ACLS -2.6%), Camtek (CAMT -5.8%), and Ultratech (UTEK -0.9%) are off in sympathy. Compared with many other tech companies, the group has held up well during the March/April selloff.One silver lining: ASML says multiple customers are qualifying 10nm EUV lithography equipment, and that it expects to recognize revenue on 8 EUV systems in 2014. Investments in both EUV and 450mm wafers have been delayed.Gartner has forecast chip wafer fab equipment spend will grow 14.9% in 2014 to $31B, after falling 9.1% in 2013. Apr. 16, 2014, 11:40 AM
Intel, others slow migration to 450mm chip wafers
Lithography equipment giant ASML has "paused" the development of hardware meant to work with next-gen 450mm wafers, which offer 125% more wafer space (and thus better economies of scale) than current-gen 300mm wafers. Likewise, Applied Materials (AMAT) CEO Gary Dickerson says the 450mm migration "has definitely been pushed out from a timing standpoint."Due to ASML's move, Intel (INTC), which agreed in 2012 to pour $4.1B into the company to help finance investments in 450mm wafers and EUV lithography, has "adjusted" the pace of its payments to ASML.Last year, Intel began constructing a $2B Oregon development fab meant to be its first 450mm facility. But it's reevaluating its timetable amid soft PC demand and concerns about its share of the bill. Spokesman Chuck Mulloy: "We still believe 450 is the right thing to do ... But we have been clear: we will not do it ourselves."EUV, considered necessary to maintain Moore's Law long-term, has also seen delays. ASML CEO Peter Wennink recently predicted EUV will reach the stability levels required by chip manufacturers by the 2H16 or 2017.Other chip equipment makers: KLAC, LRCX, RTEC, NVMI, UTEK, TOELF Mar. 13, 2014, 6:37 PM | 6 Comments

Chip equipment stocks join selloff after Samsung forecast, KLA's earnings
Chip equipment stocks aren't getting spared from a general market selloff after Samsung (SSNLF - the world's #2 chipmaker) guided for its 2014 chip capex to be flat Y/Y. AMAT -1.6%. LRCX -3.7%. ASML -0.7%. UTEK -2.2%. RTEC -3.2%. MTSN -5.1%.Industry analyst Robert Marie observes this is the first time since 2009 that Samsung hasn't upped its chip capex budget. With Intel and TSMC (the industry's two other big clients) also guiding for capex to be flat (if not down) this year, Marie is cautious about 2014 growth, even though others have forecast sales will rebound sharply this year following a rough 2013.KLA-Tencor (KLAC -2.2%) is joining the selloff even though the company posted an FQ2 EPS beat yesterday afternoon, and provided healthy FQ3 guidance - revenue of $790M-$850M and EPS of $1-$1.20 vs. a consensus of $814.5M and $1.11 - on its CC (transcript). KLA also forecast FQ3 bookings will be in a range of $700M-$800M (implies 10% Q/Q growth at the midpoint), and struck an upbeat tone about 2014 investments in 20nm and 3D NAND flash capacity.KLA still expects 10%+ industry growth this year, but admits its outlook is "slightly weaker" than it was three months ago. The company also believes industry adoption of EUV lithography (important for ASML) has generally been pushed out to the 7nm process node from the 10nm node. Jan. 24, 2014, 2:08 PM
DOJ probing Applied Materials-Tokyo Electron deal
Applied Materials (AMAT) discloses the DOJ has provided it with a request for additional info related to its planned merger with fellow chip equipment giant Tokyo Electron (TOELF). AMAT still expects the deal to close in mid-2014 or 2H14.Many have expected the Applied-Tokyo deal would face close scrutiny, given it stands to create a company with a dominant position in several chip equipment markets, and a total industry share (25.5% in 2012, per Gartner) roughly twice that of #2 ASML (12.8% 2012 share).Morningstar's Andy Ng notes Applied/Tokyo will have a 40% or higher share in six markets - including the key etch (46% 2012 share) and deposition (59%) markets, which are expected to see solid growth as chipmakers ramp production of 3D NAND flash memory and chips featuring 3D/FinFET transistors. Lam Research (LRCX +0.4%) is Applied/Tokyo's biggest rival in each market.Nonetheless, Ng argues chipmakers will back the deal, given the rising cost/complexity of chip manufacturing and the need for equipment vendors with huge R&D resources and diverse skill sets.

KLA-Tencor slumps due to bookings forecast, takes peers lower with it
During a Credit Suisse conference talk, KLA-Tencor (KLAC -2.7%) CFO Bren Higgins stated his company's FQ2 (Dec. quarter) bookings could miss the midpoint of its guidance range. The potential shortfall is attributed to a $100M order push-out for reticle inspection tools used in the production of cutting-edge 10nm chips.KLA had guided on its FQ1 CC (transcript) for FQ2 bookings of $800M-$950M ($875M midpoint), up from FQ1's $790M and well above revenue guidance of $670M-$730M.Susquehanna's Mehdi Hosseini, who rates KLA a Negative, is "puzzled" by Higgins' explanation, given Intel (long at the bleeding edge of chip manufacturing) is the only company investing in 10nm R&D for now - the chip giant is just getting set to mass-produce 14nm chips - and that KLA's reticle inspection bookings have been in the ~$70M range in recent quarters.The reticle inspection market has been a weak spot for KLA. However, during an upbeat September conference talk, Higgins said demand was improving.Chip equipment sales have been expected to improve in 2014: Trade group SEMI just estimated sales will rise 23% in 2014, after dropping 13% in 2013.Several chip equipment peers have followed KLA lower: AMAT -3%. ASML -2.5%. LRCX -2.9%. RTEC -1.5%. MTSN -2.5%. Dec. 4, 2013, 4:49 PM
Applied Materials' guidance disappoints, but orders pick up
Applied Materials (AMAT) is guiding for 3%-10% Q/Q FQ1 revenue growth, and quarterly EPS of $0.20-$0.24.

Book-to-bill was 1.05, better than FQ3's 1.01.Ahead of the Tokyo Electron merger, chip equipment division orders rose 16% Q/Q to $1.39B (67% of all orders) after dropping 22% in FQ3. Foundry, flash memory, and logic-related orders all rose, while DRAM-related orders fell.Global services orders rose 6% Q/Q to $548M after rising 7% in FQ3. Display equipment orders plunged 55% to $114M after rising 31% in FQ3. Solar equipment orders more than doubled Q/Q, but still only totaled $40M.$245M was spent on buybacks.

Applied Materials optimistic that deal will be approved
Applied Materials (AMAT) Executive Chairman Mike Splinter is confident that while regulators will take a "close look" at the company's proposed $7.1B acquisition of Tokyo Electron (TOELF.PK), the firm is "confident it will get approved."Splinter doubts that overlap between Applied Materials' and Tokyo Electron's product lines will be a problem. "Where we actually compete, there is very, very little overlap," Splinter said.Despite Splinter's optimism, top chip manufacturers such as Intel, Samsung, and TSMC could object to the deal.The companies believe that they'll gain three points in market share from the merger, as well as improve the supply chain, save money and become more efficient.

Applied-Tokyo deal could face tough scrutiny, tax benefits expected
Given the huge market shares Applied Materials (AMAT) and Tokyo Electron (TOELF.PK) stand to have in a many chip/display equipment verticals post-merger, antitrust regulators are expected to closely scrutinize the $29B deal. Top chip manufacturers such as Intel, Samsung, and TSMC could be among those to object to it, at least in the absence of some asset sales.Gartner estimates Applied (14.4% share) and Tokyo (11.1% share) had over 1/4 of the global chip equipment market between them in 2012. ASML is assigned a 12.8% share, Lam Research (LRCX) 7.4%, and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) 6.5%.If the deal goes through, it should bring some tax benefits on account of the post-merger company's plans to incorporate in The Netherlands (ASML's home turf). A source tells the FT the combined company will have a tax rate of just 17%.Some analysts see the merger, like other recent deals, being motivated by the chip equipment industry's secular challenges. "It's all cyclical and no growth," remarks S&P's Angelo Zito.Unsurprisingly, Applied offers a more positive take, arguing demand for cutting-edge mobile chips and the industry's race to commercialize EUV lithography (expected in the second half of the decade) presents growth opportunities for companies with superior products. Pac Crest made a similar argument yesterday, while recommending Applied, KLA, and Lam.Gartner thinks chip equipment sales will fall 8.5% in 2013 to $34.6B after dropping 16.1% in 2012. But it also sees sales gradually rising to $49.1B in 2017.Previous: merger announcement, details Sep. 24, 2013, 6:56 PM | 1 Comment
Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron to have dual HQs, $12B+ in sales
Applied Materials (AMAT +6.4%) continues to shoot higher after announcing a $29B all-stock merger with fellow chip/LCD equipment maker Tokyo Electron (TOELF.PK), a move that stands to create an industry behemoth. Among chip equipment peers, only ASML (ASML +1.4%) comes close to matching AMAT/Tokyo Electron in size.ASML and Lam Research (LRCX +2.1%) are up moderately in response to the deal, while KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is nearly unchanged. Tokyo Electron closed up 11.7% in Japan.Tokyo Electron had FY13 (ended March '13) revenue of ¥497.3B ($5.03B). Applied is expected to generate FY13 (ends Oct. '13) revenue of $7.53B.The combined company will have dual HQs in Tokyo and Santa Clara (there could be both integration and cultural challenges). Tokyo Electron chairman/CEO Tetsuro Higashi will be chairman, while new/well-respected Applied CEO Gary Dickerson will be CEO.Applied and Tokyo assert the merged company's unmatched materials engineering capabilities will give it an edge in the mobile chip and display equipment markets. The deal is expected to close in "mid to second half of 2014."The chip equipment industry has already seen plenty of consolidation; the Lam Research-Novellus and ASML-Cymer deals are two notable examples. Will Applied-Tokyo Electron fuel additional M&A activity? Sep. 24, 2013, 10:00 AM

Applied Materials to merge with Tokyo Electron
Chipmaker Applied Materials (AMAT) will merge with Tokyo Electron in an all-stock combination that values the combined firm at $29B."The combination will accelerate our momentum for profitable growth, increase the value delivered to shareholders and create great opportunities for employees," AMAT CEO Gary Dickerson says.The terms of the deal call for AMAT shareholders (who will own 68% of the new firm) to receive 1 share of the combined company for every AMAT share they hold.Run-rate operating synergies are expected to be $250M by the end of the first year and $500M in three years.Taking into account a planned $3B buyback, the deal will be EPS accretive at the end of the first fiscal year after closing. (PR)AMAT +3% premarket. Sep. 24, 2013, 6:38 AM | 4 Comments
KLA-Tencor, Applied Materials, Lam Research rally following bullish talks
During a Citi conference talk (transcript), KLA (KLAC +5.5%) CFO Bren Higgins said he was "encouraged by some things" he has seen in 2H, such as strong investments in the next-gen 20nm manufacturing process (TSMC and Samsung are both moving aggressively), "pretty solid" demand for 28nm gear, improving demand in the reticle inspection market (a weak spot as of late) and "increasing momentum" for 3D NAND flash production (Samsung is an early adopter).Altogether, Higgins thinks KLA's 2H revenue can total $1.5B or more. Analysts currently expect 2H revenue of $1.42B.Higgins also asserted KLA's dominant position in the process control portion of the chip equipment market (~58% share) will allow it to gain equipment share during the coming up cycle, given much of the growth will be driven by mobile chips made by foundries and logic IC firms (historically the biggest buyers of process control hardware).Applied Materials (AMAT +3.3%) CFO Bob Halliday was nearly as upbeat during his Citi talk (transcript), asserting his company benefits from both 3D NAND investments and the adoption of 3D (FinFET) transistors by the likes of Intel and TSMC. Long-term, the use of more advanced materials in FinFET production is viewed as a growth driver.Halliday also mentioned AMAT is open to making new acquisitions, and (in spite of improving conditions) will be "very, very careful" in terms of how it invests in solar due to industry overcapacity.Peer Lam Research (LRCX +5.6%) also presented today, and also closed sharply higher. ASML +1.4%. MTSN +2.9%. UTEK +2.2%. RTEC +2.2%. Sep. 4, 2013, 4:45 PM
Northland starts coverage on chip equipment stocks
Applied Materials (AMAT +0.1%), ASML (ASML -0.6%), Lam Research (LRCX +0.4%), and Brooks Automation (BRKS +2.1%) have been started at Outperform, and KLA-Tencor (KLAC +0.9%) and Mattson (MTSN -0.9%) have been started at Market Perform.The firm argues new leadership, an expected chip equipment up cycle, and "industry timing for new technology inflection points" will benefit Applied.It views Lam as having "the best share gain potential" among large-cap equipment makers (its 20nm process strength is cited), and sees the company getting a lift from rising memory capex.Northland thinks ASML can outgrow the wafer fab equipment market (expected by Gartner to grow 17% next year), and expects the Cymer acquisition to lift margins.It offers a more subdued take on KLA, asserting the company's "historical growth premium versus the industry could be peaking," even as it benefits from investments in next-gen manufacturing processes. Northland also believes Applied is set to "become more competitive" relative to KLA. Aug. 28, 2013, 9:50 AM
Solar stocks continue rallying, with help from Trina
Solar stocks, among the biggest standouts in a year that has been very good to many high-beta tech names, have staged a strong two-day rally in the wake of Trina's (TSL +13.2%) Q2 beat and guidance hike.Trina's numbers have sparked three upgrades, the most recent of which came today, courtesy of Cowen.Bloomberg notes Trina, SunPower (SPWR +4.3%), and JinkoSolar (JKS +5.6% - just announced a new 23MW supply deal) are all operating at full capacity, and thinking of expanding.S&P's Angelo Zino: "I think it’s safe to say that we’ll see a number of tier-one manufacturers add capacity, probably in 2014."That would be a positive for equipment suppliers such as AMAT, GTAT, and VECO, who have seen their solar orders plummet as module makers scramble to stabilize crashing prices and margins.Other names rising today: CSIQ +9.7%. SOL +6.7%. YGE +6.2%. JASO +4.2%. CSUN +5.4%. ASTI +5.1%. STP +3.8%. LDK +4.1%. Aug. 21, 2013, 1:06 PM | 3 Comments

Intel (INTC) now -4.4% AH following its Q2 report, thanks to downbeat CC remarks. The chip giant says channel inventory has grown following the Haswell launch, and (as reflected in Gartner/IDC's Q2 numbers) that Chinese sales have weakened. The chip giant also admits 2H visibility is limited for now. Intel is banking on improving macro conditions and a flurry of Haswell/Bay Trail notebook, tablet, and convertible launches later this year to lift sales. RBC and Bernstein aren't sure if Intel has lowered guidance enough. AMD -0.7% and HPQ -0.6% in sympathy. AMAT -0.5% thanks to the capex guidance cut.

Global chip sales rose 3.4% M/M in May, per the SIA's latest data. On a 3-month rolling average basis, they rose 4.6% M/M but just 1.3% Y/Y. Analysts are generally pleased. Though Evercore still expects a weak 2H, JPMorgan (6% 2013 growth forecast) notes sales are picking up following a weak Q1; Wedbush thinks both the data and its own checks suggest a chip recovery "continues at a healthy and steady pace;" and Wells Fargo (8%-10% 2013 forecast) likes the fact IC sales rose 6% Y/Y. Wells adds the ratio of chip equipment sales to IC sales remains low at 14%, which suggests equipment orders will eventually pick up. Chip equipment makers: AMAT, KLAC, LRCX, ASML, UTEK, RTEC.

Chip equipment stocks are rallying thanks to strong results and better-than-feared guidance from KLA-Tencor (KLAC +8.8%), and Samsung's forecast for 2013 capex to be similar to 2012 levels. AMAT +2.4%. LRCX +5.6%. ASML +3.2%. CYMI +2.8%. RTEC +1.7%. There had been a lot of speculation Samsung would aggressively slash its capex budget this year. Samsung foundry rival TSMC (TSM -1%) is lower. Jan. 25, 2013, 11:39 AM
A little more on Intel: 2013 capex budget of $12.5B-$13.5B established, up from 2012's $11B (good for chip equipment makers). $1B in shares repurchased, boosting Q4 EPS. Company expects gross margin (GAAP) to be 56%-60% in Q1 and 60% (plus or minus a few %) in 2013. Opex expected to increase 4% in 2013, headcount expected to be flat after rising by 5K in 2012. 2012 software sales totaled $2.4B (+27% Y/Y, boosted by full year of McAfee results).

Down initially following its Q4 report, ASML (ASML +8%) is now rallying strongly. Though revenue was below estimates, EPS was above, and the lithography giant guided for 2013 sales to be "at a similar level to that of 2012" thanks to a 2H demand pickup. That's going over well in light of bleak industry forecasts. ASML sees investments in advanced 14-20nm processes driving demand, though it expects the memory industry to "continue investing at a minimum level" (a positive for SNDK and MU). CYMI +6.2%.

That's easily worse than prior forecasts of -13.3% and -0.8%, and is blamed on soft memory capex (perhaps a positive for MU and SNDK) and slow improvement in capacity utilization rates, which are expected to be under 80% at year's end. Applied Materials (AMAT) has already forecast a 5%-15% drop in industry sales in 2013, and TSMC recently provided slightly disappointing capex guidance. Dec. 18, 2012, 2:32 PM | 1 Comment
TSMC (TSM) is setting a 2013 capex budget of $9B, below prior reports of $10B and arguably a negative for chip equipment makers who have been hoping TSMC's spending would offset weakness at Samsung and perhaps also Intel. But then again, shares of equipment vendors have already priced in a fair amount of bad news. Also, TSMC is forecasting 2013 revenue growth of 15%-20%, well above a 9.9% consensus, as its mobile exposure allows it to soundly outpace chip industry growth.

Applied Materials (AMAT) is putting both its hard-luck display and solar equipment ops under the leadership of Ali Salehpour, most recently head of a chip equipment unit at rival KLA-Tencor (KLAC). Mark Pintor and Tom Edman, until now the respective heads of Applied's display and solar ops, will be leaving. Applied's FQ4 display and solar equipment orders totaled just $148M, down 73% from two years ago. Nov. 28, 2012, 5:23 PM | 1 Comment
Applied Materials (AMAT -1%) now expects the chip equipment industry to contract by 5%-15% in 2013, a forecast easily worse than a recent Gartner estimate for a 0.8% increase. Applied, which offered soft FQ1 guidance yesterday to go with its FQ4 beat, mentioned on its earnings call it expects chip wafer starts and utilization rates to drop again in FQ1. Its outlook for solar equipment demand is predictably bleak, though the company is a little more optimistic about a rebound in LCD equipment orders.

In another piece of bad news for the chip equipment industry, a Korean paper reports Samsung (SSNLF.PK) may delay the construction of a new non-memory chip plant, citing macro issues. The plant saw construction begin in June, and is currently scheduled to go online in early 2014 - a final decision on the delay is reportedly due next week. Chip equipment stocks were dinged in September on a report Samsung plans to cut its chip capex in half next year. Nov. 5, 2012, 11:10 AM
Lam Research (LRCX +5.4%) pops following its FQ4 report. While results beat estimates, FQ1 guidance for revenue of $820M-$880M and EPS of $0.38-$0.52 is largely below a consensus of $927M and $0.49. But the Street has already priced in a very dour near-term outlook for chip equipment demand. During its earnings call, Lam said it has lowered its 2012 forecast for global chip equipment spending to $28B-$29B - that's below the $31.4B (-13% Y/Y) recently forecast by Gartner.

More on chip equipment stocks: Also hurting their cause is a somewhat bearish note from Citi. The firm is downgrading Lam Research (LRCX), and cutting estimates for Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). However, Citi remains bullish on KLA on expectations the company will benefit from TSMC's (TSM) 20nm process investments, and a shift in Apple processor orders from Samsung to TSMC. TSMC is expected to boost its 2013 capex by 35%, partially offsetting Samsung's cutbacks.

Chip equipment stocks plunge following a report Samsung (SSNLF.PK) will cut its chip capex by half next year, following a major 2012 increase. AMAT -2%. KLAC -3.6%. LRCX -3.3%. UTEK -2.9%. ASML -2.6%. CYMI -3.1%. Barclays is "highly skeptical" of the report, but does think Samsung's capex could fall by a third. On the flip side, the report is giving a lift to SanDisk (SNDK +3.8%) and Micron (MU +3%), given it bodes well for next year's DRAM and NAND flash supply/demand balances. Sep. 19, 2012, 11:30 AM
Ultra Clean Technologies (UCTT) -13.4% AH after warning it expects Q3 revenue of $96M-$101M, below a $109.9M consensus. Expected EPS of $0.10-$0.14 is in-line with a $0.12 consensus. The chip equipment maker blames weak industry demand. Also, Ultra Clean says a major customer to in-source gas panel manufacturing could have a 7%-9% revenue impact by the end of 2013. Applied Materials warned last month, and reported a major drop in chip equipment bookings last week.

Aug. 21, 2012, 6:30 PM
Applied Materials (AMAT +1.5%) has turned positive in spite of providing dismal guidance and bookings data to go with its FQ3 beat, and getting downgraded Susquehanna and CLSA. Huge stock buybacks, a rock-bottom valuation, and hopes for a year-end rebound are probably helping. Needham (Hold) is worried a recovery won't include orders from memory makers, and also doubts AMAT can outperform its peers. Chip stocks are doing well today (SOXX +1.7%). (transcript)

Needham offers a cautiously optimistic take on the chip equipment industry. While granting warnings from AMAT and MTSN indicate another industry downturn is beginning, the firm is encouraged by more positive comments from KLAC, UTEK, and NVMI, and thinks AMAT's 2H view about demand from chip foundries is "overly cautious." Most chip equipment names now trade at single-digit multiples of their 2011 and expected 2013 EPS. (SIA data) Jul. 11, 2012, 2:19 PM
Applied Materials (AMAT) -6.5% after warning it expects FY12 (ends in Oct.) revenue and EPS to be below prior guidance ranges of $9.1B-$9.5B and  $0.85-$0.95 (consensus stands at $9.5B and $0.94). AMAT blames weak chip equipment demand from foundries. Lower in sympathy: KLAC -1.9%. LRCX -2.5%. However, ASML is up 8.2% following its deal with Intel, and rival Cymer (CYMI) is up 3.5%. Recent data has suggested the chip equipment industry's recovery is stalling.

Gartner predicts the chip equipment market will decline 8.9% this year to $33B, as a recent rebound in orders loses momentum. Moreover, while the market is expected to grow 7.4% next year, it will remain smaller than in 2011. Improving chip manufacturing yields are seen hurting demand, though Gartner expects higher capacity utilization to lead to a gradual pickup. Trade association SEMI's latest book-to-bill data indicates demand is starting to falter.

Jun. 25, 2012, 1:26 PM
The book-to-bill ratio for North American chip equipment makers was 1.05 in May, according to SEMI's preliminary estimate. That represents a decline from March's 1.12 and April's 1.10, and suggests the recent rebound in chip equipment orders (fueled by strong demand from TSMC and other foundries) is losing steam. The weak guidance delivered on Tuesday by FSI International (FSII) heightened fears of an industry slowdown.

Needham makes a bearish call on chip equipment stocks, and is downgrading Applied Materials (AMAT +0.1%), Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT -4.3%), and Nova Measuring (NVMI -2.9%) in the process. The firm thinks order rates from major chip manufacturers are decelerating, and is less confident memory capex (ed: no doubt affected by Elpida's bankruptcy and falling flash prices) will rebound in the near-term. Thus, it thinks the Street's growth forecasts are too high.
